The fact that the President—George Bush's first foreign visit has our country as its destination is a clear message of the interest his administration places on strengthening links with Mexico,2,9770
" I also acknowledge President Bush's demonstration of friendship by coming to Guanajuato, the cradle of Mexico's independence",2,3631

President's Visit to MexicoQ,1,270

" Here we are in the process of building up and constructing a strategy to foster the economic and human development of a complete region that is formed by three countries that have been associated under a free trade agreement, and the direct relationship between the United States and Mexico that has proven already—that has made advancements very constructively",2,3723
" It has meant development and employment in Mexico, as well",1,7022
This is what has allowed us to reduce substantially the level of poverty in Mexico,2,2403
 and Mexico,1,5846
" We spoke about the California problems, by itself, and, yes, we are speaking about the possibility of creating an energy policy that will be common to all the northern part of the country and into Canada, the United States, and Mexico and part of Central America, to try to create a synergy or a synergism so that each one of the countries would benefit from all these policies, because there is energy that we need to import in Mexico that we do not have enough, and at this moment we know in some part of the U",1,4004
" First of all, good energy policy is one that encompasses not only Mexico but Canada",1,7368
 We talked about the possibility of exploration in Canada and the United States and Mexico,1,308
" A cubic foot of gas imported into Mexico is one, obviously, less able to burn in the United States",1,8081
" And we're going to need to—so when we talk about an energy policy at home, it is also in the context of Mexico and Canada",1,507
 It's an issue that is going to affect the people of Mexico and the people of the United States if we don't recognize that we need more supply,1,3072
"We have a great opportunity to come together and have a strategy that honors Mexico and honors its sovereignty and, at the same time, recognizes that people are what matters most",2,2276
I've talked to the President of Mexico about a policy,1,8585
"[At this point, President Ricardo Lagos of Chile, President Fernando de la Rua of Argentina, and President Vicente Fox of Mexico each made brief remarks in Spanish",1,7811
 Canada has benefited; Mexico has benefited; the United States has benefited,2,3176
" President Bush, the United States Secretary of the Treasury gave direct financial aid to Mexico to overcome the tequila crisis and to stop propagation to the rest of the region",1,5732
" Given the economic financial crisis in Argentina is already spreading to neighboring countries such as Brazil, I'd like to know if the United States plans to give direct financial aid to Argentina, as it did with Mexico in the past?President Bush",2,9192
" I am from a newspaper in Mexico City, and I have a question addressed to President Bush and to Prime Minister Jean Chretien",1,2673
" Mexico, there is an issue that is of great interest, and I'm referring now to the power issue",1,6926
" I have talked with President Fox about that, not only when I was in Mexico but also earlier this week, and will discuss this very issue with the Prime Minister and the President right after this press conference",1,7434
"Part of our issue is to make sure our electricity grids are open enough to handle additional power, say, in the western part of our State, obviously the western part of Mexico",1,9953
" It is important for our hemisphere to not only trade liberally but to move energy throughout the hemisphere as needed, and it starts with the cooperation between Mexico, Canada, and the United States",2,4669
" You're developing closer relations with Nigeria, Mexico, and Canada",1,1675

" President, you said yesterday that you oppose blanket amnesty for illegal immigrants from Mexico",0,477
 They are not only reviewing our policy in our own working group; they are reviewing the policy with their counterparts in Mexico,1,3044
 Is this a question or a speech?Mexico-U,1,5464
" Well, I respond by saying that, first of all, I can't think of anything more important for our foreign policy in our hemisphere than to have good relations with Mexico",1,4538
" Mexico is our neighbor, and we ought to have a neighborhood that is prosperous and peaceful",2,899
" And I have got a great relation with the President of Mexico, symbolized by the fact that the first state dinner I'm going to have is with Vicente Fox, and it's going to happen in 2 weeks",2,4944
"I think the more that we can coordinate in--with Canada, as well as Mexico, a country that has already shown interest in leadership on this issue--and when I spoke to President Calderon, he indicated this is an area of interest to him--the more that, within this hemisphere, we can show leadership, I think the more likely it is that we can draw in countries like China and India, whose participation is absolutely critical for us to be able to solve this problem over the long term",2,7800
 But your aides said that you would be trying to convince our friends in Canada and in Mexico of the rightness of your position,1,4651
" And I think it is important, whether we're talking about our relationships with Canada or our relationships with Mexico, that all countries concerned are thinking about how workers are being treated and all countries concerned are thinking about environmental issues of the sort that Emmanuelle [Emmanuelle Latraverse, Radio-Canada] just raised earlier",1,9276
"Is Lourdes [Lourdes Meluza] here, from Univision?Mexico-U",1,9767

" audience, and other cooperation--ways of cooperation in climate change, such as something that Mexico has proposed called the Green Fund",1,8894
 We would also like to thank--to welcome the possibility that Mexico might be the seat of the 16th U,2,4344
"We have recognized and acknowledged, ladies and gentlemen, that Mexico and the United States do not have to compete among themselves, but rather they must be able to take advantage of the complementary nature of their economies in order to compete as partners with regard to other parts of the world",2,2639
" to travel to Cuba and to be able to send remittances, Mexico acknowledges that this is a very constructive, positive step for the hemispheric relations, particularly for the region",1,3175
 I want to begin by thanking the people of Mexico for their gracious welcome,1,652
"You know, this is my first trip to Mexico as President, and I see this visit, as I know President Calderon does, as an opportunity to launch a new era of cooperation and partnership between our two countries, an era built on an even firmer foundation of mutual responsibility and mutual respect and mutual interest",2,1474
We also discussed our shared interest in meeting an immigration challenge that has serious implications for both the United States and for Mexico,2,569
 My country has been greatly enriched by migration from Mexico,2,4050
" And I'm committed to working with President Calderon to promote the kind of bottom-up economic growth here in Mexico that will allow people to live out their dreams here and, as a consequence, will relieve some of the pressures that we've seen along the borders",2,388
" And I want to commend him for the work that he's already made in cutting greenhouse gas emissions, the commitment that he's made even though Mexico is not required to do so under the Kyoto Protocol",2,3813
 I commend Mexico for the successes that have already been achieved,2,6814
 But I will not pretend that this is Mexico's responsibility alone,2,501
" More than 90 percent of the guns recovered in Mexico come from the United States, many from gun shops that line our shared border",1,5097
 And we are absolutely committed to working in a partnership with Mexico to make sure that we are dealing with this scourge on both sides of the border,2,2919
 And that's why the United States is taking the following steps: We've begun to accelerate efforts to implement the Merida Initiative so we can provide Mexico with the military aircraft and inspection equipment they need when they need it,2,2084
" law, clearing the way for our Treasury Department, working together with Mexico, to freeze their assets and subject them to sanctions",2,2294
" And I continue to believe that we can respect and honor the second amendment rights in our Constitution, the rights of sportsmen and hunters and homeowners who want to keep their families safe to lawfully bear arms, while dealing with assault weapons that, as we now know, here in Mexico, are helping to fuel extraordinary violence--violence in our own country as well",1,5412
"And so our focus is to work with Secretary Napolitano, Attorney General Holder, our entire Homeland Security team, ATF, border security, everybody who is involved in this, to coordinate with our counterparts in Mexico to significantly ramp up our enforcement of existing laws",2,6030
" and Mexico, we have had an open, frank, trusting conversation between President Obama and myself",1,5922
"From the moment that the prohibition of--on the sale of assault weapons a few years ago, we have seen an increase in the power of organized crime in Mexico",1,5639
-Mexico border--only at the border,1,950
"On the other hand, I do believe that our relationship--the new era we must build in our relationship between Mexico and the United States must be one with trust and respect",2,5872
" I personally believe that as long as we are able to explain clearly what our problems in Mexico are, then we might also be able to seek a solution that--respecting the constitutional rights of the Americans, at the same time, will prevent--or rather avoid that organized crime becomes better armed in our country",2,8091
" For example, in armament, it is not only a matter of seeing whether we can change the legislation on assault weapons--we have already said what our position is--but we might also be able to see whether they can apply existing legislation in Mexico and the United States on armament",1,9035
" For example, in Mexico it's a matter of enforcement with the Export Control Act",1,6307
 And that is the case of Mexico,1,7722
" law that prohibits the sale of these weapons and their export to Mexico, we can move a great deal forward",1,7893
One more thing I forgot to mention: One other thing we can do is to track the weapons that we have in Mexico,1,1421
" If we manage to detect weapons sold illegally in the United States in violation of this law on the control of weapons exports, or if, in the United States, they can have--probably move forward on a good registry of armament or on the prohibition of certain massive sales of weapons, for example, to a hunter or to a common citizen--we know that these people do not usually buy hundreds of rifles or assault weapons or of grenades--if we can move forward in those areas, I do believe that security both of Mexico--both of the United States and Mexico will improve, because those weapons are pointing against Mexican people and Mexican officials today",1,2309
But crime is not only acting in Mexico; it is also acting in the United States,1,2248
" And I do hope that those weapons that are sold today in the United States and are being used in Mexico, I hope the day will never come in which they will also be used against the North American society or against U",1,441
" officials, just like they are now being used in Mexico",1,609
Mexico-U,1,9054
" As of today, how can we establish the concrete objectives that in 2012 will allow us to say, fine, a new era began between Mexico and the United States back then?Particularly I'm addressing this to you, President Obama",2,9808
" In addition to the chance that you will invest your political capital in being able to stop the flow of these weapons to Mexico, what can we hope for? How--what can we expect to see in terms of arresting the drug lords, the kingpins in the U",1,8993
" And a former President of Mexico, ex-President Fox, said that in the back they have only gotten little pats in the back from his predecessors",1,7757
 You can't just have Mexico making an effort but the United States not making an effort,1,8472
"And so we're going to work as hard as we can and as diligently as we can on these issues, always mindful, though, that the relationship between Mexico and the United States cannot just be defined by drugs",2,6838
" But with a very difficult crime rate that we had last year, despite them, crime in Mexico was 10",2,755
"I believe one issue has to be, of course, that we have to cut down on crime in Mexico, for sure, but, number two, I hope, in the course of time, to be a safer border and a more efficient border",2,9105
" As long as--if we are able to stop the flow of drugs, illicit money, and weapons, we will have greater progress both in the United States and Mexico",1,5945
"Now, in the midterm, we would like a renewal of our police forces in Mexico",1,1877

" ally? And Madam Prime Minister, if I may ask you as well, are you concerned about the state of relations between the United States and Mexico? Sir",0,1232

 I have been very strong on Mexico,2,9139
 I have great respect for Mexico,2,7845
" But as you know, Mexico—with the United States—has outnegotiated us and beat us to a pulp through our past leaders",0,9211
 We have a trade deficit of $60 billion with Mexico,0,7864
" And so we are going to renegotiate our trade deals, and we are going to renegotiate other aspects of our relationship with Mexico",0,8041
" I think you'll hear that from the President, and I think you'll hear that from the people of Mexico that really represent him and represent him very well",2,9288
" As the President himself has said, the relationship of the United States with Mexico is a matter for the United States and Mexico",2,3205

" In my opinion, Mexico has been very difficult, as they should be",0,8783
" And I can understand why Mexico is being difficult, because why wouldn't they be? They've had it their way",0,2838
"But no, Mexico will pay for the wall",0,4782
" As you know, Mexico has a tremendous crime problem—tremendous—one of the number two or three in the world",1,9838

" Great respect for Canada, great love for Canada, but it's been a one-sided deal for Canada and for Mexico",1,2442
" Mexico, you see what's happening there",1,6007
 Mexico is not doing particularly well when it comes to the kind of thing that we have great interest in,0,5738
" And if we're able to make a deal with Canada and Mexico in NAFTA, then there will be no reason to do the tariffs with Canada and Mexico",1,5131
" border along with Mexico? Thank you, sir",1,4654
" Hopefully, Congress will get their act together and get in and create some very powerful laws, like Mexico has and like Canada has and like almost all countries have",1,2874
