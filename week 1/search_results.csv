Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Mr. President. This morning I have held very productive and cordial talks with the President of the United States, Mr. George W. Bush. We have agreed on a set of principles and values to provide our relationship as neighbors with more constructive dynamics of more intense cooperation, in order to unfold all the potential of our bilateral relations.
The fact that the President—George Bush's first foreign visit has our country as its destination is a clear message of the interest his administration places on strengthening links with Mexico. At the same time, it is quite a distinction.
This starting point is very encouraging, so that both Mexicans and Americans, together, to inaugurate an era of shared prosperity together. I also acknowledge President Bush's demonstration of friendship by coming to Guanajuato, the cradle of Mexico's independence. And I am particularly grateful for his greeting my mother, Dona Mercedes, as well as for his visit to my house—his house—here in San Cristobal.
Let me tell you, Mr. President, that you will always be welcome in this, your home—or, in your language, President, you know that we consider you a friend of Mexico, a friend of Mexican people, and a friend of mine.
The agreements we have reached today are embodied in the document that we have, and we ratified our commitment to values of democracy and the promotion of human rights, as well as the aim of the fruits of development reach all sectors of our society.
The global and hemispheric agenda, also an important part of our talks, as is fitting in a mature dialog between two prominent members of the international community. We have identified a renewed will for cooperation to design, together with our Canadian partners, a region guided by the search for shared prosperity.
We, the Presidents of Mexico and the United States, have the favorable circumstance of beginning our respective mandates simultaneously. This enables us to project our common objectives with a long-term vision and to undertake negotiations in areas that require a decisive and systematic impetus from the two governments.
Mr. President Bush, the spirit in which we have conducted this first working meeting marks the beginning of a novel stage in our bilateral relations. I am certain that we will be able to take advantage of the historic opportunity we have today to set out on the way to a century of shared prosperity. We will face this challenge on the basis of mutual trust, with a fresh and creative vision to advance in the topics of our bilateral agenda.
Once again, welcome, and this is your home.
President Bush. Muchas gracias, amigo, el Presidente de Mexico. Su recepcion tan calida refleja el grande amistad entre nuestros pueblos. Me hace sentir que estoy entre familia.
Thank you very much. It's a great honor to come to Mexico as this important nation enjoys a new birth of freedom, signaled by President Fox's election. Our meetings today have been a really good opportunity to renew our personal friendship and the friendship between Mexico and the United States.
Mexico is the first foreign country I have visited as President, and I intended it to be that way. Our nations are bound together by ties of history, family, values, commerce, and culture. Today, these ties give us an unprecedented opportunity. We have a chance to build a partnership that will improve the lives of citizens in both countries.
I came here today to seek President Fox's views on how we can go about building on our partnership. We enjoyed a warm and substantive and frank dialog on the many issues that shape the relationship between America and Mexico.
We talked about strengthening our trade relationship, which offers hope and opportunity on both sides of our border. We talked about how our two nations can work together to meet our current and future energy needs. We exchanged ideas about safe and orderly migration, a policy that respects individuals on both sides of the border. We talked about expanding educational opportunities. We talked about what we can do together to fight drug trafficking and other types of organized crime.
We also talked about what we can do together to extend the benefits of freedom and prosperity throughout the entire hemisphere. I told President Fox that building a hemisphere of freedom will be a fundamental commitment of my administration. We both look forward to discussing these ideas with other hemispheric leaders in Quebec in April at the Summit of the Americas.
We are welcoming a new day in the relationship between America and Mexico. Each nation has a new President and a new perspective. Geography has made us neighbors. Cooperation and respect will make us partners. And the promise of the partnership was renewed and reinvigorated today.
Thank you very much.
President Fox. If I understood correctly, we're going to take questions in Spanish for the Mexican press, and some questions in English for the American press. So we'll go first to the women first, and here we'll take the Spanish question first.
Immigration Policy/Situation in Iraq
Q. I have two questions, one for the President of Mexico. We've spoken about new agreements and a new path on migration issues. What has been the advancements on the two topics as you—your campaign to open the border for the free transit of people and to have the free trade agreement in the same way that the European Community has done it?
You talked to President Bush about the amnesty, about the illegal aliens in the United States. I have a question for President Bush. What is the message that you want to send right now? What does the United States want to send to the world as a message with the new bombing of Iraq? And above all, why, Mr. Bush, at this point, when you are establishing a dialog with the President of Mexico—why? Is this a beginning of a new war?
President Fox. Actually, we discussed amply the migration issues that we have. But this is not the meeting in which decisions or details are going to be reached, because they do not belong in the power of—the executive power, as such, because they have to have the participation of other groups.
We have spoken on migration from the viewpoint of our countrymen that are in the United States, and we have spoken about the possibilities of working on agreements of temporary legal work and employment. We have spoken on the firm idea that we have of fighting violence against immigrants and to work based on the law and to see how the ""coyotes"" and all the people that will be taking these people— or the polleros taking our illegal workers into U.S. territory.
We have spoken of a long-term vision and approach and constructive approach on this topic. And perhaps here, the most important thing will be presented by President Bush later on. But certainly there is a new attitude; there is a new way of approaching things, much more positive approach to things on this issue of migration.
The conclusion has been to create a commission at the highest level, as it was read in the Guanajuato Proposal, to begin and to discuss and to advance on this topic on very concrete steps. I believe this is a great advancement on what we had before.
President Bush. In answer to part B of your question, the United States is engaged in the Middle East and Persian Gulf. We will remain so. Since 1991, our country has been enforcing what's called a no-fly zone. A routine mission was conducted to enforce the no-fly zone, and it is a mission about which I was informed and I authorized. But I repeat, it is a routine mission, and we will continue to enforce the no-fly zone until the world is told otherwise.
Mr. Fournier [Ron Fournier, Associated Press].
Q. Sir, as you say, this is the first military action you've taken as President of the United States. I'm wondering whether it signals a hardening of the U.S. position towards Iraq. And specifically, is it your goal to drive Saddam Hussein from power? And secondly, are you putting Saddam on notice today that American military action will be more frequent or more forceful than it was before you became President?
President Bush. Mr. Fournier, Saddam Hussein has got to understand that we expect him to conform to the agreement that he signed after Desert Storm. We will enforce the no-fly zone, both south and north. Our intention is to make sure that the world is as peaceful as possible. And we're going to watch very carefully as to whether or not he develops weapons of mass destruction, and if we catch him doing so, we'll take the appropriate action.
President Fox/Drug Certification
Q. Mr. President, President Bush, welcome to Mexico. We will be waiting for you in Cancun. The question is on globalization; the question, support to Mexico. And another question, certification in Mexico, will it continue? Will it disappear forever? Would you trust our friend Fox?
President Bush. The question is on drug certification and really about our relations with President Fox. I trust your President. He's the kind of man you can look in the eye and know he's shooting straight with you. I appreciate the fact that he was a one-time Governor. I've got kind of partiality to Governors.
We need to work together on the drug issue. One of the reasons why drugs are shipped—the main reason why drugs are shipped through Mexico to the United States is because United States citizens use drugs. And our Nation must do a better job of educating our citizenry about the dangers and evils of drug use.
Secondly, I believe there is a movement in the country to review all the certification process. I'm certainly going to take the message back to the Members of Congress that I firmly believe that President Fox will do everything in his power to root out the drug lords and to halt drug trafficking as best as he possibly can. As you know, he made some very bold and courageous statements about extradition. He showed unique leadership on that issue. It certainly caught my attention. And I believe when the American people and the Members of Congress hear this bold action that he's willing to take, they will understand what I know, that he is committed to battling the drug trade.
Jim—Steve, [Steve Holland, Reuters] sorry. You are? [Laughter] We've got you out of order—I know you're Steve. Stefan, hombre muy bueno.
Tax Relief Legislation
Q. Sir, now that Republicans have told you there are not enough votes for your tax plan in the Senate, how do you proceed from here? And do you consider cutting the size of it?
President Bush. His question was about our tax plan. I don't agree with that assessment, that there are not enough votes in the Senate. I believe when it's all said and done, we're going to get a tax bill out of the House and the Senate that will be at the level I think it ought to be. I know there is a lot of speculation about Members, but it's early—it's early in the process.
Washington, Mr. President, has got a unique way of asking Presidents to negotiate with themselves. And that's not what is going to happen in this administration. We'll get a tax package because it's the right thing for the American people.
Ours, Mr. President, is getting ready to submit a budget that will set priorities: Education will be a priority; health care for our citizens will be a priority; setting aside Social Security—all the payroll taxes for Social Security will be a priority. We've still got money left over, and I want to pass some of it back to the people who pay the bills, in order to make sure our economy does not drag.
And the President and I talked about economic growth. He knows exactly what I know, that if our economy were to slow significantly, it would affect our abilities to see the benefits of free trade; it would affect the Mexican economy.
And so I want to assure our friends from Mexico that we will put fiscal and monetary—I have nothing to do with monetary policy, of course—but fiscal policy in place that will affect economic growth, because it is beneficial not only for our people but for the Mexican people.
Look, to answer your question directly, we are going to get a good tax cut through, and I think it is going to be the size I'm suggesting.
Situation in Iraq
Q. To President Fox, since you two are working together on several actions that you want to undertake together in a short future and also in the long-term future, do you support the military actions like the ones like the United States is doing, bombing Iraq? Thank you.
President Fox. I do not have a position or a statement on that topic, specifically because this will be done through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the future.
It's your turn.
President Bush. Short answer, Mr. President. [Laughter]
Campbell Brown [NBC News].
President's Visit to Mexico
Q. Much has been made of you choosing Mexico as your first foreign trip. But it is also causing consternation among the European allies and Canada that you are going to put a greater emphasis here at the expense of those countries. What do you say to that, please?
President Bush. Well, I appreciate that question. First, I met with Prime Minister Chretien and assured him that a vision of— a foreign policy that understands good policy starts in the neighborhood is a vision that goes both north and south.
I would hope that nations around the world, and leaders, would understand the logic behind saying that good foreign policy, good relations must be firm on our borders. I can't think of anything more logical and more commonsensical than to understand our hemisphere, which can be and will be bound by freedom and free markets and free trade, is in the interests of our people.
We'll have a foreign policy—one that engages the world. I've rejected isolationism, as you know, and protectionism. Ours is going to be an active foreign policy. It's going to be consistent and firm, one that starts, though, by building friendships, in this case, renewing a friendship. And it should send a strong signal to all nations who watch that if you're our friend, we'll be your friend. And Mexico is our friend and will remain our friend.
Q. Thank you very much, Presidents. A question for President Fox: Do you think that it is not an improper gesture in this for a visit, that the recent bombing of Iraq is what is attracting the attention and would put a shade or a shadow on this meeting here in Guanajuato?
President Fox. I see no reason why we should connect one event with the other one. Here we are in the process of building up and constructing a strategy to foster the economic and human development of a complete region that is formed by three countries that have been associated under a free trade agreement, and the direct relationship between the United States and Mexico that has proven already—that has made advancements very constructively.
The levels of trade that we have had are really fantastic, and they are the envy of many people—many people who had never thought that this year of 2001 with a trade balance of $250 billion. This has meant development for the United States. It has meant employment in the United States. It has meant development and employment in Mexico, as well.
This is what has allowed us to reduce substantially the level of poverty in Mexico. In the last 4 years, more than 4 million poor people have gone beyond extreme poverty levels. This is what we have invested on, to take these people above this level. And all the time that we have invested, discussing these strategic points, allow us to see that there is a possibility of going ahead to get more benefits from good relationships and to be true partners toward prosperity and to be true friends and to be true neighbors.
And this purpose is something that has been clearly stated today, and we're very pleased with it. And we are full of confidence that we can see the future with a more optimistic approach as of today's meeting.
Situation in Iraq
Q. Apologies to you, Presidente Fox, for not asking a question about the U.S. and Mexico. But President Bush, if I may, another question about Iraq: As we understand it, this was in response to violations that have happened over several weeks, perhaps several months. What prompted you to take this decision at this time?
President Bush. The commanders on the ground, rightly, make the decision as to how to enforce the no-fly zone. I want to assure those who don't understand U.S. policy that this is a routine mission. Some of the missions require the Commander in Chief to be informed. This was such a mission. It is not the first time it has happened, regrettably so.
We will continue to enforce the no-fly zones. The no-fly zones are enforced on a daily basis. It is a part of a strategy, and until that strategy is changed, if it is changed at all, we will continue to enforce the no-fly zone.
But anyway, the decision is made on the ground, Jim [Jim Angle, Fox News].
Energy Policy
Q. I would like to ask you whether there was a petition from the U.S. Government as far as oil is concerned, or any requests for support on electricity and oil?
President Fox. No, not specifically. We spoke about the California problems, by itself, and, yes, we are speaking about the possibility of creating an energy policy that will be common to all the northern part of the country and into Canada, the United States, and Mexico and part of Central America, to try to create a synergy or a synergism so that each one of the countries would benefit from all these policies, because there is energy that we need to import in Mexico that we do not have enough, and at this moment we know in some part of the U.S. territory, this is happening, too. And the same could happen to the Central American countries.
Here, what is important is to have a common policy whereby no one takes advantage of the other. But the other way around it, and it's a win/win situation for everyone, that everyone would be benefited from the organization of an energy plan for the benefit of all the continent of, in this case, the northern part of the Americas.
We also spoke about water problems at the border zones. These are common problems that we have, and if we administer and manage these common problems in a timely manner, in a positive and optimistic way, we could mutually be benefited in the water problems that we have at the border. And this is something that obviously we discussed here.
I believe this is the foundation that we laid down for our project today. And we are trying with good will to remove all the obstacles and to take advantage of all the opportunities that we have. And certainly, today we saw more opportunities than obstacles. And therefore, I do ratify that this makes us see the near future with much more optimism than before.
Q. Mr. President, when you met with President Fox in August in Dallas, you talked about the possibility of finding ways to share energy resources. With the current climate in America—energy prices high, supplies low—can you tell me how you pushed that issue today——
President Bush. Yes, I appreciate that.
Q. ——and what sense of progress you have?
President Bush. The question was about energy policy. First of all, good energy policy is one that encompasses not only Mexico but Canada. We must think about energy shortages and energy demands in regards to our hemisphere.
Secondly, the President and I did discuss how best to share resources to the benefit of both countries. We talked about the possibility of exploration in Canada and the United States and Mexico. A cubic foot of gas imported into Mexico is one, obviously, less able to burn in the United States. It is a hemispheric issue, and it needs to be elevated to the Presidential level.
We did talk about power, the generation of power; the possibility as to whether or not in Baja, for example, more power could be added to the western grid. It's an obvious opportunity, if possible. Now, there are some bottlenecks, and one of the things we need to do is address those bottlenecks, one of which is the ability to transmit power from south to north.
Now, there is pipeline availability. And we're going to need to—so when we talk about an energy policy at home, it is also in the context of Mexico and Canada. This is an issue where we need to continue the dialog. It's an issue that is going to affect the people of Mexico and the people of the United States if we don't recognize that we need more supply.
We can conserve better. There's no question about it. But demand is far outstripping supply, which is creating a real problem for the working people of our respective countries. And so this subject, rightly so, took quite a bit of time in our meeting and is going to take more time down the road.
We have a great opportunity to come together and have a strategy that honors Mexico and honors its sovereignty and, at the same time, recognizes that people are what matters most. And we've got to make sure our people have got the energy necessary to be able to find jobs and find work.
President Fox. We are finished.
Thank you very much for coming to the press conference. Good luck, and thank you.
President Bush. They just want to get in the picture."
"March 29, 2001",The President's News Conference,George W. Bush,"George W. Bush, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/213873",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1237,"The President. Good morning. I first want to say how pleased I am that the House yesterday passed on a realistic, commonsense budget to the Senate. I appreciated the vote. They did the right thing. It's a budget that meets our Nation's priorities. It's also a budget that leaves ample room for meaningful, real, long-lasting tax relief. I look forward to working with the Senate to get a budget passed.
I'm also deeply concerned about the escalating violence in the Middle East. It is claiming the lives of innocent civilians on both sides. The tragic cycle of incitement, provocation, and violence has gone on far too long. Both sides must take important steps to calm the situation now.
The Palestinian Authority should speak out publicly and forcibly, in a language that the Palestinian people—to condemn violence and terrorism. It should arrest those who perpetrated the terrorist acts. It should resume security cooperation with Israel.
The Government of Israel, for its part, should exercise restraint in its military response. It should take steps to restore normalcy to the lives of the Palestinian people by easing closures and removing checkpoints. Last week Prime Minister Sharon assured me that his government wants to move in this direction, and I urge Israel to do so.
I'll be meeting with Egypt's President Mubarak next Monday and Jordan's King Abdullah the week after, to seek their help in defusing the tensions. Egypt and Jordan are two of our most important partners in the region, and their role is crucial.
I've asked Secretary Powell to call Chairman Arafat today and contact other leaders to urge them to stand against violence. Our diplomats in the region are fully engaged in this effort.
Our goal is to encourage a series of reciprocal and parallel steps by both sides that will halt the escalation of violence, provide safety and security for civilians on both sides, and restore normalcy to the lives of everyone in the region. A lasting peace in the region will come only when the parties agree directly on its terms.
This week I vetoed an unbalanced U.N. resolution, because it tried to force the adoption of a mechanism on which both parties did not agree. My approach will be to facilitate the parties' work in finding their own solution to peace. We seek to build a stable foundation for restoring confidence, rebuilding security cooperation, and resuming a political dialog between the parties.
I'll be glad to answer some questions. Ron [Ron Fournier, Associated Press].
Campaign Finance Reform Legislation
Q. Mr. President, the Senate, as you know, is finishing up legislation to ban all soft money. What do you think of the bill, particularly the ban on individual contributions that you forcefully opposed in the campaign? And specifically, sir, would you sign it?
The President. This is a bill in progress. It's a bill that continues to change, and I'll take a look at it when it makes my desk. And if it improves the system, I'll sign it. I look forward to signing a good piece of legislation.
Q. Could you sign a bill that bans individual soft money contributions?
The President. I'll look at the whole bill, and I'll make my determination as to whether or not the bill improves the situation. And I appreciate the hard work that's being done on the legislation, and I'm going to wait until I see the final version.
Yes, Helen [Helen Thomas, Hearst Newspapers].
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Sorry.
Russia/Weapons of Mass Destruction
Q. Mr. President, is your administration reviewing U.S. aid to Russia to stop the spread of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons? Are you considering reducing that aid, and if so, why?
The President. Well, we're reviewing all programs, those related to deescalating potential nuclear problems. We want to make sure that any money that is being spent is being spent in an effective way—have the obligation to the taxpayers to make sure that the money, for example, going to the Russian program, part of Nunn-Lugar, for example, is effective. And so we're putting a full review on the programs.
And we fully intend to continue to cooperate with the Russians. It's in our Nation's best interest to dismantle—work with Russia to dismantle its nuclear arsenal. I was pleased to see that Senator Nunn, one of the authors of the Nunn-Lugar bill, agreed with our approach to take a look to make sure the programs are efficient. And we will continue to do so.
Helen.
Environmental Regulations
Q. Mr. President, in the last few weeks you have rolled back health and safety and environmental measures proposed by the last administration and other previous administrations. This has been widely interpreted as a payback time to your corporate donors. Are they more important than the American people's health and safety? And what else do you plan to repeal?
The President. Well, Helen, I told people pretty plainly that I was going to review all the last-minute decisions that my predecessor had made, and that is exactly what we're doing. I presume you're referring to the decision on arsenic in water. First of all, there had been no change in the arsenic—accepted arsenic level in water since the forties. And at the very last minute, my predecessor made a decision, and we pulled back his decision so that we can make a decision based upon sound science and what's realistic. There will be a reduction in the acceptable amount of arsenic per billion after the review in the EPA.
Q. How about stopping the black lung benefits for families? This is sort of—to increase some of the benefits of these miners?
The President. We will work with members of the delegation and make sure people are properly treated. Ours is going to be an administration that makes decisions on science, what's realistic—commonsense decisions.
For example, circumstances have changed since the campaign. We're now in an energy crisis. And that's why I decided to not have mandatory caps on CO2, because in order to meet those caps, our Nation would have had to have had a lot of natural gas immediately flow into the system, which is impossible. We don't have the infrastructure able to move natural gas.
We need to have an active exploration program. One of the big debates that's taking place in the Congress, or will take place in the Congress, is whether or not we should be exploring for natural gas in Alaska, for example, in ANWR. I strongly think we should in order to make sure that we've got enough gas to be able to help reduce greenhouse emissions in the country. See, gas is clean, and yet there is not enough of it. And we've got pipeline capacity problems in the country. We have an energy shortage.
I look forward to explaining this today to the leader of Germany as to why I made the decision I made. We'll be working with Germany; we'll be working with our allies to reduce greenhouse gases. But I will not accept a plan that will harm our economy and hurt American workers.
John [John Roberts, CBS News].
Stimulus Package/Tax Relief Legislation
Q. Mr. President, new figures out today show that the economy grew at an annual rate of one percent for the last 3 months of the year 2000. My question to you, sir, is, what are you prepared to do to immediately stimulate the economy? Because it would appear that your long-term tax package does not do it, yet you dismiss outof-hand attempts from the Hill to give back a rebate of some $60 billion this year unless it's tied to longer term tax relief. Why can you not sign a short-term package and then pursue your long-term package separate to that?
The President. Well, John, first of all, I support the efforts on the Hill to provide immediate tax relief. I've been calling for immediate tax relief. I think it makes sense to do so. But we've got to have long-term relief, as well. Part of building confidence in our economy is not only give the consumers a boost but to have a plan that reduces rates for the long term, so that people who make investments—small-business owners, the entrepreneurs—will have certainty that the cashflows of the future will be enhanced, so they can expand their job base and make new capital purchases.
I appreciate very much what the leadership in the Senate have—Tom Daschle, for example, talked about immediate tax relief or immediate rebates, plus reducing rates permanently. We just need to reduce more rates than the ones he suggested.
There is a debate going on here in Washington, and it's really, do you want to increase the size of the Federal Government, or do you want to give—let people keep their own money? And there's a philosophical divide. And I'm going to continue to stand on the side of the people and make it as clear as I can that we've met our priorities in the budget I submitted, and it's not only good for the economy, though, to give people their money back, it's good for working families, so they can have more money to manage their own accounts.
There's a lot of focus about national debt in Washington. But it's important for Congress not to forget a lot of folks have got consumer debt, as well. And when you couple high energy prices with consumer debt, a lot of folks are in a squeeze. And I look forward to continuing to make the case.
Q. But with respect, sir, as this debate continues, consumers are not seeing any more money back in their pockets.
The President. That's exactly right. And you've got a good point: Consumers haven't seen any money back in their pockets. That's why it's important for the Senate to act quickly on the budget. I hope there's no delay next week when it comes to the budget considerations. I look forward to working with both House Members and Senate Members, once the budgets have been passed, to get tax relief enacted quickly and to get money as quickly as possible into the people's pockets.
Yes, Gregory [David Gregory, NBC News].
Q. Mr. President, you're no longer negotiating with yourself on tax cuts. There are a lot of other approaches that are out there. Why not say today exactly what you're willing to do to appease both moderate Republicans and Democrats who fear that those projected budget surpluses won't materialize, and they want some way to cut off a tax cut, if that's the case, if we can't afford it? What will you do?
The President. Listen, I'm anxious to talk to Members of the Senate about the socalled look-back provisions. But I'm going to remind people that one-way budget surpluses will not materialize is if Congress overspends. And so any look-back procedure has got to make sure that there are restraints to Government spending. The surest way to eat up the surplus is to have the kind of spending that took place during the last fiscal year, when the discretionary spending increased by 8 percent.
And by the way, I'm still negotiating with myself. People keep—I get a suggestion from here and a suggestion from there. Soand-so suggests something. And good Americans, such as yourself, are trying to get me to negotiate with myself.
Q. Can I just——
The President. Yes, you may.
Q. Let me just bring up another suggestion. [Laughter]
The President. Another chance to negotiate with myself?
Q. Will you sign or veto tax cuts that exceed $1.6 trillion, even if it would result from—that increase would result from an immediate stimulus to the economy this year?
The President. David, I hope that Congress does not diminish the size of the tax relief package that I've sent up there nor increase the size of the tax relief package I've sent up there. The 1.6 is the size that I think is right. We've had a lot of discussion here in Washington about whether it's too big or too small. Nothing has changed my opinion as to whether or not—about the size of the package I sent. It's the right size.
[At this point, a beeper went off.]
The President. Don't worry about the beeper violation. [Laughter] It's a new approach. Gordon taught me a lesson.
Situation in the Middle East
Q. On the Middle East, sir. For a couple months, both you and officials in your administration have indicated you wanted to step back from constant involvement of the U.S. and the President in the conflict and in the peace process. Was that a mistake, given the escalation in both violence and the rhetoric over there? And is what you're doing today essentially an admission that the involvement of the United States and the President of the United States, publicly and personally, is necessary for the parties to succeed?
The President. Terry [Terry Moran, ABC News], I have said all along that this Nation will not try to force a peace settlement in the Middle East, that we will facilitate a peace settlement. It requires two willing parties to come to the table to enact a peace treaty that will last. And this administration won't try to force peace on the parties. That's what the U.N. tried to do the other day. They tried to force a situation in the Middle East to which both parties did not agree. That's why I vetoed their suggestion.
We have been fully engaged in the Middle East. We're on the phone all the time to the leaders. I'm welcoming leaders to come. In order for there to be a peace, this country must develop a—what I call a broad foundation for peace. That means we've got to have good, strong relations with the Egyptians and the Jordanians and the Saudis.
As you may remember, the Secretary of State went to Syria to sit down with Bashar. And we've got a lot of work to do in order to build that foundation for peace, but we're going to make a full-time effort to do so.
But our fellow citizens have got to realize that in order for there to be a peace, there has to be two willing parties. And we will continue to try to convince the parties to become willing to sit down and negotiate a lasting peace. But this country cannot impose a timetable nor settlement on the parties if they're unwilling to accept it.
Q. But merely to contain the violence, sir, do you personally need to get more involved? Is that what you're doing today?
The President. I am involved on the telephone. I met with Prime Minister Sharon. I'm talking to our allies and friends in the Middle East. I've instructed the Secretary of State to call Mr. Arafat. And implicit in your question is the first step, and that is, the violence must cease in order for there to be any meaningful dialog in the Middle East. And so we're in the process of trying to bring calm to the region, and it's going to require more than just one voice.
Obviously, our voice is an important voice for bringing calm to the Middle East; so are other nations. And I look forward to visiting with President Mubarak and King Abdullah to lend—to rally them to try to convince, particularly in their case, Mr. Arafat to speak out against violence in a language that the Palestinians can understand.
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Major [Major Garrett, Cable News Network].
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge/Energy Resources
Q. You have mentioned today that there is an energy crisis——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——and yet the budget resolutions that have passed the House and are due to be considered in the Senate next week do not include any revenue from the drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I have talked to the people who have made that decision, and they said it is a political fight, they believe unwinnable, that you could not, nor could they, create the majorities in either the House or the Senate to bring about drilling in ANWR—your number one solution—or one of the top solutions to dealing with the energy crisis. Does this not represent a rejection from your own party in dealing with the energy situation?
The President. Well, Major, first of all, there are other areas in the United States on which we can find natural gas. I think it's important for us to open up ANWR. Whether or not the Congress sees it that way is another matter. That's not going to deter me from having, for example, the Interior Secretary look at all lands that are not—not to be fully protected, for exploration. We've got a plan to make sure that gas comes—flows freely out of Canada into the United States. I talked to the Prime Minister about that.
What I find interesting is that I think— we have meaningful discussions about exploration in the Northwest Territories; right across the line, admittedly miles away, is ANWR. But nevertheless, it's a big, vast region of natural gas. And it's important for us to explore, encourage exploration, work with the Canadians to get pipelines coming out of the Northwest Territories to the United States.
I've talked to the President of Mexico about a policy. There's going to be a lot of areas where we can find natural gas in America other than ANWR. It would be helpful if we opened up ANWR. I think it's a mistake not to. And I would urge you all to travel up there and take a look at it, and you can make——
Q. On energy——
The President. Let me finish please—and you can make the determination as to how beautiful that country is.
Q. If I may follow up.
The President. Yes, Major.
Q. If the American people, looking to you to deal with the energy crisis, and you cannot look to your own party to deal with what you and your own advisers have said is a crucial area in which to explore, how can the American public have confidence in your ability to deal with Congress to address the situation you have called today a crisis?
The President. There's a lot of other areas we can explore, Major, and one of them is to work with the Canadians. There's gas in our hemisphere. And the fundamental question is, where's it going to come from? I'd like it to be American gas. But if the Congress decides not to have for exploration in ANWR, we'll work with the Canadians.
I'm interested in getting more energy supply so that businesses can grow and people can heat their homes. We've got a shortage of energy in America. And it doesn't matter to me where the gas comes from in the long run, just so long as we get gas moving into the country, so long as we increase supply of natural gas.
And we also need to have clean coal technologies, as well. And we need a full affront on a energy crisis that is real in California and looms for other parts of our country if we don't move quickly.
Senator John McCain
Q. Mr. President, as I'm sure you've been aware, there are stories consistently about tensions, persistent tensions between you and Senator John McCain, dating back to your rivalry in the primaries. I wonder if you could address that, not just on the campaign finance reform bill but also on the Patients' Bill of Rights, which McCain supporters believe you don't want to sign a Patients' Bill of Rights with McCain's name on it.
The President. Well, look, this is Washington, DC, gossip, is how I view it. I respect John McCain. I like him a lot. That doesn't mean we're going to agree 100 percent of the time. Obviously, we've got some differences; that's what a primary was all about, airing our differences. But I respect John. I realize—it's a game in Washington to try to create tension between John McCain and me, and I'm not going to let it happen.
I can't control the stories that seem to be popping up all the time—faceless aides that are out there trying to stir the pot. I can just give you my perspective. I like him. He's a good man. We have some differences, and I think the idea, for example, of having a $5 million cap on punitive damages is just not the right public policy. But that shouldn't surprise you. After all, I've signed a bill in the State of Texas with a $750,000 cap on punitive damages. That's nothing personal, just a difference of opinion. And the idea of the President laying out a framework for debate and some guidelines is perfectly acceptable practice in Washington, DC.
Campaign Finance Reform Legislation
Q. Just to follow on that. When you sent the signal, and your aides did, to Congress that they could not count on you to veto a campaign finance reform bill, what message were you sending? A lot of people interpreted it that you're saying to Congress, ""If you don't like it, kill it, because I won't.""
The President. No. As I said, I look forward to signing a bill that makes the process better. Sometimes the legislators will say, ""Oh, don't worry, we've got the President."" I'm not sure exactly what that means, except if a bill that improves the system makes it to my desk, I'll be inclined to sign it. I, of course, reserve all options to bills that are forever changing, and those who follow the process know, but I'm going to—I will make my decision once the bill makes it to my desk.
Chairman Yasser Arafat of the Palestinian Authority
Q. Can I ask about the Palestinians, sir? Why is it that you have not decided to invite Yasser Arafat here? Have you concluded that he's part of the problem, not part of the solution?
The President. Well, we're going to work with all parties. As I mentioned, the Secretary of State is calling Chairman Arafat today to urge him to stop the violence and to call upon those over whom he's got influence to stop the violence. I've got quite a crowded calendar of leaders who are coming to see me, and I'm looking forward to visiting with President Mubarak and King Abdullah.
Mike [Mike Allen, Washington Post].
Q. I'm sorry, can I follow, sir?
The President. No. Just teasing. Go ahead. Just testing. [Laughter]
Q. The Palestinians think you're sending them a signal. Are you?
The President. The signal I'm sending to the Palestinians is, stop the violence. And I can't make it any more clear. And I hope that Chairman Arafat hears it loud and clear. He's going to hear it again on the telephone today. This is not the first time the message has been delivered. It's so important, in order for there to be any kind of discussion about peace, that we stop the violence in the Middle East.
Foreign Relations
Q. Mr. President, allies of the United States have complained that you haven't consulted them sufficiently on your stance for negotiations with North Korea, Kyoto treaty. We have deteriorating relations elsewhere. If you read the international press, it looks like everyone is mad at us. Mr. President, how do you think that came to be, and what, if anything, do you plan to do about it?
The President. Well, I get a completely different picture, of course, when I sit down with world leaders. I'm looking forward to sitting down with Mr. Schroeder here in about 30 minutes. I've had very honest and straightforward visits with many of the world's leaders. There's—I'm sure there were some concerns initially, because they didn't know me, and they heard all kinds of rumors about what our administration would be about. And I now have the chance to sit down and talk to them, face to face.
I'm a pretty straightforward fellow, Mike. I don't mind making my case, and it's important. It's important for world leaders to know exactly where the United States is coming from.
On missile defense, for example, I've assured our allies that we will consult with them. But we're moving forward to develop systems that reflect the threats of today. I mean, who knows where the next terrorist attack is going to come from, but we'd better be ready for it. And I believe I've got the opportunity to convince our friends and allies that our vision makes sense. It brings a lot of common sense to an old, stale debate, the old arms control debate.
In terms of the CO2 issue, I will explain as clearly as I can, today and every other chance I get, that we will not do anything that harms our economy, because first things first are the people who live in America. That's my priority. And I'm worried about the economy. I'm worried about the lack of an energy policy. I'm worried about rolling blackouts in California. It's in our national interest that we develop a strong energy policy, with realistic, commonsense environmental policy. And I'm going to explain that to our friends.
It is in their interest, by the way, that our economy remain strong. After all, we're a free trading administration. We trade with each other. People are beginning to learn what my administration is like. And they're going to find we're steadfast friends. But a friend is somebody who's willing to tell the truth, and if there's a disagreement, to be able to state it clearly, to make it clear where we disagree.
But for those who worry about our willingness to consult, they shouldn't worry. We are. We're going to be openminded, and we'll have open dialog.
Yes, sir.
Q. Mr. President——
Q. Mr. President, you gave me the floor.
The President. You're next. No, next to next. Let me rephrase it: You're last. [Laughter]
Q. No problem.
Tax Relief Legislation
Q. Just to clarify on tax cuts, I wanted to clarify the linkage that you feel is necessary. You have said that you want to have a tax cut rate reduction, and you also support the efforts to try to do a quick retroactive tax cut. When you speak of those two things, will you insist upon one package of bills that includes the rate reduction and any kind of quick short-term stimulus, or would you except some kind of verifiable promise that they'll get to your tax cuts later?
The President. That's the old ""trust me."" [Laughter] Look, it is in our Nation's best interest to have long-term tax relief, and that has been my focus all along. I'm confident we can have it—get it done. I believe not only can we get long-term tax relief in place, since there were countries running some surpluses in spite of the dire predictions about cashflow; I believe we have an opportunity to fashion an immediate stimulus package, as well. The two ought to go hand in hand.
Those who think that they can say we're only going to have a stimulus package, but let's forget tax relief, misunderestimate— excuse me, underestimate—[laughter]—just making sure you were paying attention. [Laughter] You were—[laughter]—underestimate our administration's resolve to get this done.
Q. Can I ask a followup real quick?
The President. No. [Laughter] Go ahead.
Q. Just quickly. The Democrats have demonstrated some flexibility on reducing the lower end of the tax rate reductions. How do you feel about the top? There's talk about the top rate not being as big as you proposed——
The President. Of course we ought to talk the top rate. But see, you're trying to do what Gregory tried to get me to do, which is negotiate with myself again.
Q. What's wrong with that?
Q. I negotiate with Gregory over this——
The President. Please do. When you all come up with a solution, let me know. Gregory is in the top one percent. [Laughter] If not, you should be, David.
Last question.
Free Trade in the Americas
Q. Thank you, sir. Mr. President, you spoke about free trade at the last press conference. You've mentioned it today. You'll be meeting tomorrow with the President of Brazil, Fernando Henrique Cardoso. He is the one person—at least Brazil is the one person in the continent, or the one country, who is not in a rush to come to a free trade agreement. They prefer Mercosur, the free trade agreement in South America. Is your administration interested in getting the free trade agreement by 2003 year instead of the 2005 year that's been agreed? And how do you expect to convince Mr. Cardoso tomorrow to follow that?
The President. Well, I—the sooner we can get a free trade agreement in the hemisphere, the better. As to whether or not it's 2003 or 2005, that's—we'll just have to see if we can't convince our friends in South America of the wisdom of doing it as soon as possible.
The meeting tomorrow is going to be an important meeting. Brazil is a huge country. It's got a significant role in our hemisphere, and it's got a very bright future. To the extent that the country is skeptical about our intention to have free and fair trade, I have a chance to undermine that skepticism, and I'm going to. I'm going to look the man in the eye and say, ""We are free traders."" I will work with—and I'll have Bob Zoellick work with his counterpart to assure him that trade with America will be done in a free and fair way. I think we can make some progress, but we'll see after the meeting.
Thank you all. See you tonight, right? Look, I'm just testing a few lines on you, by the way. [Laughter]
Q. Let's hear a few.
The President. You just heard one, but you'll see when you hear me. [Laughter]"
"April 22, 2001",The President's News Conference With Summit of the Americas Leaders in Quebec City,George W. Bush,"George W. Bush, The President's News Conference With Summit of the Americas Leaders in Quebec City Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/213205",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-summit-the-americas-leaders-quebec-city,"[Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada opened the news conference with brief remarks in French, and a translation was not provided. He then continued in English.]
Prime Minister Chretien. We will start with the President of the United States.
President Bush. Mr. Prime Minister, thank you very much, and congratulations on a very successful summit. I want to thank you and your staff and the people of Quebec City for their hospitality.
I've been most impressed by the discussions we've had. It's clear to me that ours is a hemisphere united by freedom. It's a partnership that will help us tackle the big challenges that we all face: the education of our children, HIV/AIDS, protecting our environment. It's a strong partnership. It's a partnership that will help us all achieve what we want—is that everybody in our respective countries are able to succeed and realize their dreams.
I want to thank my fellow leaders who were here. This is my first summit, as you know. I've been most impressed by the quality of leadership. I am most thankful for the generous hospitality each leader showed me. I listened a lot; I learned a lot. There's no question in my mind we have challenges ahead of us, but there's also no question that we can meet those challenges.
So, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you very much, sir.
Prime Minister Chretien. Thank you, Mr. President. And now we'll ask the President of Chile, Mr. Lagos, to say a few words.
[At this point, President Ricardo Lagos of Chile, President Fernando de la Rua of Argentina, and President Vicente Fox of Mexico each made brief remarks in Spanish. Translations were not provided.]
Prime Minister Chretien. I thank you very much, President Fox. And I now call on President Andres Pastrana.
President Andres Pastrana of Colombia. Thank you, Honorable Right Prime Minister. First, I'd like to thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Chretien, and all of your people for your hospitality in these last few days, hospitality that we have enjoyed in Quebec. I think that those who preceded me have expressed the basic tenets of what has occurred here today. But now I would like to share what President Lagos said— back what he said with regard to the democratic clause and the importance of it for the Americas.
We have put all of our efforts as leaders of our democracies to strengthen our democracies. And as we have said throughout this summit, we must move from a political democracy to an economic democracy. Through that, we can seek improvement of living conditions of the most poor and the neediest amongst us.
If there is something that has brought us together or which unites us or what calls us here today at this summit—what calls 34 heads of state of the Americas together—what calls us together is our concern for human beings and particularly to improve the conditions of life, as I said, for the poorest and the most needy.
And as President Fox said, this is the opportunity to thank all 34 heads of state for their support to state politics, the process of peace in Colombia. Thank you for your support to a political and negotiated solution to the conflict which has torn asunder our country for the last 30 years.
And once again, as says the declaration, we support the peace process. Thank you for your support. And I would also like to call your attention to the uprising, to those behind it, to those who are marginalized and not following the law, and that this is enshrined in our declaration. We can and we will quickly reach humanitarian agreements with regard to the respect of human rights, respecting humanitarian international law, and especially to not exclude the civilian population.
Prime Minister Chretien. And now, I would like to give the floor to President Francisco Flores from El Salvador.
President Francisco Flores Perez of El Salvador. When the whole world is facing a creative, technological, and scientific revolution and countries become more and more integrated, it's key that leaders of the world understand that the possibilities of our countries are based on going from a view of the state as a closed and autonomous organ to a collection of open, integrated societies that support democracy and freedom.
And the definition of a new state is a basis to struggle against poverty, to respect the tremendous diversities that exist in the Americas, and the possibility of moving ahead in the world the way we want to move ahead, especially those of us who believe in principles.
If anything has been learned from the greatest and most recent tragedies in El Salvador, especially the last two earthquakes, is that the foundations of countries are not physical things; they are moral things. They are based on their strength and their belief in principles and in the belief of men, women, and their dignity.
I would like to thank the Government of Canada for hosting this meeting that has confirmed these values, which, I believe, are the basis for hope for the future in the Americas.
Prime Minister Chretien. Thank you. I thank President Flores. I give the floor to Prime Minister Owen Archer of the Barbados.
Prime Minister Owen Archer of Barbados. Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for allowing me the opportunity to share a perspective on behalf of the Caribbean. It is not only the smallest and most vulnerable region in our hemisphere but the smallest and most vulnerable region in the world.
From the outset in 1994, we were very clear that the exercise in which we are involved through these summits is greater than the mere creation of an integrated economic area, but must entail our creation of a program of development cooperation to support the emergence and the evolution of a truly hemispheric community for the Americas. And from the onset, we were clear that the effort had to stand the test of equity, had to stand the test of inclusiveness, and had to stand the test of relevance. It has to be relevant for today's purposes and tomorrow's needs. The Caribbean is pleased to be able to say that this summit has taken us a far distance to being satisfied in all of those tests.
We are not only living in the 21st century; we are now living in a new information age in which there is a great danger of a new dangerous inequality caused by a digital divide. And I believe that in the context of a 21st century society, this summit will stand as that summit where the leaders of the Americas determined that there should be no digital divide in our Americas, that the benefits of the new information technology have been brought within the reach of all of our citizens. Our connectivity agenda is, in my judgment, the most exciting new development from this summit, which I commend to the people of the Caribbean.
We are also very pleased that the arrangements for economic integration have now been so deliberately designed to truly accommodate the special concerns of the smallest and the most vulnerable entities in our hemisphere. And this summit has stood the test of equity.
May I also say, Mr. Prime Minister, that the Caribbean has used this summit, as well, and the meetings in the margin of this summit to lay a foundation for stronger bilateral relationships with our neighbors, particularly the United States of America, Canada, Central America, and the Mercosur countries and the Andean countries, and that we can leave this summit looking to the prospect of being part of a successful partnership in a successful neighborhood of the Americas.
I thank you.
Prime Minister Chretien. Thank you very much, Mr. Prime Minister.
And now the journalists have the floor.
Protesters and the Free Trade Agenda
Q. Mr. President, President Bush, I will direct my question to the Prime Minister of Canada, but we would very much like you to answer the question afterwards, if you don't mind.
[A question was asked and answered in French, and a translation was not provided. Following his response in French, Prime Minister Chretien spoke in English.]
Prime Minister Chretien. So I don't think that it is a question of our legitimacy. We are very legitimate. We were elected, all of us. And when you look at what was the Americas some 30 years ago and what it is today, look at the progress that democracy has made. Look at the clause that we have developed together at this time to make sure that democracy will remain in the Americas.
And a lot of people were invited to comment. We organized a parallel summit, at the expense of the Government. And they met; they discussed; they debated; they met with ministers; there were ministers from my government and ministers from many other Governments that listened to them. And I'm very proud of the unions, for example, who decided to organize a parade of protest. It was done in a very orderly fashion. They made sure that those who wanted to break everything were not part of it.
There were some hundreds of them who had come with the goal of trying to disrupt us, and I want to say a great thank you again to the police of the city of Quebec, of the Province of Quebec and the Federal police for the way that they have handled the situation. We could see it on TV, and the restraint, the discipline they've shown is an example.
I guess in other summits there will still be some protesters, communicating among themselves on the Internet and so on, and they have the right to protest. But we will not tolerate breaking the peace of the people. In a democracy, you have a right to speak, but you have to respect the law.
And I don't know if the President would like to comment on that.
President Bush. Well, let me just say that I campaigned vigorously on a free trade agenda. There should be no question in anybody's mind in my country that I would come to Quebec City to promote trade.
For those who question trade and its benefits, I would urge them to look at the experience that we've had as a result of NAFTA. Canada has benefited; Mexico has benefited; the United States has benefited. Sure, there are going to be some who complain, and that's what happens in a democracy. But the overall benefits have been great for our three countries. And it served as an example to attract the positive opinions of other leaders who came to this summit. It's a positive example for the doubters to look at, for the skeptics to see that wealth can be spread throughout our hemisphere.
And we have a choice to make. We can combine in a common market so we can compete in the long term with the Far East and Europe, or we can go on our own. I submit—and I suspect the other leaders will echo with me; I hope they do, at least—that going on our own is not the right way to do so. Combining in a market in our own hemisphere makes sense. It's a logical extension of what's taken place through NAFTA.
There are some people in my country that want to shut down free trade. And they're welcome to express their opinions. I heard it throughout the campaign. But it's not going to change my opinion about the benefits of free trade, not only for my country and the people who work in my country and the people who wonder whether there's a future in my country, but the benefits of free trade for all the countries of this hemisphere are strong. And I intend to vigorously pursue a free trade agenda.
Prime Minister Chretien. Thank you.
Next.
Missionary Aircraft Incident in Peru
Q. Thank you, sir. President Bush, you talked at the summit with Peru's leader about the downing of a U.S. missionary plane in a joint U.S.-Peru mission. Your administration has not clarified the U.S. role in this incident thus far, so I'd like to follow up briefly. How much responsibility do we bear, since it was our spotter plane that identified the missionaries' aircraft for Peru's Air Force to pursue?
President Bush. First, the incident that took place in Peru is a terrible tragedy. And our hearts go out to the families who have been affected. Secondly, I did speak to the Prime Minister of Peru, who expressed his government's sincere condolences.
Our Government is involved with helping and a variety of agencies are involved with helping our friends in South America identify airplanes that might be carrying illegal drugs. These operations have been going on for quite a while. We've suspended such flights until we get to the bottom of the situation, to fully understand all the facts, to understand what went wrong in this terrible tragedy.
Q. What was our role, sir, in the downing?
President Bush. Our role was to—like in other missions, Ron [Ron Fournier, Associated Press]—was to provide information as to tail numbers. Our role is to help countries identify planes that fail to file flight plans. Our role was to simply pass on information. But we'll get to the bottom of the situation. But I want everybody in my country to understand that we weep for the families whose lives have been affected.
Prime Minister Chretien. Next.
Trade Promotion Authority
Q. Good afternoon. I have a question for the President of the United States. Mr. Bush, you're personally committed to the liberalization of this hemisphere, but you don't have a broad-based mandate from the U.S. Congress to negotiate. What can the Governments of Latin America do to help you overcome the opposition of economic groups and of legislators in your country? Thank you.
President Bush. Write your Congressman. [Laughter]
I appreciate that so very much. That's the very same statement that the President of Uruguay asked. I am confident I will have trade promotion authority by the end of the year, because I think most people in the United States Congress understand that trade is beneficial in our hemisphere. We're going to proceed concurrently with that, parallel to that, with the trade agreement with Chile, and we hope to have that concluded by the end of the year.
But I've assured my colleagues that my administration will work to get trade promotion authority. Most Presidents have had what they call fast-track; we now call it trade promotion authority. And I intend to get it myself. It's in our Nation's best interests to have the President have that authority.
In the meantime, as I mentioned to you, my friend the President of Chile and I will instruct our respective and appropriate members of our administration to hammer out, negotiate, and effect a trade agreement between our two countries.
Argentine Financial Crisis
Q. President de la Rua, the question is for President Bush, but I would also like your answer, if you will, Your Excellency. President Bush, the United States Secretary of the Treasury gave direct financial aid to Mexico to overcome the tequila crisis and to stop propagation to the rest of the region. Given the economic financial crisis in Argentina is already spreading to neighboring countries such as Brazil, I'd like to know if the United States plans to give direct financial aid to Argentina, as it did with Mexico in the past?
President Bush. It's too early to make that determination. Having said that, Secretary of the Treasury O'Neill, as well as others in my administration, are watching closely the situation in Argentina. It is in our Nation's interest that the Argentine economy recover. That's obviously in the interest of neighbors that it do so, as well. But we're watching very carefully. We're in touch with your Government on a regular basis, and we'll make the determinations as to either bilateral aid or additional aid through the international financial institutions as the case merits.
Q. President de la Rua.
President Fernando de la Rua of Argentina. The support given by the President of the United States and the Secretary of the Treasury is of great value. And assistance to our country has come through multilateral financial institutions and other countries who have given us international guarantees. So this has insured a fiscal solvency in my country.
There is no risk, in my opinion, of problems in our country—this transitional problem in Argentina extending to neighboring countries. Argentina, with international financial institutions' help, will be meeting the IMF's criteria and is endeavoring in a very determined fashion to reduce the fiscal deficit and to ensure fiscal solvency in every aspect. So there is no risk of any— that we need to be concerned about.
Next.
International Energy Resources
Q. I am from a newspaper in Mexico City, and I have a question addressed to President Bush and to Prime Minister Jean Chretien. Mexico, there is an issue that is of great interest, and I'm referring now to the power issue. I'd like to ask both of you, what is your view for what would be a hemispheric-wide energy plan? What commitments have you already reached, and what would be needed for such a plan to be equitable as between producers and the great consumers of power?
President Bush. Well, first, if Canadian suppliers and Mexican suppliers of energy and electricity are looking for a market, they've found one in the United States. We're short of energy. We need more energy in our country. Much of what will be explored, from the exploration perspective, will depend upon price. The farther away you get from market, the deeper the waters, the higher the price must be. But the price of energy is high enough to spur exploration activities on both sides of our border.
What the United States can do is to provide markets by better pipelines, acrossborder permitting, welcoming supplies of natural gas regardless of the country of origin. We can work with our friends the Mexicans in the south about the development of electricity. I have talked with President Fox about that, not only when I was in Mexico but also earlier this week, and will discuss this very issue with the Prime Minister and the President right after this press conference.
Part of our issue is to make sure our electricity grids are open enough to handle additional power, say, in the western part of our State, obviously the western part of Mexico. There is some very good news in our hemisphere, at least as far as Americans are concerned, and that is that because of technologies, the Canadians have developed vast crude oil resources in what appeared heretofore to be crude oil that could not be recovered from the ground in what they call tar pits—tar sands. And therefore, Canada is going to be the largest exporter of crude oil to the United States. That's good for our national security; it's good for our economy.
There's a lot of work we can do together. It is important for our hemisphere to not only trade liberally but to move energy throughout the hemisphere as needed, and it starts with the cooperation between Mexico, Canada, and the United States.
Prime Minister Chretien. I don't have much to add to that. I think that the market in the United States is a great opportunity for Canada. Already, as the President just said, we are the biggest exporter of oil to United States, and it will increase even more in the years to come. We have a lot of natural gas in Canada at this moment.
I remember, at the time when I was Minister of Energy, we had to sell our oil and gas in Canada to our consumers, to give them a market. Now we have a huge market there, but we have to make sure that the development of these resources will be done in a very effective way, that we have assured market. And we do that, having all the time in mind—we have to do that with the mentality that we have to do these things in protecting the environment. But there is a lot of opportunities, and we'll be discussing that later on this afternoon.
Next.
Colombia
Q. This question is for Mr. Bush. If Mr. Pastrana can react to it, too, and Mr. Chretien, if that's possible. Regarding the declaration backing of the peace process in Colombia, Mr. Bush, would your government be willing to take a more active role and participate in this peace process? And how committed are you to the peace process in Colombia?
President Bush. We have funded Plan Colombia, which is over a billion dollars of U.S. taxpayers' money. That's a very strong commitment. At this summit, we laid out an additional Andean initiative of $880 million, monies not only to go to Colombia but the surrounding countries to Colombia, monies that recognize that not only is interdiction important, but also we need to develop infrastructure. We need to have sustainable crop replacement programs. So our country is committed to the region.
I believe firmly that President Pastrana is a strong leader who is doing everything he can to bring the peace. But it's going to be up to President Pastrana to make the peace. Once he does so, we'll stand by his side. And so our support has been strong, and it's been consistent. And we'll continue to support our friend the democratically elected leader of Colombia.
President Pastrana. Thank you very much for your question. Yes, I think that President Bush has—will resume what has been the help, $1.3 billion, the last year. He talked about a near $1 billion for this next year for what he has been calling the Andean initiative.
More than money, we are asking commerce—that's why we are asking the United States; that's why we were asking Europe. And that's why President Bush is committing in the extension of ATPA and the enhancement of ATPA, to try to get to really some preference that will allow us to get more employment for our people.
I think that President Bush is also very committed in drug addiction. I said yesterday to President Bush that a drug addict is a drug terrorist. One smell of cocaine in the United States is a death in Colombia. So that's why he's also very committed in working and fighting inside the United States. As you will know, the U.S. is expending nearly $20 billion in drug prevention programs. And he's really very committed to bring, also, down consumption in his country.
And I think that we had a meeting in Cartagena, the Andean countries, the ATPA countries: Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia. We invited Venezuela as an observer to the ATPA. And we hope that with the help of President Bush and with the help of the U.S. Congress, we will get the ATPA out before the end of this year. And that will bring us new opportunities for the poorest people of our country.
Prime Minister Chretien. And of Canada, I've assured the President that if they need us to play a certain role, we'll be available. There are some discussions to have certain participation. And if we can be useful, we'll be happy to help.
Free Trade Agreement for Central America
Q. I'm one of the Salvadoran journalists covering this summit. Bush, could you give us details regarding the negotiation of a free trade agreement with Central America? In particularly, Mr. Bush, if you have in mind a date to start the negotiations, if you have in mind a date to sign this agreement, and also if your administration is going to give special treatment to those Central American economies?
President Bush. Trade—I'm sorry, the very end of your question? Special trade——
Q. Free trade agreement with Central America.
President Bush. My first meeting here in Quebec City is with my—actually, not my first meeting—I had a meeting early— how quickly we forget—with our friends from Central America. And we talked about free trade, and we talked about the possibilities of a free trade agreement with a group of nations.
I did not dismiss that notion at all. As a matter of fact, it should be clear to people that as we discuss the agreement that we're discussing here at this summit, that our Nation is willing to work with others, such as Chile, to negotiate bilateral agreements.
And so, I'm openminded is the way to describe that to you. And I think the leaders would tell you that we had a very frank discussion, and it's very possible—it's very possible that we'll be able to come to an agreement with a group of nations that would really make a logical extension from NAFTA. So, to answer your question, I don't have a date specific, but in my mind is the idea of that possibility.
Q. Will you support, Mr. Bush, any kind of special treatment for those Central American economies in this agreement?
President Bush. Well, that's what I was saying. I would be very openminded. As you know, we're committed in your country to helping with natural disasters. It's in our Nation's interest that your good country, with its brilliant young leader, be—help recover. It's going to be hard to have a good economic vitality and growth without the aid necessary to help recover from the natural disaster that took place. But I'm openminded.
Let me just say something on behalf of my Government about el Presidente de El Salvador. He is a breath of fresh air. He is a very bright light, and I've been most impressed by his candor, his leadership, his integrity. He's a great leader for your country.
Q. My question is for Prime Minister Arthur—and before I do, Mr. Arthur, you would be happy to know that westerners aren't doing too bad in Jamaica. Now, on the opening on Friday, you spoke of special considerations for the Caribbean in the FTAA process. There have been concerns about the OECD, IDB membership for some of the small states. Going into the conference, what were the Caribbean community and common market's primary concerns, and are you satisfied that these outcomes address these concerns?
Prime Minister Archer. As I said at the opening, we have committed ourselves to being part of the effort to build a truly inclusive hemispheric community. And one of our basic concerns, obviously, have been to ensure that our framework is in place to accommodate the needs of these smaller, more vulnerable entities within the community.
We are pleased that as a result of the trade ministers' negotiations in Argentina, we shall be embraced by heads of this summit, that there is a realistic framework in place for the completion of the Free Trade Area of the Americas, and that even more satisfying, that there are now clear mandates given to the individual negotiating groups that would enable us to be sure that we will translate the principle of special and differential treatment for smaller or more vulnerable societies into the final agreement that will anchor the Free Trade Area of the Americas.
The Caribbean was also concerned, having participated in the two previous summits, about the adequacy of the arrangements for implementation. I think we would be remiss were we not to say how heartened we have been, ourselves, by the statement of commitments given by the heads of the OAS, the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank—[inaudible]—to support our plan of action with appropriate resources and new institutional arrangements.
But you must believe me when I tell you that for the Caribbean, we are excited by the prospect of translating our human capital advantage into new industry in a new information age. Nothing matters more to us than to be able to leave a conference where there is a commitment to a plan of action to put the new information and communications technology within the reach of the people of the hemisphere, making it possible for us to contemplate a future of specialization as service societies in our new knowledge-based global society.
And for me, certainly, this connectivity agenda that will share the benefits of that new technology to small societies is an exciting opportunity that the Caribbean surely will not miss out on.
Prime Minister Chretien. Thank you very much, Prime Ministers. So this concludes the press conference. There will be another one in a few minutes by the officials of— representative of the regional banks and the World Bank and the political organization of the Americas.
Thank you very much. See you next time."
"May 11, 2001",The President's News Conference,George W. Bush,"George W. Bush, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/212723",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1238,"The President. Good afternoon. First, let me begin by talking about how pleased I am that a budget has been agreed upon. And it's now time for the Congress to act quickly. It's time for the Congress to pass meaningful, real tax reform, and I urge them to do so before Memorial Day. Tax relief will be good for our economy, but tax relief is also a very important way to help deal with high energy prices. And so the Congress needs to act. I'm confident if they have the will to do so, that they can, that they can get this done before Memorial Day.
And secondly, I believe strongly that the Attorney General made the right decision today. Any time we're preparing to carry out the death penalty, we have a solemn obligation to make sure that the case has been handled in full accordance with all the guarantees of our Constitution. The very foundations of our democracy depend on our ability to assure our citizens that in all criminal cases, and especially in the death penalty, defendants have been treated fairly. This decision is going to create some frustration amongst people whose lives were destroyed and turned upsidedown by Mr. McVeigh. But it is very important for our country to make sure that in death penalty cases, people are treated fairly.
I'll be glad to answer some questions, starting with Mr. Fournier [Ron Fournier, Associated Press].
Timothy McVeigh
Q. Mr. President, thank you, sir. Attorney General Ashcroft, on the topic you were just talking about, said, ""There is no doubt in my mind, or anyone's mind, about the death of Timothy McVeigh."" First, as someone who signed 152 death warrants in Texas, do you agree that there is no doubt that McVeigh is guilty? And secondly, did Louis Freeh know about these documents when he tendered his resignation?
The President. Mr. Freeh, Director Freeh never brought this up to me. I found out about this last evening. My conversation with Mr. Freeh, when he came and said he was leaving—the subject never came up.
Secondly, Mr. McVeigh himself has admitted to the crime. Mr. McVeigh, as I recall, said he did it, and I take him for his word.
Q. Mr. President?
The President. Actually, I've been given an order. You're second, Steve [Steve Holland, Reuters].
Gasoline Prices
Q. Mr. President, thank you very much, sir. A lot of families are struggling to pay for gasoline at record prices. What can you do to help them in the short term? Will your energy report address that? And do you agree with your Energy Secretary that OPEC bears some responsibility for these prices?
The President. The price of crude oil has got something to do with the price of gasoline, but not nearly as much as the fact that we haven't built a refinery in years. What this Nation needs to do is to build more refining capacity. And we're prepared to work with the industry to encourage capital development, capital to be deployed to develop more refining capacity. And that may require us to analyze all regulations that discourage development.
But the best way to make sure that people are able to deal with high energy prices is to cut taxes, is to give people more of their own money so they can meet the bills, so they can meet the high energy prices.
I'm not so sure you're it next. Gregory [David Gregory, NBC News]. You're soon.
Q. Mr. President, can I follow up on that point?
The President. Yes.
Q. Your party in the past has argued in favor of either suspending or rolling back the Federal gasoline tax. Will you consider doing either? And secondly, what would you say to American families who may pay as much as $3 at the pump this summer, at the same time that oil companies in this country are experiencing and enjoying record profits?
The President. What I say is, I worry about the fact that hard-working people are paying high prices at the pump. It concerns me a lot. And therefore, the Congress needs to cut taxes as quickly as possible to give people money to be able to deal with this situation.
I also say, we need to build more refining capacity. We need more supply. We need to meet the increasing demands with better supply. I'm optimistic, in the long term, not only will we increase supplies but that our automobiles will become more technologically adept at dealing with the energy situation now. In other words, we'll have new types of automobiles, hybrids. And in the energy plan I'm going to be discussing, you'll see some incentives for hybrid automobiles. But the quickest way to get money in people's pockets to deal with prices is tax relief.
Bill Plante [CBS News].
Q. Mr. President, are you really going to let Republicans in Congress go home for the next recess without some kind of other short-term relief? You know the Democrats are after you and the Vice President, saying you're a couple of former oil men protecting the industry. Would you at least support the Republican bill in the House which would ease some emission standards in California?
The President. Back to David's question, I'll listen to everybody's suggestions. But I want to remind the Members of Congress, both Republican and Democrat, all of us are concerned about high energy prices and prices at the gas pump being too high. Let's get the tax relief done and do it quickly.
I hope there is no intention to delay. There needs to be money in the pockets of our consumers as quickly as possible. We've got the wherewithal to do so. But as to suggestions, I'm open minded for any suggestions somebody may have.
Q. What about that emissions——
The President. I'll look at all options. But the clearest way to get things done quickly is tax relief.
Now, the American people have got to understand that this is a situation that's going to require some long-term planning to get the situation in hand for the—to have a stable future. There is no such thing as immediate supply. This is a situation that's been developing over the years, and it's going to take a while to correct.
The quickest way to help people with their energy bills is tax relief. That is the quickest, surest way to do so.
Q. All options, including the gas tax, sir?
The President. If anybody thinks they've got a good idea, I'll listen. But for certain, what needs to happen is additional refining capacity, as well as tax relief.
Yes, Terry [Terry Moran, ABC News].
Death Penalty
Q. Mr. President, 51 percent of the American people now, according to a recent poll, support a moratorium on executions; and support for the penalty in general has dropped considerably over the past couple years. Does what happened in the McVeigh case, coupled with the more than 75 people now who have been released from death row when evidence of their actual innocence came to light, does all of that lead you to reflect at all on the fairness and the accuracy of the death penalty and the way it's actually administered day to day?
The President. Well, I am pleased to be able to report, as for the first case that came to my desk at the Federal Government, that my administration is going to take its time to make sure that justice has been administered fairly.
Q. But do you reflect at all on the general accuracy and fairness of the death penalty, and the way it actually works day to day?
The President. As Mr. Fournier brought up, I was the Governor of a State that had a death penalty, and as far as I was concerned, I reviewed every case, and I was confident that every person that had been put to death received full rights and was guilty of the crime charged.
Q. So no second thoughts about the death penalty?
The President. Not as far as I'm concerned, so long as the system provides fairness. And today is an example of the system being fair.
Major [Major Garrett, Cable News Network].
Gasoline Prices
Q. Mr. President, on the question of repealing the gas tax, even some Republicans have questioned the leadership and the clarity of voice from this White House about what they should do. I've talked to several Republican leaders who have said the White House has said, ""Look, if you can figure out a way to pass it, we'll say it's okay, but we're not going to propose it."" And what they say is, ""If the White House would say they're for it, it would be easier for us to pass it."" Can you tell the American people right now——
The President. Major, I can tell—let me say it again, see if I can be more clear. To the Congress, who is interested in helping consumers pay high gas prices: Pass the tax relief as quickly as possible. We've set aside $100 billion to help consumers with high energy prices. That's the quickest way to help consumers. I am deeply concerned about consumers. I am deeply concerned about high gas prices. To anybody who wants to figure out how to help the consumers: Pass the tax relief package as quickly as possible.
Jim [Jim Angle, FOX News].
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Q. Mr. President, there are a number of people, including Senator Leahy, who was here today, who are suggesting that there needs to be much tighter oversight of the FBI. Aside from the McVeigh matter, there have been a number of things over the years—the FBI labs, the Hanssen case, and a number of other things. Do you believe it's time for a more sweeping look at what is going on at the FBI?
The President. There are two looks at what's happening in the FBI. One, of course, is the commission that Louis Freeh put together, headed by Judge Webster. I'm confident that that commission will take a full look at the proceedings within the FBI, as to regards to security matters.
And secondly, the Attorney General is going to be conducting an investigation as to why the documents were not given to Mr. McVeigh's lawyers. And I look forward to seeing what those findings reveal.
Yes, ma'am.
Energy Resources
Q. Mr. President, to follow up on energy. You're developing closer relations with Nigeria, Mexico, and Canada. Could you use your leverage with these countries to have them convince Saudi Arabia to open the spigots and provide more fuel?
The President. The reason why we have a problem at the gas pump at this particular moment in history is because we haven't built any refining capacity. When you don't increase supplies of a commodity and demand continues to increase, the price is going to go up. And so our Nation must expand refining capacity. And we've got to do that within our hemisphere. Otherwise, when you transport refined product from far distances, it doesn't meet market tests. So we need more refining capacity.
I am working with Canada and Mexico to increase the supply, particularly of natural gas. We have a serious situation in the State of California, as you're very aware. We've been working with the officials of California to expedite the development of new electric generating capacity. We're also doing our part as a good citizen to reduce demand for electricity in peak hours. But the new plants that are being brought on stream in California are going to be driven by natural gas. And we need more natural gas to make sure there is fuel for those plants. So I am working with Mexico and I am working with Canada to try to figure out ways for us to encourage exploration in our own neighborhood.
I had a good discussion today with the President of Nigeria, who is talking about increasing their amount of production, coming from Nigeria. That is positive news for U.S. consumers. The more supply on the market, the lower—the less pressure there will be on price.
Ron [Ron Hutcheson, Knight Ridder].
National Economy
Q. Given what's going on with energy prices and the difficulties in the economy, can you assure the American people at the start of your term that they'll be better off at the end of it than they are today? And if they're not, should they blame you?
The President. Well, I certainly hope they're better off. There's no question that the minute I got elected, the storm clouds on the horizon were getting nearly directly overhead. In other words, the economic news started to deteriorate.
The truth of the matter is, the market started to adjust March of last year. In other words, the so-called downturn has been in the making for a while. I believe with good policy from the Fed, as well as good fiscal policy, that we can recover, that that robust growth we all hope for will come back. I wish I could tell you when. I'm not an economist, but if I were, I'd probably say there's a 50 percent chance it would happen soon and a 50 percent chance it wouldn't.
Q. And if it doesn't work out, does that mean it's not your fault?
The President. Listen, Presidents, whether things are good or bad, get the credit or blame. I understand that.
But Ron, I'm not really that concerned about standing in polls. I am doing what I think is the right thing to do. And the right thing to do is to have proposed a tax relief package that is an integral part of a fiscal policy that makes sense.
I proposed the plan. I campaigned on the plan. Many of you, the truth be known here, didn't actually think it was going to happen. Now there's a budget in place, $1.25 trillion of tax relief, coupled with 100 billion of immediate stimulus that's now available.
If I had my way, I'd have it in place tomorrow, so that people would have money in their pockets to deal with high energy prices, so people would have money in their pockets to be able to plan for the future. The Congress needs to act. I'm confident that that will help an economic recovery.
Q. Mr. President?
The President. Bob [G. Robert Hillman, Dallas Morning News].
Federal Bureau of Investigation Nomination
Q. Sir, how are the recent controversies in the FBI affecting your search for a new Director? Just what kind of person are you looking to head the FBI?
The President. We've just started, Bob. I look forward to seeing what the Webster report says. I look forward to hearing what the Attorney General says about the—about the reason why Mr. McVeigh's attorneys did not get—did not see certain documents.
And I am looking for somebody who will do a couple of things: One, enforce the law; two, keep morale high at the agency; somebody who is a good manager; and somebody who can work with the Attorney General in my administration.
Q. What's your timetable?
The President. As soon as possible. I'm not sure what that means, though, to be perfectly frank with you. I mean, we're beginning to look at different candidates, and it's a—obviously, it's a process that's going to take a while. Director Freeh assured me that the number two person there could do a good job if we took us a while to find a replacement.
Glen [Glen Johnson, Boston Globe].
Timothy McVeigh
Q. Mr. President, some of those who have interviewed Tim McVeigh say that he will actually revel in what happened today——
The President. Really?
Q. ——that it will be a sign of FBI incompetence. What message should he take from this whole episode, in your mind?
The President. He should say—he's lucky to be in America, is what he ought to say; that this is a country who will bend over backwards to make sure that his constitutional rights are guaranteed; that as opposed to rushing his fate, that the Attorney General, with my strong support, said we better make sure that all guarantees are fulfilled. Mr. McVeigh is lucky to be in a country like this.
It's unfortunate that he would feel like reveling at all after what he supposedly has done. There are a lot of people's lives he affected; there are a lot of people in Oklahoma City—I went to the memorial. I got to see the faces of people, the pictures of people whose lives were lost. I talked to relatives who still weep when they think about a relative. This isn't a time to revel.
Yes, Bruni [Frank Bruni, New York Times].
Q. But to follow up on that, what will those relatives, what will those families of victims gain? What will—how will they benefit from Timothy McVeigh's execution?
The President. Frank, you need to talk to them about that.
Q. In your opinion.
The President. Well, I can't possibly put myself in their stead.
Q. Why is his execution so important and the death penalty so important, then?
The President. Because it needs to send a signal to anybody who thinks what Timothy McVeigh did was okay, that in this society we're not going to tolerate that kind of heinous act.
But you need to talk to the—all I can tell you is, I'm sure there's going to be some frustration by the family members about a decision that the Attorney General made, supported by me. I'm sure there will be, and we'll probably hear from them. But they must understand that we live in a country that protects certain rights. And the Attorney General did the right thing in this decision.
Mike [Mike Allen, Washington Post].
U.S. Citizens Held in China
Q. Mr. President, what is your level of concern about U.S. citizens who remain held in China, and what are you doing for them?
The President. We've sent clear signals to the Chinese that we expect our citizens that have been detained, and/or citizens who have been detained with U.S. relatives, that we expect them to be treated fairly. And we'd like for them to have whatever due process the Chinese can offer. We have expressed our concerns. Sometimes they listen; sometimes they don't.
Our relations with China are relations that are going to be based upon a consistent message with the Chinese: One, we expect there to be trade, and I hope there is trade; but two, that we expect people to be treated fairly inside that country. And hopefully they'll respond.
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Q. Mr. President, is your confidence in the FBI undermined by this episode?
The President. I'm obviously concerned about an incident where documents have been misplaced. But I withhold judgment until I find out the full facts, to find out what the Attorney General's investigation finds out.
Martha [Martha Brant, Newsweek].
American Justice System
Q. Mr. President, following up on that, do you think our American justice system is healthy, or does it need fixing?
The President. I think, by and large, the system is healthy. And I think today proved why it is healthy, that ours is a Government that when found that documents hadn't been given to the defense attorney, even though those documents reviewed by our own—by our—Justice Department lawyers didn't feel like it was going to make the— change the verdict. But we delayed until Mr. McVeigh's attorneys have a chance to look at the documents.
Death Penalty
Q. Mr. President, if I can follow up. You know that those documents could have been discovered days after Timothy McVeigh had been executed. You also know that there is some concern about a forensic scientist in Oklahoma City who was involved in a number of death penalty cases, a number of——
The President. Say that again on the forensic scientist?
Q. ——in Oklahoma City, who was involved in a number of death penalty cases. Those inmates happened to be executed. What can you say to the American people——
The President. Well, in this case——
Q. Let me just finish.
The President. Okay, I'm sorry. I beg your pardon. [Laughter]
Q. Thank you, sir. [Laughter]
What can you say or what can you do as President to ensure that at the Federal, State level, the death penalty is always administered fairly?
The President. Well, at the State level, I encourage Governors to be diligent and to look at all the facts and to make sure that people get full access to the courts and that there is no question about the person's guilt.
At the Federal level, I'm pleased to report that on the first case that came toward my desk, my administration reacted the way it should have, which is, given the fact that documents had been misplaced, the Attorney General recommended the delay of the execution until the—Mr. McVeigh's rights were fully vetted; in other words, his lawyers have a chance to look at those documents. It was the right thing to do.
And you bring up a hypothetical, but that's not the way it happened. The way it happened was that the evidence was brought forth, and we made a decision, and it was the correct decision.
Yes, sir.
Situation in the Middle East
Q. Mr. President, you would not equate the baby that was killed in retaliatory Israeli fire in the Gaza Strip with the 13- and 14-year-old Jewish boys, one of them a U.S. citizen, who were tied up, beaten to death, and mutilated near Tekoa, would you?
The President. I was kind of smiling— it sounded kind of like an editorial.
But the death in the Middle East is abhorrent, and our Nation weeps when people lose their lives. And what we must do is work hard to break the cycle of violence. It's going to be very difficult for us to be able to bring people to the peace table so long as there is violence. And we will continue to work to break the cycle of violence.
Tommy [Thomas M. DeFrank, New York Daily News].
United Nations Human Rights Commission
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Did you speak to Secretary-General Annan this morning about the United Nations vote to kick the U.S. off the Human Rights Commission? And if so, what did you tell him?
The President. I did. I told him it was hard for me to envision a Human Rights Commission without the United States on it—and Sudan being on it, let me put it that way. We're off, and Sudan is on. I'm not so sure—you know, that sent an awfully, awfully strange signal to the world, it seems like to me.
Yes.
Q. A followup. Did you—or do you believe that some U.S. back dues to the United Nations should be withheld as a result of that vote, as some in Congress were asking?
The President. I do not. I think we have made an agreement with the United Nations, an agreement that had been negotiated in good faith, and I think we ought to pay our dues.
Having said that, the decision was an outrageous decision. To me, it undermines the whole credibility of this Commission— to kick the United States off, one of the great bastions of human rights, and allow Sudan to be on. And I think most reasonable people in the world see it that way.
But I did bring up the subject. Thank you for pinning me.
Q. Did he agree?
The President. He listened carefully.
Yes, sir.
Energy Policy
Q. Another energy question, if I may, Mr. President.
The President. Please.
Q. What would you tell an American citizen who is suspicious that your energy policy is going to benefit the oil industry, because of your background and Vice President Cheney's background in the industry?
The President. I would tell the American people I'm going to tell the truth when it comes to energy, that we have a serious problem, that we need to do a couple of things. One, we need to encourage the development of technologies to help us conserve. We need to be more conservation minded in America. But I'm also going to say, as plainly as I can, we won't conserve our way to energy independence. We must also increase supply. It's in the consumer's interests that we do so. The more supply there is, relative to demand, the less the price will be. And I believe that we can have exploration and sound environmental policy go hand in hand.
The only thing I know to do, sir, is to tell the truth the way I see it. And we can play like there's not an energy crisis or hope there's not a problem. There is a problem, and there's a problem that's going to confront this Nation. And my job as the President is to take the problem on and propose the solutions I think necessary to solve the problem. And again, I repeat, it's a combination of good conservation and an increase in supplies. And I believe we can do both. And so—I think most of the American people understand that. Thank you.
Yes.
Japan
Q. Mr. President, Japan's new Prime Minister, Junichiro Koizumi, has accepted your invitation to visit the United States as early as possible. He now enjoys very good support of more than 80 percent, mainly to his strong commitment to economic reforms in Japan.
The President. Yes.
Q. Mr. President, now are you more optimistic about the future of the second largest economy of the world, or are you still very concerned?
The President. Well, I am concerned, but I am optimistic when I read what the Prime Minister has said about reforms. Now, I believe he's a man who is intent upon reforming the system. I had a good visit with him on the telephone. I look forward to meeting him in person. I look forward to discussing ways in which our important friendship can remain strong. And I look forward to hearing from him what he and his government intend to do to reform the system.
Japan is a very important partner of the United States. And it's not only an economic partner, but it's an important partner to keep stability in the Far East. It's important for us to work closely together, and I look forward to meeting him soon. And I'm confident we'll have a very good dialog when I'm able to do so.
Thank you all very much. Have a very good weekend."

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/213671",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-crawford,"Nominations for Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
The President. Be seated, please. For those of you who didn't stand, stay seated. [Laughter]
As President of the United States, I have no more important responsibility than safeguarding the security of our country and our citizens and supporting our friends and allies throughout the world. As Commander in Chief, I have the obligation to make sure America's military is properly trained, equipped, and manned to meet the threats of today, while also preparing to meet the changing threats of tomorrow.
When I took the oath of office and assumed the title of Commander in Chief, our military faced significant challenges. I'm proud to report that, thanks to the leadership of Secretary of Defense Don Rumsfeld and the work of our military and civilian leaders, as well as the cooperation of the United States Congress, we're making progress.
We've increased pay for our service men and women and funded improved military housing and medical benefits. I've asked Congress to provide our military an increase of $39 billion over the original 2001 appropriations. That will be the largest increase in military spending since Ronald Reagan was the Commander in Chief. This money—this is our money our military needs and money our budget allows.
We are not only going to spend more on national defense, we're going to spend it more wisely. Secretary Rumsfeld and our military leaders are in the midst of a comprehensive review of our entire defense structure, from which will come recommendations to accelerate the transformation of America's military.
Transformation is a process, not a onetime event. It's not easy, because it requires balancing two sometimes conflicting priorities: the need to train and maintain our forces to meet all our security responsibilities in the world right now, with the need to research, develop, plan, and deploy new systems and strategies that will allow us to meet our responsibilities in a much different world in years to come. Transformation is important because the decisions we make today, or put off, will shape our Nation's security for decades to come.
I am pleased that my administration has assembled an outstanding national security team. I asked Don Rumsfeld to come to Washington because of his creativity and his experience and because I know he is a results-oriented leader who will get the job done. Don and I will work closely with our new Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, who will serve as my principal military adviser, and who will make sure the military's point of view is always heard in the White House.
The Chairman, together with the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will make sure all our Armed Forces work in a coordinated and effective way. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is also charged with reporting faithfully to the U.S. Congress on the state and needs of our Armed Forces.
In the last several years, our Nation has been ably served by an outstanding military leader and a good man, General Hugh Shelton. He has done a great job as the most senior officer in the world's greatest military. I've appreciated his advice and counsel, and our entire Nation is grateful for his service.
Today I name a new Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, one of the most important appointments a President can make. This appointment is especially so because it comes at a time when we need great leadership. Secretary Rumsfeld and I thought long and hard about this important choice, and we enthusiastically agree that the right man to preserve the best traditions of our Armed Forces, while challenging them to innovate to meet the threats of the future, is General Richard B. Myers.
General Myers is a man of steady resolve and determined leadership. His is a skilled and steady hand. He is someone who understands that the strengths of America's Armed Forces are our people and our technological superiority. And we must invest in both.
I'm also pleased to announce that General Pete Pace, current commander of SOUTHCOM, will serve as Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. General Pace is a proud marine and represents a new generation of leadership and military thinking.
I have spent a substantial amount of time with both these men, and I am convinced they are the right people to lead our military into the future. Times like these, times of rapidly changing technology and everchanging threats, will require tough choices. This team of strong leaders, Don Rumsfeld, General Myers, and General Pace, knows that our Nation must think differently and we will think differently to protect and defend America's values and interests in the world.
To tell you more about our new Chairman and Vice Chairman, it is my pleasure to welcome to Crawford the Secretary of Defense, Don Rumsfeld.
Mr. Secretary.
[At this point, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, Chairman-designate Gen. Richard B. Myers, USAF, and Vice Chairman-designate Gen. Peter Pace, USMC, each made brief remarks.]
The President. Thank you.

United Nations Conference on Racism
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned thinking long and hard about these nominations. I hope to ask you about another long deliberation.
The United Nations Conference on Racism convenes in just one week. Do you want your administration represented there? If so, at what level? And are the Zionism and reparations agenda items absolutely prohibitive to any U.S. participation?
The President. She is referring to a conference that will be taking place in South Africa. We have made it very clear, through Colin Powell's office, that we will have no representative there, so long as they pick on Israel, so long as they continue to say Zionism is racism. If they use the forum as a way to isolate our friend and strong ally, we will not participate.
The Secretary of State is working hard to resolve that issue. We have made it very clear from the get-go—I remember explaining to President Mbeki our position. As I understand, the reparations issue has been solved. At least, the last information I had was that that issue looks like it's been resolved.
But the fundamental question is whether or not Israel will be treated with respect at the conference. And if not, then we will assess prior to the beginning. So I am not exactly sure where we stand at this moment.
I do know what our administration's position is. And the position is, we will not participate in a conference that tries to isolate Israel and denigrates Israel.
Q. Participate at any level?
The President. That's my feeling.
Yes.
Situation in the Middle East
Q. Mr. President, on Israel, as well, following up on that, today the Israelis pushed farther into Palestinian territory, attacking two houses in Hebron. So far the peace talks that were agreed to between Peres and Arafat haven't happened.
I know you say that the U.S. is engaged, but Egyptians, Palestinians are calling for more U.S. involvement. What is it going to take for the U.S. to actually get more involved, take more action in order to help bring about peace in the Middle East?
The President. Well, let's start with this: In order for there to be any peace talks in the Middle East, the first thing that must happen is that both parties must resolve to stop violence. The Israelis have made it very clear that they will not negotiate under terrorist threat. And if Mr. Arafat is interested in having a dialog that could conceivably lead to the Mitchell process, then I strongly urge him to urge the terrorists, the Palestinian terrorists, to stop the suicide bombings, to stop the incursions, to stop the threats.
At the same time, we have worked very closely with Prime Minister Sharon to urge him to show restraint. Terrorism is prevalent now in the Middle East, and the first thing that all parties who are concerned about peace in the Middle East must do is work to stop the terrorist activities.
The Israelis will not negotiate under terrorist threat, simple as that. And if the Palestinians are interested in a dialog, then I strongly urge Mr. Arafat to put 100-percent effort into solving the terrorist activity, into stopping the terrorist activity. And I believe he can do a better job of doing that.
Go ahead.
Q. What's your reaction to the fact that the Israelis are moving into Palestinian territory again?
The President. My reaction is, is that I would hope the Israelis would show restraint on all fronts. And we continue to urge restraint with both parties; we are constantly in dialog.
But it requires two willing participants. People have got to make up their mind this is what they want to have happen in order for the beginning of peace discussions. We've got a framework for a peaceful resolution. It's called the Mitchell plan. And our administration, as has most of the world, embraced the Mitchell plan. But in order to get to Mitchell requires there to be a cessation of terrorist activity. If not a cessation, 100-percent effort to get to a cessation, and we haven't seen that 100percent effort yet.
And if what you're asking is, do we hear the Palestinians call for discussions? Of course we do. But my attitude is, if they are that interested in peaceful dialog, they ought to do everything they can to stop the terrorist activity that has accelerated in recent months. And we will see whether or not the will is there.
Yes. Then David [David Sanger, New York Times], then some of the TV people.
Federal Budget Priorities
Q. How realistic is it for you to expect Congress to move forward with your defense priorities when there is so little money in the budget outside of Social Security? And is it perhaps naive to expect Congress to just roll over and abandon their priorities?
The President. Well, I would hope that a congressional priority is strong national defense. And it will be very interesting to kind of get a feel for the congressional priorities this fall.
And one of the early tests will be to see whether or not the leadership will give us a defense number early in the process. And that's what I've asked Congress to do. I did so in Independence, Missouri. I repeat it today.
And we hear a lot of dialog on the Hill about the importance of national defense. If that's the case, give us a number—at the beginning of the process, not at the end of the process. Let us know what the defense—I think it's realistic to ask Congress to prioritize national defense and education. We've done so. The budget that Mitch Daniels outlined clearly shows that we've got the monies available for a good, strong national defense.
Now, I readily concede, if Congress goes off on a spending spree in other areas, it's going to create a competition for defense dollars. And my point is going to be, to the Members of the United States Congress and their constituents, that national defense ought to be a funding priority, and I expect it to be. I expect it to be in '01, '02, and '03.
Q. So you are using a veto threat as a way of bringing a hard line into——
The President. Wait, wait, you put the word ""veto"" in my mouth. I have said that I will work for fiscal sanity in Washington, DC. And one way for a President to make—effect the fiscal condition of our Government is to express displeasure when certain budgets get busted. And so far we haven't had that, and that's why I praised Senator Byrd and Congressman Young. We've had a couple of supplementals.
And as the Washington watchers will tell you, the supplementals have been restrained. They have been within the budget guidelines, and I appreciate that very much. There has been some fiscal sanity thus far. Hopefully—and I am optimistic there will continue to be some fiscal sanity in Washington. We'll find out.
And there's going to be a battle. There's always a battle over whether defense is getting too much or not enough. Our position is, it has been underfunded, and we expect Congress to respond. And our job, as well, is to present a coherent strategy as to why, why there ought to be more money. And that's what the Secretary is here to discuss with me in Crawford today.
You know, there's a lot of discussion about transformation. Transformation isn't one document. It's not a moment in time. It's a strategy, and it starts with assessing the true threats facing America today and in the future. And then we size our forces depending upon the threats that face the country. And those are the dialogs we're now having.
And one of the jobs of Dick, should he be confirmed, is to make sure the Congress understands why our force size—why we are asking for monies for certain force sizes and how it relates to keeping the national security of the country in the long term, as well as today.
Dave.
Q. Mr. President, to follow up on that, the administration's budget projections show these fairly thin surpluses outside of Social Security for the next several years, and the budget that you've been discussing, of course, does not include missile defense, does not include a number of the conventional weapons, transformations that your team that you've introduced here today is going to be working on.
Would it be reasonable to dip into Social Security and into the Social Security funds to pay for missile defense and to pay for military transformation, or is there any other contingency you can imagine that would make it worthwhile to go into the Social Security funds?
The President. Well, I've said that the only reason we should use Social Security funds is in case of an economic recession or war. Secondly, our budget does call for missile defense expenditures. If I'm not mistaken, I think it's to the tune of $8 billion. And you might recall, as we left town, there were some Members of the United States Congress saying that that was way too much expenditure on a missile defense program, and they would like to divert that money to other programs, some within the defense budget, some outside the defense budget.
And so we do make—we've also increased research and development by a significant amount of money, David. But I think the thing that's important to know is that Secretary Rumsfeld is taking a long look, addressing—assessing all the threats or the perceived threats that could face our country and how we address those threats.
One of the threats that faces America is the threat of blackmail as a result of some rogue nation having a weapon of mass destruction. And that not only is a threat to our own land; it's also a threat to our forward-thinking foreign policy. Take, for example, some nation in the Middle Eastern area developing a weapon of mass destruction and then threatening the United States if we were to move troops into an area to protect an ally.
So, in other words, the ability to have a weapon of mass destruction not only affects our people living in America, because some of these weapons have now got longer ranges than ever anticipated, but also affects our foreign policy. It could be used as an attempt to isolate America, and we're not going to let that happen.
So one of the things you will hear us talk about is the need to develop an effective missile defense system, and we do have money in the budget for that. And there is going to be an interesting dialog over whether it's too much. We're going to stand our ground and say the $8 billion—I believe it's $8 billion, if I'm not mistaken— is the right amount of money.
And you'll see, Dave, as well, as you look at other parts of the defense budget request, particularly the '02 and then the add-on '03, which we haven't laid out yet, there's a lot of money for research and development, which is absolutely necessary. And one of the reasons Dick Myers is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs—nominee— is because he has had a lot of experience in space, for example. It's an area that we need to explore and know more about. He's had a lot of experience when it comes to the leading edge of technology that is becoming more and more prevalent in our military. And our budget reflects the need to fully explore and, at the same time, make sure that today's military can fulfill the missions. And it's a balancing act, and I fully recognize it's one, but our budget does reflect that.
Yeah, John [John King, Cable News Network].
National Economy/Federal Spending
Q. Mr. President, looking ahead to those budget fights down the road, though, in '02 and '03, when you will undoubtedly be asking for more money for missile defense, many question your economic assumptions—more mixed signals today: durable good orders down, home sales up. People question whether your 3.2 percent forecast for growth next year—even many economists who are allied with your administration say they think that's too overly optimistic. On what do you base it?
The President. I think—I'm sorry Mitch Daniels isn't here to lay out all the forecasts that led to our assumption. And we're right in the middle, as I understand. We picked the number that seemed reasonable.
Let's—the facts are, our economy has slowed down. We had an anemic one-percent growth over the last 12 months, and that affected tax revenues. And our administration, instead of wringing our hands, put in place a fiscal stimulus package that was the first real tax cut in a generation. And we believe that's going to have a positive effect on our economy.
No question the economy's slowed down, and therefore Congress must adjust its spending attitudes. The surest way to make sure that the recovery doesn't happen in a meaningful period of time or a reasonable period of time is to overspend.
So my message to the Congress is: I'm proud of your vote for tax relief; it was the right thing to do because it responded to economic circumstances that our Nation now faces. But don't go hog wild. I mean, appropriators appropriate. Don't overspend. And one of my jobs as the President is to make sure we keep fiscal sanity in the budget.
Q. But if you're off by just a point or two, Washington will be billions and billions short.
The President. Well, if I'm off by a point or two, then Congress can adjust their sights. See, I'm glad that Congress finally, for the first time in a long period of time, has said, ""We're not going to spend Social Security, except on emergencies."" That wasn't the case up until this administration. It's a useful part of the dialog, if you believe in fiscal sanity in Washington, DC. It set some important parameters.
So we have the tax relief plan, which is important for fiscal stimulus, coupled with Social Security being off limits except for—except for emergency. That now provides a new kind of a fiscal straitjacket for Congress. And that's good for the taxpayers, and it's incredibly positive news if you're worried about a Federal Government that has been growing at a dramatic pace over the past 8 years, and it has been.
Listen, the '02 budget we submitted has got discretionary spending growing by 6 percent. That's a pretty significant number. Certainly not as much as some of the appropriators would like to see in Washington, DC, but we think it's a nice, balanced number. It's one that will help meet the needs and, at the same time, not overspend and therefore affect economic growth.
Of course, the other side of things is, if the economy gets back to where it was growing, Washington could conceivably be awash in money, and so there's leverage on both sides.
Stem Cell Research
Q. On stem cells, you've said that the 60 stem cell lines can be experimented on. It now turns out they've been mixed in the laboratory with mice cells. Under FDA guidelines, they could have no practical effect. Did you know that when you made this decision, that these possibly couldn't be used?
The President. Here's what I knew. I knew that I sat down with the NIH experts, the people who were—people who are charged by our Federal Government to follow the research opportunities on all fronts, and they feel like the existing stem cell lines are ample to be able to determine whether or not embryonic stem cell research can yield the results necessary to save lives. This is their opinion, and I can think of no better opinion on which to make my—base my judgment.
And so I haven't changed my opinion in the least. As a matter of fact, I read some comments today where the NIH scientists again confirmed that we've got enough existing stem cell lines to do the research necessary to determine whether or not the promise of embryonic stem cells will be met.
Q. Sir, did no one warn you that the animal viruses could invalidate the use of these cells?
The President. The NIH came into the Oval Office, and they looked me right in the eye, and they said, ""We think there is ample stem cell lines to determine whether or not this embryonic stem cell research will work or not."" And I appreciated their candor, and I appreciated their advice.
Root [Jay Root, Fort Worth Star-Telegram], good to see you, my boy.
Weapons Systems
Q. You talked about the need to——
The President. How are you? Used to cover me as Governor. Fine lad, fine lad.
Q. You talked about the need——
The President. Little short on hair but a fine lad. [Laughter]
Q. I am losing some hair.
You talked about the need to maintain technological superiority. Given some of its well-known problems, do you think that a part of that would include the B-22, and do you think that, given some of the budget problems that have been discussed, that it compromises, maybe, your ability to go forward with the B-22, the F-22, and the Joint Strike Fighter?
The President. Root represents Fort Worth.
Secretary Rumsfeld. I never would have guessed.
The President. The Secretary and both the civilians who work with him and the military who works for him are charged with not only assessing the threats that will face us but then are charged with not only designing a force structure to meet those threats, as well as the capital expenditures necessary to meet them.
There is no question that we probably cannot afford every weapons system that is now on—being designed or thought about. And you should ask the Secretary this question, if you care to, because he is going to bring to my desk, in a reasonable period of time, what the Pentagon recommendations are as to what weapons systems should go forward and which should not.
One of the things that happens inside the Pentagon is, people are encouraged to think outside the box, so to speak, and help design systems that could or could not affect security in the long term. And there are many good ideas.
But this administration is going to have to winnow them down. We can't afford every single thing that has been contemplated. And when we make decisions, they will fit into a strategic plan. And we need one. And there is going to be one, and it's coming this fall, starting with—as the Secretary will talk about.
Q. I will take you up on your invitation to ask the Secretary——
The President. You can ask him next. I'm on a roll here. [Laughter]
Q. Good morning, sir.
The President. This will give him a little time to think of the answer.
President's Priorities
Q. You've talked about limits on spending. If your wish came true that the Federal budget is once again awash in money, what would your priorities be? Where would you like to spend——
The President. Education, defense, and making sure the taxpayers had ample money to make choices for themselves. You know, I think one of the things we've got to recognize is that our Government should fund priorities, but we've always got to remember where the money came from.
And I can't tell you how proud I am to be traveling around the country, and people walk up and say, ""Thanks for the $600."" Now, there are some cynics who say $600 doesn't mean anything to a working family in America. That's not what I hear. I hear it means a lot to people.
So if we're awash—and I think our economy has got very strong underpinnings. We're certainly going through a correction, but there are some signs we're improving. Some signs, as John accurately noted, still show that there's an anchor on economic growth. But I believe we'll be back and be robust, and when we are, then we'll deal with the budget.
In the meantime—in the meantime, however, it's important for Congress and the appropriators to realize there's not as much money around Washington as there used to be, and therefore, they need to readjust their sights. And our priorities are going to be educating our children and national defense. Those are our priorities, and I hope a lot of Congress comes with me on that.
Q. Are you implying that another tax cut might be——
The President. No, I'm not implying. I'm saying that if we are awash—I think you were implying we might be awash with money, and I hope we are. I think we've got a very strong economy. Let me say, we've got a strong economic potential. We could have a very strong economy again. I think I am going to get trade promotion authority, which should help. This tax cut will help. Monetary policy should help.
And when we get economic growth going again, after the correction in some of our sectors like the high-tech sector, we may have good money. And if we do, then I want to always remember where it came from. It didn't come because of the genius of the Federal Government; it came because of the genius and hard work of the American people. But let's wait until that happens. Let's just hope it happens soon.
Yes, sir.
Immigration Policy
Q. Mr. President, you said yesterday that you oppose blanket amnesty for illegal immigrants from Mexico. But even if you only grant guestworker status to some illegals, doesn't that amount to rewarding illegal activity, when other immigrants are struggling to come to this country legally?
The President. Colin Powell and John Ashcroft are taking a hard look at our immigration policy. They are not only reviewing our policy in our own working group; they are reviewing the policy with their counterparts in Mexico. And we have had some very good dialogs; it's been a very constructive dialog.
I talked to Vicente Fox about this subject a couple of days ago, and we both agreed that the discussions thus far have been positive. I do not believe in blanket amnesty.
One of the issues you referred to is an important issue, and that is, how do we make sure that as we facilitate willing employer hooking up with willing employee, that we don't penalize those who have been waiting in line legally? And so our deliberations are taking that into account. And that's a far cry, however, from blanket amnesty.
I believe that—strongly believe that if someone is willing to work and someone's looking for a worker and can't find anybody, we ought to facilitate the two hooking up. And so there are ways to make sure that people are rewarded for hard work without affecting those who have been patiently waiting in line for legal status.
Q. Respectfully, sir, can I follow up and say——
The President. Is this a question or a speech?
Mexico-U.S. Relations
Q. Well, how do you respond to those who say you are courting the Hispanic vote with this outreach?
The President. Well, I respond by saying that, first of all, I can't think of anything more important for our foreign policy in our hemisphere than to have good relations with Mexico. Mexico is our neighbor, and we ought to have a neighborhood that is prosperous and peaceful.
The basis for good foreign policy is to make sure your own area, your own neighborhood, is in good shape. And I have got a great relation with the President of Mexico, symbolized by the fact that the first state dinner I'm going to have is with Vicente Fox, and it's going to happen in 2 weeks.
The history of the relationship between Mexico and the United States hasn't always been smooth. I mean, it's been pretty hostile at times. And to me, that didn't inure to our country's benefit.
We've got good relations, and one of the things we've got to do is discuss common problems. We've got problems on our border; we've got problems with drug interdiction; we've got problems with environmental issues on our border; we've got water problems; and we've got immigration problems. And if we're going to have good relations with our neighbor, we ought to deal constructively with the problems, admit there's a problem, and figure out ways to deal with it.
The long-term solution, however, for immigration is for Mexico to be prosperous enough to grow a middle class where people will be able to find work at home. And I remind people all across our country, family values do not stop at the Rio Bravo. There are people in Mexico who have got children who are worried about where they are going to get their next meal from. And they are going to come to the United States if they think they can make money here. That's a simple fact. And they're willing to walk across miles of desert to do work that some Americans won't do. And we've got to respect that, it seems like to me, and treat those people with respect.
Now, I get accused of being political on everything I do. I guess that's just the nature of being the President. And what I try to assure people of is, I deal with problems as I see them. And some people are going to like the solution, and some are not, and we'll just let the chips fall where they may.
I'm going to let Rumsfeld talk to Root. Listen, I've got to go get briefed. Okay, one more. One more. Two more—make them quick.
Representative Gary Condit
Q. You said yesterday that you had no plans to watch the interview last night with Congressman Gary Condit, that you would——
The President. Yes, I followed through on that.
Q. ——but that you would read about it. And I was wondering if you had and if you have any thoughts?
The President. Actually, I haven't read about it yet. I have been briefed on it by Karen Hughes and Condi Rice, who watched it, and you might ask them what their opinion is. [Laughter] I'm trying to get Condi and Karen some national exposure. [Laughter]
Q. Sir, seriously though, if I could follow up,"," this is—you've been reluctant to talk about this issue, and 23.6 million Americans watched this interview last night——
The President. Well, I was one who didn't.
Q. There is enormous interest in it.
The President. There was 270-some million Americans, and I was one of the 250 who didn't watch it. Did you watch it?
Q. I did, indeed.
The President. Okay, good. Do I have— I don't have an opinion yet on it.
I do know that—I hope that the Levy prayers are answered. That's my hope. This isn't about a Congressman or about a network. This is about a family who lost a daughter, and that's what I'm concerned about. I hope that if she is alive, she's returned soon. I pray she's alive. That's where my heart is, and that's where my concerns are on this issue. I'm not worried about the gossip or the Washington whispers. I am worried about a young girl's life, and so should America be worried about a young girl's life.
Q. But sir, do you think the Congressman's evasiveness has——
The President. I have no idea about the Congressman. I am not paying attention to the Congressman. I am paying attention to whether or not this poor girl is—is found. And that's what I'm interested in.
I understand how Washington works, and there's all kinds of stuff that goes on in Washington. People are saying this about somebody, and they're saying that about somebody. It's a town of gossip. And I'm not worried about the gossip. I'm worried about the facts. And there's a girl missing, and our prayers are with her parents. I have seen them on TV. I agonize for the mom and the dad. And that's where my heart is.
Last question, Martha [Martha Brant, Newsweek]. No, next to last. This is the last question, but there's two more answers, mine and Rumsfeld's.
Changing the Tone in Washington, DC
Q. I'll go fast. Thank you, sir.
You've talked a lot about changing the tone in Washington, and you've had some success doing it. But lately there have been some shots across the bow—the Democrats' ad this week on the surplus. I'm wondering if you think that the tone in Washington is changing back to the partisan bickering of the past?
The President. Well, it's not in Crawford. [Laughter] It's a great tone here in Crawford. One of the good things about coming out here is that you get a sense for what people are paying attention to, and they don't really pay attention to partisan squabbling.
The truth of the matter is, I welcome the tax debate. I hope that people try to, you know, attack based upon tax relief for the American people. I think it's—you know, if you want to try to position an issue, it's a nice place to be, because the counterpoint is, what are you going to do, raise them? If you're against tax relief, are you then advocating you're going to raise taxes on the American people, which would be not only an economic—it would be really bad for our economy. But I look forward to hearing the debate, ""Mr. President, I think you're wrong. We should raise taxes on the people, particularly after they just got their $600 check.""
And so I welcome the debate. But out here in Crawford, people aren't that—you know what they're interested in? Their families, whether it's going to rain, interested in the price of fuel, they're worried about insurance rates—they're not too bad in Texas. But that's what they're worried about. They're worried about things. They're not worried about the partisan squabbling that has kind of sullied the Washington scene at times.
And frankly, I haven't seen any of the ads. Of course, I didn't watch the show.
All right. Mr. Secretary, Jay Root asked a very penetrating question. You've forgotten what it is——
Secretary Rumsfeld. I never would have guessed. But I know the answer.
Weapons Systems
Q. You know the answer? I could just be quiet. But let me just ask, on the B-22, is it a viable program, or given its problems, do you think it's just not going to survive?
Secretary Rumsfeld. The issue, with respect to weapons systems, is there are several things that are required by Congress. One is the Presidential budget to be offered in the first part of next year. And there is a process that precedes it in every department to produce that budget that the President then pulls together. The other is a so-called quadrennial defense review, and another is the nuclear posture review. Those are all going on. And through an iterative process with the services, the budget for the 2003 Presidential budget is being built and those kinds of decisions get made.
As the President suggested, we are balancing some risks. There are operational risks with respect to near-term threats. There are also risks of not transforming, of not modernizing the force at a rate that makes sense, or of not taking proper care of the men and women in the Armed Forces, and the risks that you run then of not having the people you need to see that the United States of America can continue to contribute to peace and stability in the world.
So it is that complicated process of balancing those risks that will lead the services to come back with their recommendations, which we then will all consider and take into account in our recommendations to the President.
With respect to the specific aircraft you're talking about, we all know it's been a troubled program. It has had enormous difficulties and—but it has not come to the point of a decision, and it will in the coming period of September and October.
The President. Thank you all very much."

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/216279",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1089,"The President. Good evening. Thank you. Good evening. I would like to report to the American people on the state of our war against terror, and then I'll be happy to take questions from the White House press corps.
One month ago today, innocent citizens from more than 80 nations were attacked and killed, without warning or provocation, in an act that horrified not only every American but every person of every faith and every nation that values human life.
The attack took place on American soil, but it was an attack on the heart and soul of the civilized world. And the world has come together to fight a new and different war, the first, and we hope the only one, of the 21st century, a war against all those who seek to export terror and a war against those governments that support or shelter them.
We've accomplished a great deal in one month. Our staunch friends, Great Britain, our neighbors Canada and Mexico, our NATO Allies, our allies in Asia, Russia, and nations from every continent on the Earth have offered help of one kind or another, from military assistance to intelligence information, to crack down on terrorists' financial networks. This week 56 Islamic nations issued a statement strongly condemning the savage acts of terror and emphasizing that those acts contradict the peaceful teachings of Islam. All is strong and united on the diplomatic front.
The men and women of the United States military are doing their duty with skill and success. We have ruined terrorist training camps, disrupted their communications, weakened the Taliban military, and destroyed most of their air defenses. We're mounting a sustained campaign to drive the terrorists out of their hidden caves and to bring them to justice. All missions are being executed according to plan on the military front.
At the same time, we are showing the compassion of America by delivering food and medicine to the Afghan people, who are, themselves, the victims of a repressive regime.
On the law enforcement front, terrorists are being swept up in an international dragnet. Several hundred have been arrested. Thousands of FBI agents are on the trail of other suspects here and abroad. Working with countries around the world, we have frozen more than $24 million in Al Qaida or Taliban assets.
We are aggressively pursuing the agents of terror around the world, and we are aggressively strengthening our protections here at home. This week we established America's new Office of Homeland Security, directed by former Governor Tom Ridge. Americans tonight can know that while the threat is ongoing, we are taking every possible step to protect our country from danger.
Your Government is doing everything we can to recover from these attacks and to try to prevent others. We're acting to make planes and airports safer, rebuild New York and the Pentagon. We must act to stimulate a slow economy, to help laid-off workers, and we must fund our military.
This is a time of testing—this time of testing has revealed the true character of the American people. We're angry at the evil that was done to us, yet patient and just in our response.
Before September 11th, my administration was planning an initiative called Communities of Character. It was designed to help parents develop good character in our children and to strengthen a spirit of citizenship and service in our communities. The acts of September 11th have prompted that initiative to occur on its own, in ways far greater than I could have ever imagined. We've shown great love for our country and great tolerance and respect for all our countrymen.
I was struck by this, that in many cities, when Christian and Jewish women learned that Muslim women, women of cover, were afraid of going out of their homes alone, that they went shopping with them, that they showed true friendship and support, an act that shows the world the true nature of America.
Our war on terrorism has nothing to do with differences in faith. It has everything to do with people of all faiths coming together to condemn hate and evil and murder and prejudice.
One month after great suffering and sorrow, America is strong and determined and generous. I'm honored to lead such a country, and I know we are ready for the challenges ahead.
And now I welcome your questions.

FBI Warning/Domestic Response
Q. Thank you, sir. You said that the threat is ongoing, and, indeed, the deadly virus of anthrax was found in three Florida people this week. Usama bin Laden's spokesman says storms of planes are yet to be hijacked. Your FBI warned just today that terrorist attacks could be happening again in the next couple of days.
If the FBI knows of a credible threat, can you assure the public that you would take the precaution of locking down any system involved, whether it's buildings, airports, water systems, to prevent more deaths? And most importantly, is there anything you can say to Americans who feel helpless to protect themselves and their families from the next wave of attacks, if there are more to come? What can people do to protect themselves?
The President. Sure. Today the Justice Department did issue a blanket alert. It was in recognition of a general threat we received. This is not the first time the Justice Department have acted like this. I hope it's the last, but given the attitude of the evildoers, it may not be.
I have urged our fellow Americans to go about their lives, to fly on airplanes, to travel, to go to work. But I also want to encourage them by telling them that our Government is on full alert. And that— the alert put out today from the Justice Department was such an action.
Now, if we receive specific intelligence, where we—a credible threat that targets a specific building or city or facility, I can assure you our Government will do everything possible to protect the citizens around and in or near that facility.
And let me give you one example of a specific threat we received. You may remember recently there was a lot of discussion about crop dusters. We received knowledge that perhaps an Al Qaida operative was prepared to use a crop duster to spray a biological weapon or a chemical weapon on American people. And so we responded. We contacted every crop-dust location, airports from which crop dusters leave. We notified crop duster manufacturers to a potential threat. We knew full well that in order for a crop duster to become a weapon of mass destruction would require a retrofitting, and so we talked to machine shops around where crop dusters are located. We took strong and appropriate action. And we will do so any time we receive a credible threat.
Now, the American people have got to go about their business. We cannot let the terrorists achieve the objective of frightening our Nation to the point where we don't—where we don't conduct business, where people don't shop. That's their intention. Their intention was not only to kill and maim and destroy. Their intention was to frighten to the point where our Nation would not act. Their intention was to so frighten our Government that we wouldn't seek justice, that somehow we would cower in the face of their threats and not respond, abroad or at home.
We're both responding abroad and at home. The American people, obviously, if they see something that is suspicious, something out of the norm that looks suspicious, they ought to notify local law authorities. But in the meantime, they ought to take comfort in knowing our Government is doing everything we possibly can.
We've got a Homeland Security Office now running, as I mentioned, headed by Tom Ridge. We're sharing intelligence with our friends in countries from overseas. We follow every lead. And information-sharing between the CIA and the FBI is seamless, so that the reaction to any threat is realtime. But the truth of the matter is, in order to fully defend America, we must defeat the evildoers where they hide. We must round them up, and we must bring them to justice. And that's exactly what we're doing in Afghanistan, the first battle in the war of the 21st century.

Action Against Al Qaida and the Taliban
Q. Thank you. You've been careful to avoid saying how long the military strikes in Afghanistan might take place. But can you promise to say how long American— can you avoid being drawn into a Vietnamlike quagmire in Afghanistan?
The President. We learned some very important lessons in Vietnam. Perhaps the most important lesson that I learned is that you cannot fight a guerrilla war with conventional forces. That's why I've explained to the American people that we're engaged in a different type of war, one obviously that will use conventional forces but one in which we've got to fight on all fronts.
I remember saying to you all that the first shot in the war was when we started cutting off their money, because an Al Qaida organization can't function without money. And we're continuing our efforts to reach out to willing nations to disrupt and seize assets of the Al Qaida organization.
We are in the process of rounding up Al Qaida members around the world. There are Al Qaida organizations in, roughly, 68 countries. And over 200 have now been apprehended. And every time I talk to a world leader, I urge them to continue finding the Al Qaida representatives and bring them to justice.
As far as the use of conventional forces, we've got a clear plan, and it's to say to the host government that you have been given your chance—and by the way, I gave them ample opportunity to turn over Al Qaida. I made it very clear to them, in no uncertain terms, that in order to avoid punishment, they should turn over the parasites that hide in their country. They obviously refused to do so, and now they're paying a price. We are dismantling their military, disrupting their communications, severing their ability to defend themselves. And slowly but surely, we're smoking Al Qaida out of their caves so we can bring them to justice.
People often ask me, how long will this last? This particular battlefront will last as long as it takes to bring Al Qaida to justice. It may happen tomorrow; it may happen a month from now; it may take a year or 2. But we will prevail. And what the American people need to know is what our allies know: I am determined to stay the course. And we must do so. We must do so. We must rid the world of terrorists so our children and grandchildren can grow up in freedom. It is essential. It is now our time to act, and I'm proud to lead a country that understands that.
Nature and Scope of Antiterrorist Action
Q. Mr. President, today Defense Secretary Rumsfeld said that Usama bin Laden was probably still in Afghanistan. How can the U.S. get him, dead or alive, to use words that you've used recently, if we're not entirely sure whether he's in the country? And can we win the war on terrorism if bin Laden is not found?
The President. Ours is a war against terrorism in general. Mr. bin Laden is a— is one of the worst. But as you may remember, we published the 22 Most Wanted. He's one of 22 we're after. In terms of Mr. bin Laden himself, we'll get him running. We'll smoke him out of his cave, and we'll get him eventually.
But success or failure depends not on bin Laden; success or failure depends upon routing out terrorism where it may exist all around the world. He's just one person, a part of a network, and we're slowly, but surely, with determined fashion, routing that network out and bringing it to justice.
We've been active for a month. I intend to be giving you a briefing for as long as I'm the President. I understand this is a unconventional war. It's a different kind of war. It's not the kind of war that we're used to in America. The greatest generation was used to storming beachheads; baby boomers, such as myself, were used to getting caught in a quagmire of Vietnam where politics made decisions more than the military sometimes; generation X was able to watch technology right in front of their TV screens—you know, burrow into concrete bunkers in Iraq and blow them up. This is a different kind of war that requires a different type of approach and a different type of mentality.
And so we're going to slowly but surely tighten the net on terrorists, wherever they live. And it's essential to do so now—it's essential to do so now. The actions my Government takes, in concert with other countries, the actions we take at home to defend ourselves will serve as a go-by for future Presidents, or future Prime Ministers in Britain, for example, or future FBI Directors. It is important that we stay the course, bring these people to justice, to show—and show others how to fight the new wars of the 21st century.
Helen [Helen Thomas, Hearst Newspapers].
Q. Mr. President, on that note, we understand you have advisers who are urging you to go after Iraq, take out Iraq, Syria, and so forth. Do you really think that the American people will tolerate you widening the war beyond Afghanistan? And I have a followup. [Laughter]
The President. Thank you for warning me. [Laughter]
Our focus is on Afghanistan and the terrorist network hiding in Afghanistan, right now. But as well, we're looking for Al Qaida cells around the world. If we find an Al Qaida cell operating, we will urge the host country to bring them to justice, and we're having some progress—we're making progress.
As I mentioned, Helen, this is a long war against terrorist activity. And the doctrine I spelled out to the American people in front of Congress said not only will we seek out and bring to justice individual terrorists who cause harm to people, to murder people; we will also bring to justice the host governments that sponsor them, that house them and feed them.
You mentioned Iraq. There's no question that the leader of Iraq is an evil man. After all, he gassed his own people. We know he's been developing weapons of mass destruction. And I think it's in his advantage to allow inspectors back in his country to make sure that he's conforming to the agreement he made, after he was soundly trounced in the Gulf war. And so we're watching him very carefully. We're watching him carefully.
Your followup, please.
Situation in the Middle East
Q. It's a little offbeat, but—[laughter]——
The President. Okay. Well, I expect an offbeat question, frankly.
Q. ——you've met twice in the White House, since you've been in office, with Prime Minister Sharon. But you have refused to meet with Yasser Arafat. Now that you envision a Palestinian state, will you meet with Arafat and, if so, when?
The President. I want to assure the American people, in particular our allies who are interested in our position in the Middle East, that we're spending a lot of time dealing with the Middle East. I know there was some concern amongst our allies when the September 11th—right after the September 11th attack, that we would forgo any responsibility we have in the Middle East. Secretary of State Powell is doing a great job of staying in contact with both Mr. Arafat and Prime Minister Sharon.
I have met with Prime Minister Sharon, and I've assured him every time we've met that he has no better friend than the United States of America. I also stated the other day that if we ever get into the Mitchell process where we can start discussing a political solution in the Middle East, that I believe there ought to be a Palestinian state, the boundaries of which will be negotiated by the parties, so long as the Palestinian state recognizes the right of Israel to exist and will treat Israel with respect.
Obviously, the events of September 11th have prevented overt diplomacy in the Middle East—not prevented it, it just made it—my calendar is a little crowded. On the other hand, I am very much engaged. I have spoken to Prime Minister Sharon again. And if I am convinced that a meeting with a particular party at this point in time will further the process, I will do so. If it turns out to be an empty photo opportunity that creates expectations that will become dashed, I won't meet.
I hope progress is being made. I was pleased to see that Mr. Arafat is trying to control the radical elements within the Palestinian Authority. And I think the world ought to applaud him for that. I hope he's taking measures necessary to reduce the violence in the Middle East, so that we can get into the Mitchell process.
We're working hard on the topic, Helen. It's a very important part of our foreign policy.
David [David Gregory, NBC News].
Usama bin Laden and Al Qaida
Q. Mr. President, good evening. I'd like to ask you for a more complete portrait of your progress so far. Can you tell the American people, specifically, what is the state of Usama bin Laden? What is the state of the Al Qaida network? Are they on the run? To what extent have you been able to disrupt their activities? Do you believe there are members of those cells still in the United States capable of carrying out terrorist acts? And, again, do you know whether Usama bin Laden is dead or alive?
The President. Yes. Let me start backwards. I don't know if he's dead or alive. I want him brought to justice, however. We are following every possible lead to make sure that any Al Qaida member that could be in the United States is brought to justice. The FBI has got thousands of agents who are following every hint of a possibility of an Al Qaida member in our country. We're chasing down the leads of— that have been given to us as a result of the bombing, and we're following other leads.
Let me say one thing about the FBI that I think people will find interesting. All of us in Government are having to adjust our way of thinking about the new war. The military is going to have to adjust. They've recognized—and Secretary Rumsfeld clearly understands this—that we need to have a—that we need to rethink how we configure our military—there's been some stories to that effect—so that we can more effectively respond to asymmetrical responses from terrorist organizations. The FBI must think differently, and Director Mueller is causing them to do so.
The FBI, as you know, spent a lot of manpower and time chasing spies in a postcold-war era. They were still chasing spies—nothing wrong with that, except we have a new enemy. And now the FBI is rightly directing resources toward homeland security. It's been an adjustment. And I'm proud to report that Director Mueller has adjusted quickly.
I am confident that the Al Qaida organization is moving around Afghanistan. They think they might find safe haven? Not if we think they're there. And we've got them on the run.
The other day we brought to justice a person that killed an American citizen in 1986. He was charged with murder. And I made a point of talking about that in a press conference because I wanted not only terrorists to understand but the American people to understand that we'll be patient, if need be, to bring them to justice. We'll find them.
And he thought his—this is an interesting case in Afghanistan because it's—he thought he had hijacked a country. He actually did for a while. He forced a country to accept his radical thoughts. And it became a safe haven for bin Laden and the Al Qaida organization. It's no longer a safe haven, that's for sure, because of our military activity, David.
Yes, Elisabeth [Elisabeth Bumiller, New York Times].
Ensuring Continuity of Government
Q. Mr. President, you've tried very hard to assure Americans that the country is safe, and yet your own Vice President has spent most of this week in a secure location. Can you explain why that is and also how long that will last?
The President. Sure. I shook hands with the Vice President today in the Oval Office. I welcomed him out of his secure location. [Laughter] There are some times when the Vice President and I will be together, and sometimes we won't be. We take very seriously the notion of the continuity of Government. It's a responsibility we share, to make sure that under situations such as this, when there are possible threats facing our Government, that we separate ourselves, for the sake of continuity of our Government. And I was pleased to see him. He's looking swell. [Laughter]
Jim [Jim Angle, Fox News].
Nature of the Coalition
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Sir, some critics have expressed doubts about trying to get nations that once sponsored terrorism to now cooperate in the effort against terrorism. Would you share your thinking with us, sir, and is it your view that every sinner should get a chance to redeem himself—that there is, in effect, an amnesty for nations that once sponsored terrorism if they will now stop and cooperate with us?
The President. Of course. But our ability to affect host nations harboring terrorists will depend upon our determination, our will, our patience. We are sending a signal to the world, as we speak, that if you harbor a terrorist, there will be a price to pay.
And there are nations in the world that have expressed a desire to help. Helen mentioned Syria. The Syrians have talked to us about how they can help in the war against terrorism. We take that—we take that seriously, and we'll give them an opportunity to do so.
I'm a performance-oriented person. I believe in results. And if you want to join the coalition against terror, we'll welcome you in. I have recognized some countries will do things that others won't do. All I ask is for results. If you say you want to join us to cut off money, show us the money. If you say you want to join us militarily, like Great Britain does, do so—and they have done so in a fashion that should make the people of Great Britain proud. If you're interested in sharing intelligence, share intelligence—all ways.
I appreciate diplomatic talk, but I'm more interested in action and results. I am absolutely determined—absolutely determined—to rout terrorism out where it exists and bring them to justice. We learned a good lesson on September the 11th, that there is evil in this world. I know there's a lot of children in America wondering what took place. I think it's essential that all moms and dads and citizens tell their children we love them and there is love in the world, but also remind them there are evil people.
And it's my duty as the President of the United States to use the resources of this great Nation, a freedom-loving nation, a compassionate nation, a nation that understands values of life, and rout terrorism out where it exists. And we're going to give plenty of nations a chance to do so.
Terry [Terry Moran, ABC News].
FBI Warning
Q. Back to the FBI warning of today, which was based, it said, on certain information that there would be retaliatory attacks over the next several days. Given the complete generality of that warning, what does it really accomplish, aside from scaring people into not doing what you've urged them to do—getting back to their normal lives—what should they do with it, and did you personally approve the issuance of that warning?
The President. I'm aware of the intelligence that caused the warning to be issued, and it was a general threat on America. And as I mentioned earlier, had it been a specific threat, we would have contacted those to whom the threat was directed.
But Terry, I think it is important for the American people to know their Government is on full alert, and that's what that warning showed. We take every threat seriously, and the American people shouldn't be surprised that we're issuing alerts. After all, on our TV screens the other day, we saw the evil one threatening—calling for more destruction and death in America. And so we should take these threats seriously. And we had another threat, a general threat. Had it been specific, we would have dealt with the specifics of the threat.
I think the American people should take comfort in the fact that their Government is doing everything we possibly can do to run down every possible lead and take threats—and we take threats seriously.
I think the American people do understand that after September 11th, that we're facing a different world. And they accept that responsibility. They accept that responsibility.
There is, I think, some positive news about the American people reacting to what we're doing. The load factors on airplanes are increasing. Now, I recognize certain routes have been reduced, but nevertheless, people are getting back on airplanes. That's important that that be the case. Hotels are getting more customers. That's important for the working people of the country.
We are getting back to normal. We're doing so with a new sense of awareness. And the warning that went out today helped heighten that sense of awareness.
John [John Roberts, CBS News].
Afghanistan
Q. Mr. President, you've said on repeated occasions that you're not into nation-building. Yet, it appears in this case, given the politics of the region, it may play a crucial role in resolving this crisis. Prime Minister Blair of Britain has said that the coalition, if the Taliban falls, will work to create a broadly based government. I'm wondering, sir, has that become a priority of your administration now, to devise a plan for a new government in Afghanistan? And what part might King Zahir Shah play in that?
The President. Well, I think it's—John, it's a—first let me reiterate, my focus is bringing Al Qaida to justice and saying to the host Government, you had your chance to deliver. Actually, I will say it again— if you cough him up, and his people, today, that we'll reconsider what we're doing to your country. You still have a second chance. Just bring him in, and bring his leaders and lieutenants and other thugs and criminals with him.
I think we did learn a lesson, however, from—and should learn a lesson from the previous engagement in the Afghan area, that we should not just simply leave after a military objective has been achieved. That's why—and I sent that signal by announcing that we're going to spend $320 million of aid to the Afghan people. That's up from roughly $170 million this year.
I personally think that a—and I appreciate Tony Blair's—and I've discussed this with him—his vision about Afghan after we're successful—Afghanistan after we're successful. One of the things we've got to make sure of is that all parties, all interested parties have an opportunity to be a part of a new government, that we shouldn't play favorites between one group or another within Afghanistan. Secondly, we've got to work for a stable Afghanistan so that her neighbors don't fear terrorist activity again coming out of that country. Third, it would be helpful, of course, to eradicate narcotrafficking out of Afghanistan, as well.
I believe that the United Nations would—could provide the framework necessary to help meet those conditions. It would be a useful function for the United Nations to take over the so-called nationbuilding—I would call it the stabilization of a future government—after our military mission is complete. We'll participate; other countries will participate. I've talked to many countries that are interested in making sure that the post-operations Afghanistan is one that is stable and one that doesn't become yet again a haven for terrorist criminals.
Ken [Ken Walsh, U.S. News & World Report].
Domestic Reaction
Q. Mr. President, I'm sure many Americans are wondering where all this will lead. And you've called upon the country to go back to business and to go back to normal. But you haven't called for any sacrifices from the American people. And I wonder, do you feel that any will be needed? Are you planning to call for any? And do you think that American life will really go back to the way it was on September 10th?
The President. Well, you know, I think the American people are sacrificing now. I think they're waiting in airport lines longer than they've ever had before. I think that—I think there's a certain sacrifice when you lose a piece of your soul. And Americans—listen, I was standing up there at the Pentagon today, and I saw the tears of the families whose lives were lost in the Pentagon. And I said in my talk there that America prays with you. I think there's a sacrifice, there's a certain sense of giving themselves to share their grief with people they'll never, maybe, ever see in their lives.
So America is sacrificing. America—I think the interesting thing that has happened, and this is so sad an incident, but there are some positive things developed— that are developing. One is, I believe that many people are reassessing what's important in life. Moms and dads are not only reassessing their marriage and the importance of their marriage but of the necessity of loving their children like never before. I think that's one of the positives that have come from the evildoers.
The evil ones have sparked an interesting change in America, I think—a compassion in our country that is overflowing. I know their intended act was to destroy us and make us cowards and make us not want to respond. But quite the opposite has happened. Our nation is united. We are strong. We're compassionate; neighbors care about neighbors.
The story I talked about earlier was one that really touched my heart, about women of cover fearing to leave their homes. And there was such an outpouring of compassion for people within our own country, a recognition that the Islamic faith should stand side by side, hand to hand with the Jewish faith and the Christian faith in our great land. It is such a wonderful example.
You know, I'm asked all the time—I'll ask myself a question. [Laughter] How do I respond to—it's an old trick—[laughter]—how do I respond when I see that in some Islamic countries there is vitriolic hatred for America? I'll tell you how I respond: I'm amazed. I'm amazed that there is such misunderstanding of what our country is about, that people would hate us. I am, I am—like most Americans, I just can't believe it, because I know ho","w good we are, and we've got to do a better job of making our case. We've got to do a better job of explaining to the people in the Middle East, for example, that we don't fight a war against Islam or Muslims. We don't hold any religion accountable. We're fighting evil. And these murderers have hijacked a great religion in order to justify their evil deeds. And we cannot let it stand. John [John King, Cable News Network].
Nature of the Coalition/ABM Treaty
Q. Mr. President, you have spoken with great pride of this international coalition. I want to ask you, before the events of September 11th, one of the big questions you faced this fall was, would you violate the Antiballistic Missile Treaty and go ahead with the missile defense plan if Russia did not strike a deal? Will you do that now because Russia's cooperation is so important? And separately but related, are you disappointed that while there have been some statements of support from the Muslim world and the Arab world, that there have not been more vocal and repeated statements agreeing with you that this is a war against terrorism, not Islam?
The President. John, let me start with the latter part. I was heartened by the Organization of Islamic Conference's statement of support for our war against terror. I think that that statement spoke volumes about the attitude of Muslim nations, and I was pleased to see that support.
Some coalition members will feel more comfortable doing certain things than other coalition members will. And my attitude is, and the attitude of my administration is, we'll accept any help that a government is comfortable in giving. And we should not try to force governments to do something that they can't do. Any help is better than no help.
And so, I am so appreciative of the help we're getting in the Middle East. Somebody asked me the other day, was I pleased with the actions of Saudi Arabia. I am; I appreciate the actions of that Government.
In terms of missile defense, I can't wait to visit with my friend Vladimir Putin, in Shanghai, to reiterate once again that the cold war is over, it's done with, and that there are new threats that we face, and no better example of that new threat than the attack on America on September 11th. And I'm going to ask my friend to envision a world in which a terrorist thug and/or a host nation might have the ability to develop—to deliver a weapon of mass destruction via a—via rocket. And wouldn't it be in our nations' advantage to be able to shoot it down? At the very least, it should be in our nations' advantage to determine whether we can shoot it down. And we're restricted from doing that because of an ABM Treaty that was signed during a totally different era.
The case cannot be even—the case is more strong today than it was on September the 10th that the ABM is outmoded, outdated, reflects a different time. And I'm more than—I am more than anxious to continue making my case to them. And we will do what's right in regards to——
Q. [Inaudible]—not agree, would you withdraw this year?
The President. Excuse me, I'm having trouble hearing, John.
Q. If he does not agree with you, would you withdraw from the ABM Treaty this year?
The President. I have told Mr. Putin that the ABM Treaty is outdated, antiquated, and useless. And I hope that he will join us in a new strategic relationship.
One more question, please. Thank you
Domestic Response/America's Fund for Afghan Children
Q. You talk about the general threat toward Americans. You know, the Internet is crowded with all sorts of rumor and gossip and, kind of, urban myths. And people ask us, what is it they're supposed to be on the lookout for? Other than the 22 most wanted terrorists, what are Americans supposed to look for and report to the police or to the FBI?
The President. Well, Ann [Ann Compton, ABC News], you know, if you find a person that you've never seen before getting in a crop duster that doesn't belong to you— [laughter]—report it. [Laughter] If you see suspicious people lurking around petrochemical plants, report it to law enforcement.
I mean, people need to be logical. Now, listen, I want to urge my fellow Americans not to use this as an opportunity to pick on somebody that doesn't look like you or doesn't share your religion. The thing that makes our Nation so strong and that will ultimately defeat terrorist activity is our willingness to tolerate people of different faiths, different opinions, different colors within the fabric of our society.
And so I would urge my fellow Americans, obviously, if they see something suspicious, abnormal, something that looks threatening, report it to local law enforcement.
Let me conclude by one final statement. Thank you all for coming. Before we leave, I want to make a special request to the children of America. I ask you to join in a special effort to help the children of Afghanistan. Their country has been through a great deal of war and suffering. Many children there are starving and are severely malnourished. One in three Afghan children is an orphan. Almost half suffer chronic malnutrition. And we can, and must, help them.
We've created a special relief effort that will be supervised by the Red Cross. We are asking every child in America to earn or give a dollar that will be used to provide food and medical help for the children of Afghanistan. You can send your dollar in an envelope, marked America's Fund for Afghan Children, right here to the White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, DC.
This is an opportunity to help others, while teaching our own children a valuable lesson about service and character. I hope school classes or Boys and Girl Scout troops, other youth organizations will participate in any way to raise the money to send to the children. Wash your car. Do a yard for a neighbor. And I hope the adults will help them, as well.
Ultimately, one of the best weapons, one of the truest weapons that we have against terrorism is to show the world the true strength of character and kindness of the American people. Americans are united in this fight against terrorism. We're also united in our concern for the innocent people of Afghanistan. Winter is coming, and by acting today we can help the children survive.
Thank you for your questions. May God bless America."
"February 21, 2002",The President's News Conference With President Jiang Zemin of China in Beijing,George W. Bush,"George W. Bush, The President's News Conference With President Jiang Zemin of China in Beijing Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/212726",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-jiang-zemin-china-beijing-0,"President Jiang. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by extending on behalf of the Chinese Government and people a warm welcome to President Bush.
This is my second meeting with the President. Four months ago, we had a successful meeting during the APEC Summit in Shanghai. In our talks today, President Bush and I looked back on the past 30 years of China-U.S. relations and had an in-depth discussion on bilateral ties and the current international situation. We have reached many important common understandings and achieved positive results in many areas.
We have agreed that under the current complex and volatile international situation, China and the United States, both with significant influence in the world, should step up dialog and cooperation, properly handle their differences, and work together to move the constructive and cooperative relations between us further forward.
We have agreed to intensify high-level strategic dialog, as well as contacts between various agencies at all levels, with a view to increasing mutual understanding and trust. I have accepted with pleasure and appreciation President Bush's invitation to visit the United States in October this year, prior to the APEC meeting in Mexico. At the invitation of Vice President Cheney, Vice President Hu Jintao will visit the United States in the near future.
We have agreed to vigorously carry out bilateral exchanges and cooperation in such areas as economy and trade, energy, science and technology, environmental protection, the prevention of HIV/AIDS, and law enforcement, conduct strategic dialog on regional economic and financial matters, and hold within the year meetings of the Joint Economic Commission, Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade, and Joint Commission on Science and Technology.
President Bush and I have also had an in-depth discussion on the international fight against terrorism. We have agreed to step up consultation and cooperation on the basis of reciprocity and mutual benefit and to beef up the bilateral mid- and long-term mechanism for counterterrorism exchanges and cooperation. The two sides have also exchanged views on a series of major international and regional issues, and decided to enhance communication and coordination.
To properly handle the Taiwan question is vital to stability and growth of China-U.S. relations. In my meeting with President Bush, I have elaborated the Chinese Government's basic position of peaceful reunification and ""one country, two systems"" for the solution of the Taiwan question. And President Bush emphasized that the United States upholds the ""one China"" policy and will abide by the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques.
Given the differences in the national condition of the two countries, it is natural for China and the United States to disagree on some issues, which President Bush and I have discussed with candor. So long as the two sides act in a spirit of mutual respect, equality, and seeking common ground while shelving differences, we will be able to gradually narrow our differences, enhance our mutual understanding, and advance our cooperation.
It is my hope and conviction that today's meeting will have a positive impact on improvement and growth of China-U.S. relations.
Thank you. It is your turn now, Mr. President. [Laughter]
President Bush. Well, thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate so very much your hospitality. We have just concluded some very candid and positive talks. It is true that I invited the President to the United States next fall. It's true he accepted.
This is the 30th year—30th anniversary of President Nixon's first visit to China, the beginning of 30 years of growth in the U.S.-China relationship. Our ties are mature, respectful, and important to both our nations and to the world.
We discussed a lot of issues, starting with terrorism. We recognize that terrorism is a threat to both our countries, and I welcome China's cooperation in our war against terror. I encourage China to continue to be a force for peace among its neighbors on the Korean Peninsula, in Southeast Asia, and in South Asia.
China, as a full member of the WTO, will now be a full partner in the global trading system and will have the right and responsibility to fashion and enforce the rules of open trade. My Government hopes that China will strongly oppose the proliferation of missiles and other deadly technologies. President Jiang and I agreed that the United States and China could cooperate more closely to defeat HIV/AIDS.
Our talks were candid, and that's very positive. The United States shares interests with China, but we also have some disagreements. We believe that we can discuss our differences with mutual understanding and respect.
As the President mentioned, we talked about Taiwan. The position of my Government has not changed over the years. We believe in the peaceful settlement of this issue. We will urge there be no provocation. The United States will continue to support the Taiwan Relations Act.
China's future is for the Chinese people to decide. Yet no nation is exempt from the demands of human dignity. All the world's people, including the people of China, should be free to choose how they live, how they worship, and how they work. Dramatic changes have occurred in China in the last 30 years, and I believe equally dramatic changes lie ahead. These will have a profound impact not only on China itself but on the entire family of nations. And the United States will be a steady partner in China's historic transition toward greater prosperity and greater freedom.
Thank you, Mr. President.
National Missile Defense
Q. Thank you, Mr. President, for your hospitality.
President Bush, on the question of strategic nuclear policy, you've said you want to develop a missile defense system in order to defend the United States and its allies from the threats and dangers of the 21st century. Do you envision circumstances where that includes Taiwan?
And President Jiang, if I may, with respect, could you explain to Americans who may not understand your reasoning why your Government restricts the practice of religious faith, in particular, why your Government has imprisoned more than 50 bishops of the Roman Catholic Church?
President Bush. I did bring up the subject of missile defenses in the broad context of protecting ourselves and our friends and allies against a launch by a threatening nation. I explained to the President that we've just recently gotten out from underneath the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and are beginning to explore the full options as to whether or not a system will work. And that's the extent of our conversation.
China-U.S. Relations
Q. Just now, President Bush mentioned that today marks the 30th anniversary of the first visit to China by President Bush. In few days' time, the 28th of this month will mark the 30th anniversary of the release of the Shanghai Communique. So my question to President Jiang is, how would you characterize the relationship over the past 30 years?
President Jiang. We will have in February the 30th anniversary of the first visit to China by President Nixon and the release of the Shanghai Communique. The visit by President Bush coincides with this day, and his visit is highly meaningful. Thirty years ago, leaders of China and the United States acted together to put an end to mutual estrangement and open the gate for exchanges and cooperation between the two countries.
History has proven that it was with great vision that our leaders took this major move. The growth of bilateral ties over the years has brought tangible benefits to the two peoples and played an important role in safeguarding peace in the Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole.
At present, despite profound changes in the international situation, China and United States have more rather than less shared interests and more rather than less common responsibility for world peace. The importance of the relationship has increased rather than decreased. So to build a constructive and cooperative relationship serves the desire of not only the people of the two countries but also of the people throughout the world.
The Chinese side is ready to join the U.S. side in reflecting on the past and looking to the future, increasing exchanges and cooperation and enhancing understanding and trust. I'm deeply convinced that so long as the two sides bear in mind the larger picture, take a long-term perspective, and abide by the principles in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, the relationship will make even bigger strides forward in the years ahead.
Thank you.
North Korea/China's Role in the Coalition
Q. Thank you. President Jiang, do you agree with President Bush that there should be a regime change in Iraq? And if so, would you support the use of all necessary means to accomplish that? And with respect, sir, we're eager to hear the response to the original question about the arrest of Catholic bishops in your country and attention to religious groups in general.
And President Bush, you have thanked the Chinese for their cooperation in the antiterror campaign. As that campaign evolves, can you say today what would be the single most important contribution that China could make? And did you receive any assurance today that that will happen?
President Bush. Let me start. We discussed the Korean Peninsula, and I told the President that I was deeply concerned about a regime that is not transparent and that starves its people. I also—he reminded me that he had a conversation with Kim Chong-il last fall, urging Kim Chong-il to take up Kim Dae-jung's offer for discussion. That was constructive leadership.
I then told him that the offer I made yesterday in Seoul was a real offer and that we would be willing to meet with a North Korean regime. And I asked his help in conveying that message to Kim Chong-il, if he so chooses. If he speaks to the leader of North Korea, he can assure him that I am sincere in my desire to have our folks meet.
My point is that not every theater in the war against terror need be resolved with force. Some theaters can be resolved through diplomacy and dialog. And the Chinese Government can be very helpful.
Furthermore, in the first theater in the war against terror, part of the call for our coalition is to make sure that Afghanistan becomes a self-supporting, peaceful nation. And the Chinese Government is supportive of the aid efforts, to make sure that we aid the new post-Taliban Afghani Government in its opportunities to develop its own army, as well as its own economy, its own security. And so they've been helpful there, as well.
Thank you.
China's Economic Development/Catholic Bishops in China/Korean Peninsula/Iraq
Q. I have got a two-part question. First, in recent years, China has enjoyed rapid economic growth, and its national strength has increased. Some people in the United States have concluded that because of this, China has posed a potential threat to the United States, and they call for a policy of containment against China. What's your comment, President Jiang?
And secondly, in your opening remarks, President Jiang, you mentioned that the key to steady growth of Sino-U.S. relationship is the proper handling of the question of Taiwan. President Bush, in his opening remarks, also elaborated on the U.S. position on Taiwan. President Jiang, could you comment on what President Bush has said on the question of Taiwan?
President Jiang. We're living in a world of diversity. As two major countries with different national conditions, China and the U.S. have, indeed, had certain disagreements. But they also share broad and important common interests. So the old mindsets which views the relationship between countries as either of alliance or confrontation, ought to be abandoned, and a new security concept which features security through mutual trust and cooperation through mutual benefit should be established.
It's true that since the inception of reform and opening-up program, China's national strength and people's living standards have somewhat improved in recent years. Yet, compared with the developed countries, our economic and cultural developments remains quite backwards. With a population of over 1.2 billion, the road ahead is still very long before we can basically complete modernization and deliver a better life to all our people. To focus on economic development and improvements of people's livelihoods is our long-term central task.
What China wants most is a peaceful and tranquil international environment with long-term stability, to not do unto others what you would not like others to do unto you. Even if China becomes more developed in the future, it will not go for bullying or threatening other countries. Facts have proven already and will continue to prove that China is a staunch force dedicated to the maintenance of peace in the region and the world at large.
Now, let me comment on the questions posed to me by the American correspondents as they raised questions for President Bush. President Bush, he has much more experience than I. [Laughter] I will do my best to answer your question.
In the first question, the correspondent mentioned that some of the Catholic Church people have been detained. I want to explain that since the founding of People's Republic of China, all our constitutions, various versions, have provided for the freedom of religious belief. In China there are many religions which include Buddhism, Catholicism, Protestantism, Islam, and a typical Chinese religion, Taoism. And their religious faiths are protected by our Constitution.
I don't have religious faith. Yet this does not prevent me from having an interest in religion. I've read the Bible. I've also read the Koran, as well as the Scriptures of Buddhism. I often have meetings with the religious leaders in this country. For instance, when we are about the celebrate the new year or during the holiday season, I would have meetings with them and exchange views.
Whatever religion people believe in, they have to abide by the law. So some of the lawbreakers have been detained because of their violation of law, not because of their religious belief. Although I'm the President of this country, I have no right interfering in the judicial affairs, because of judicial independence.
You also asked about the Korean Peninsula issue. President Bush has also commented on this. In our talks just now, the two of us exchanged views on the Korean Peninsula. I want to make clear that we have all along pursued such a position. That is, we want the Korean Peninsula to have peace and stability. We hope that the problems between DPRK and ROK can be resolved through dialog. And we also sincerely hope that the contacts between the United States and DPRK will be resumed.
All in all, in handling state-to-state relations, it is important to resolve the problems through peaceful means, in a spirit of equality, and through consultation. And that's why I've explained our consistent and clear-cut position on the question of Korean Peninsula. It's quite near.
You asked about Iraq. Iraq is not as near. But I think, as I made clear in my discussion with President Bush just now, the important thing is that peace is to be valued most.
With regard to counterterrorism, our position has not changed from the position I made clear to President Bush when we last met 4 months ago. And that is, China is firmly opposed to international terrorism of all forms.
I'm very pleased to see that Afghanistan has now embarked on a road of peaceful reconstruction. I wish them well. I hope they will succeed in rebuilding their country and enjoying national unity and peace.
Let me conclude by quoting a Chinese proverb: ""More haste, less speed."" Despite the fact that sometimes you will have problems that cry out for immediate solution, yet patience is sometime also necessary. Or perhaps I could quote another Chinese old saying to describe the situation: ""One cannot expect to dig a well with one spade."" So we need to make continuous our unlimiting efforts to fight terrorism.
Thank you."
"March 05, 2002",The President's News Conference With President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt,George W. Bush,"George W. Bush, The President's News Conference With President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/213198",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-hosni-mubarak-egypt-3,"President Bush It's my honor to welcome President Mubarak to the White House again. The United States has got a close and meaningful relationship with Egypt. The relationship is a cornerstone for our policy in the Middle East. I value my friendship with President Mubarak. I always appreciate our candid conversations. Our nations are united by ties of friendship and a shared commitment to regional stability, economic prosperity, and peace.
Today, the strategic partnership between our countries is more important than ever, as we confront the threat of global terror. And I want to thank the President for his steadfast support in our war against terror. Egypt has been a good friend, and I'm grateful.
We also meet at a moment when the people of both our countries are gravely concerned about escalating violence in the Middle East. Each day brings fresh reports of more lives lost and more Palestinian and Israeli families shattered by those losses. Both our countries view this situation with great alarm. We both feel deep sympathy for the people in the region who are trying to live their lives in peace, and we're both determined to redouble our efforts to work for peace.
We talked extensively today about our efforts. President Mubarak has a long history of advancing peace and stability in the Middle East. My country has set forth a goal, which I stated last November at the United Nations: We're committed to two states, Israel and Palestine, living peacefully together within secure and recognized borders, as called for by the Security Council resolutions of the United Nations.
The United States also believes that this goal is only possible if there is a maximum effort to end violence throughout the region, starting with the Palestinian efforts to stop attacks against Israelis.
We want to work with the parties to implement the Tenet security plan and then the Mitchell recommendations. We stand ready to return General Zinni to the region when appropriate. The Israeli-Palestinian situation will be an important topic of Vice President Cheney's upcoming visit to the region. And we're willing to work with all our friends in the region to see how we can build on the vision for peace recently advanced by Crown Prince Abdullah.
President Mubarak and I also spoke about the full range of interests that our nations share. We welcomed the decision yesterday by Secretary Powell and the Foreign Minister of Egypt to initiate a U.S.-Egyptian strategic dialog to provide regular coordination on political, economic, and military issues.
We also discussed how important it is to expand economic opportunities in the Middle East and help more young people acquire the education and technical expertise they need to embrace opportunities as they arise. I've asked Secretary Powellto launch a new initiative aimed at increasing both economic and educational opportunities throughout the region.
Egypt was the first Arab state to stretch out its hand for peace in the Middle East, and it has worked hard to preserve its peace with Israel, even during difficult times. I know that Egypt will continue to be a vital partner as we seek to help the parties move forward in the months to come toward a broader Middle Eastern peace.
I want to thank President Mubarak for coming back to Washington, and now it's my honor to welcome him to the podium.
Mr. President.
President Mubarak. Thank you. Thank you, sir.
Good evening. Before commenting on my discussions with President Bush, I want to reiterate my personal condolences and those of the Egyptian people to you, Mr. President, and to the American people and all those who suffered in the tragic events of September 11th. Let me seize this occasion to reaffirm that Egypt has always been on the forefront of fighting terrorists and will continue to play an instrumental role in this regard.
Once again, I met with my friend President Bush and exchanged views with him on several issues of common concern. As usual, our discussions were very friendly. As President Bush just said, we have built a solid partnership that is serving our bilateral interests and the cause of peace and stability in the Middle East. The partnership has matured over the years and endured the test of time. A general sense of continued cooperation and friendship has evolved.
As you know, Egypt took many pioneering steps toward peace in the Middle East. Today, we remain committed to that goal. Our partnership has an indispensable role to play in helping the parties directly involved in the conflict find a just and comprehensive solution.
In this vein, the U.S. has contributed greatly to this cause for the past 25 years. I welcome that the administration will spare no effort in order to help achieve a comprehensive peace. In this context, we look forward to welcoming Vice President Cheney to the area soon and appreciate that the peace process will be one of the issues to be given the merit it deserves.
We must bring about an end to the cycle of violence and other hostile actions and ensure the early resumption of peace negotiations. Nothing can be achieved through violence or resolved through force.
As the Palestinians are being asked to exert more effort to bring down the level of violence, the Israeli Government should understand that the use of military power and unilateral measures against the Palestinian population, the closure of roads, the siege of towns and villages, the demolition of houses, the collective punishment that make progress more difficult, should stop.
The only way out is to put a decisive end to all this suffering, to resume full-fledged peace negotiations immediately, including the implementation of the Tenet plan and the Mitchell recommendations. Peace will only be achieved through ending the Israeli occupation of all territories occupied since June 1967, implementing the relevant U.N. resolutions, establishing of a viable Palestinian state, and guaranteeing the security of all parts in peaceful coexistence.
For decades, Egypt has been at the forefront of peacemaking and development in our region. Our partnership with the U.S. has played a crucial role in this process. Our comprehensive reform program is now entering a new phase, one that seeks to complete Egypt's integration into the world economy.
At the core of this vision is our quest to deepen our trade ties with all partners, especially the United States. In this context, we have discussed our bilateral relations with a view to intensifying our cooperation in various fields. We agreed to take concrete steps in that direction.
Thank you.
Q. Mr. President, what——
President Bush. Hold up a second. Please, please, please. I'm going to call on two U.S. reporters; the President will call on two Egyptian reporters. We'll be glad to answer four questions.
I will start by asking AP writer Barry Schweid.
Middle East Peace Initiatives
Q. Thank you. Mr. President, you spoke today, as Secretary Powell has, favorably of the Saudi initiative. Israelis are virtually lining up—Israeli officials—wanting to go to Saudi Arabia to talk about this proposal. But the Saudis apparently are discouraging that. Do you think there should be some preliminary discussions, preliminary searching out of what the proposal means? And does it carry any solid hope, as far as you're concerned, of ending this morass?
President Bush. First of all, I think the Crown Prince's suggestion was a very positive development, and I appreciate those in Israel who are trying to find out exactly what it means.
There has got to be a vision for peace in order for us to head toward peace. And the President of Egypt has talked—made an offer for dialog that will help lead to a peace, hopefully. Crown Prince Abdullah has as well. And our Government supports efforts to create—lay out a vision for a more peaceful tomorrow.
And so I appreciate the efforts of both leaders, and I applaud those efforts of those willing to explore opportunity. But I want to remind everybody that it's going to be difficult to achieve any kind of peace so long as there is a cycle of violence. And one of the things that we talked about is how best we can come together to break the cycle of violence.
There are people in the Middle East that do not want peace. There are people who want to use death to prevent there to be peace discussions. They want to murder innocent lives. I cannot tell you how it breaks my heart to see the weeping moms and those who have lost life, because somebody is preventing peace from—somebody wants to prevent a peace process from beginning.
And so, as the President mentioned, the step is to reduce the cycle of violence and to get into the Tenet security plan as quickly as possible. But I applaud the efforts of these leaders for trying to move the process forward.
Q. I would like the question of both President Mubarak and President Bush. President Bush——
President Bush. It's the old two-question trick. [Laughter]
Q. President Bush, now President Mubarak has offered a window of hope, the offer of President Mubarak to host both Prime Minister Sharon and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in Sharm el-Sheikh or in Egypt. So what is your response to that offer? Particularly, what can the U.S. do in order to translate that offer, that is likely to break the cycle of violence, into a reality?
And President Mubarak, whether you were satisfied from what you heard from President Bush in your discussions regarding your offer? Thank you.
President Bush. Well, thank you for that question. Let me say, as I mentioned, that I appreciate any efforts, any ideas that will lay out a vision for a peaceful resolution. And the President's offer was a meaningful offer, and we applaud his efforts. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, Egypt has had a—has led the way toward leading the region toward peace, and his offer was indicative of that type of leadership. Crown Prince Abdullah has laid out an interesting idea. I, myself, at the U.N., talked about a solution.
The key, however, for us to get to the solution is to bust this cycle of violence. And that is where my administration—and, I know, the President as well—is spending a lot of time and efforts to convince the parties that violence will only lead to heartbreak and will enhance the chances for those who hate the idea of peace to prevail. And those of us who love peace must continue to, as I said, redouble our efforts, which we will.
Mr. President.
President Mubarak. I'm satisfied with my discussion with President Bush about the peace process. And we hope we could continue, and the other partners should comply with what we are mentioning.
Something concerning the Crown Prince Abdullah initiative, I would like to say this is the first time in the history of the Saudis that they could say, ""We are ready to normalize relations with Israel in case of peace prevails""—the first time in history. We should underline this. Thank you.
Action on Steel Imports
Q. Mr. President, many U.S. allies are threatening retaliation over your steel decision. Are you prepared for a trade war? And why shouldn't this be seen as a tax increase?
President Bush. Steve [Steve Holland, Reuters], we're a free trading nation, and in order to remain a free trading nation, we must enforce law. And that's exactly what I did. I decided that imports were severely affecting our industry, an important industry—had a negative impact—and therefore, provide temporary relief so that the industry could restructure itself. That's exactly what the World Trade Organization allows for. The International Trade Commission made this recommendation.
As you know, I honored our NAFTA agreements by exempting Canada and Mexico. I also—we will honor our agreements with developing nations. This is a remedy allowed under the WTO. It also is a part of our law, and I intend to enforce our laws.
International Terrorism
Q. My question is addressed for Mr. President Bush and Mr. President Mubarak. As we know, this is your first meeting after 11 September attacks, and Egypt's experience in combating terrorism is worldwide recognized. Did you find a common stand in your talks today to combat this international phenomenon?
President Bush. We did. The President reminded me of the fact that he has been fighting terror long before I became the President. He's an old hand at fighting terror. And I assured him that we were strong allies in this effort.
There are some in the world who don't like President Mubarak because of what he stands for, a more open society. He's been a great leader of Egypt, and there are extremists who don't like him. And to the extent that we can help round up those extremists that would do harm to the President or his government or the people of Egypt, we will do so.
It doesn't matter to me where a terrorist tries to hide. We will work with our friends and allies to hunt them down, and I assured the President that my determination is as strong today as it was on September the 11th. This is an important moment in history, where nations must not flinch in the face of murder and terror and people who are willing to take innocent lives, people who hate free societies.
And I am proud of our alliance, and I appreciate his friendship, and I appreciate his steadfast resolve, as well, to rout out terror wherever it exists.
Mr. President.
President Mubarak. Thank you."
"March 13, 2002",The President's News Conference,George W. Bush,"George W. Bush, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/212036",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1102,"The President. Good afternoon. Tomorrow the Senate Judiciary Committee will vote on the nomination of Charles Pickering to serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Judge Pickering is a respected and well-qualified nominee who was unanimously confirmed 12 years ago to the district bench. His nomination deserves a full vote, a vote in a full Senate. I strongly urge his confirmation.
While tomorrow's vote is about one man, a much larger principle is also at stake. Under our Constitution, the President has the right and responsibility to nominate qualified judges, and the legislative branch has the responsibility to vote on them in a fair and timely manner. This process determines the quality of justice in America, and it demands that both the President and Senate act with care and integrity, with wisdom and deep respect for the Constitution. Unfortunately, we are seeing a disturbing pattern where, too often, judicial confirmations are being turned into ideological battles that delay justice and hurt our democracy.
We now face a situation in which a handful of United States Senators on one committee have made it clear that they will block nominees, even highly qualified, well-respected nominees, who do not share the Senators' view of the bench, of the Federal courts. They seek to undermine the nominations of candidates who agree with my philosophy that judges should interpret the law, not try to make law from the bench. And because these Senators fear the outcome of a fair vote in the full Senate, they're using tactics of delay.
As a result, America is facing a vacancy crisis in the Federal judiciary. Working with both Republicans and Democrats, I have nominated 92 highly qualified, highly respected individuals to serve as Federal judges. These are men and women who will respect and follow the law. Yet the Senate has confirmed only 40 of these 92 nominees, and only 7 of the 29 nominees to the circuit courts, the courts of last resort in a vast majority of cases.
This is unacceptable. It is a bad record for the Senate. The Senate has an obligation to provide fair hearings and prompt votes to all nominees, no matter who controls the Senate or who controls the White House. By failing to allow full Senate votes on judicial nominees, a few Senators are standing in the way of justice. This is wrong, and the American people deserve better.
I will now be glad to answer a few questions, starting with Fournier [Ron Fournier, Associated Press].
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. You are Fournier, aren't you?
Q. Yes, sir.
The President. I'm looking at my chart here. [Laughter] Yes.
Nuclear Posture Review
Q. The Pentagon is calling for the development of low-yield nuclear weapons that could be used against China, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Russia, and Syria. Can you explain why the United States is considering this new policy, and how it might figure into the war on terrorism?
The President. I presume you're referring to the nuclear review that was recently in the press. Well, first of all, the nuclear review is not new. It's gone on for previous administrations. Secondly, the reason we have a nuclear arsenal that I hope is modern, upgraded, and can work, is to deter any attack on America. The reason one has a nuclear arsenal is to serve as a deterrence.
Secondly, ours is an administration that's committed to reducing the amount of warheads, and we're in consultations now with the Russians on such a—on this matter. We've both agreed to reduce our warheads down to 1,700 to 2,200. I talked with Sergey Ivanov yesterday, the Minister of Defense from Russia, on this very subject.
I think one of the interesting points that we need to develop and fully explore is how best to verify what's taking place, to make sure that there's confidence in both countries. But I'm committed to reducing the amount of nuclear weaponry and reducing the number of nuclear warheads. I think it's the right policy for America, and I know we can continue to do so and still keep a deterrence.
Q. Why a policy, though, that might go after a country like Libya or Syria?
The President. First of all, we've got all options on the table, because we want to make it very clear to nations that you will not threaten the United States or use weapons of mass destruction against us or our allies or friends.
Steve [Steve Holland, Reuters].
Situation in the Middle East
Q. Do you agree with Kofi Annan that Israel must end the illegal occupation of Palestinian lands? And how is the Israeli offensive going to complicate General Zinni's mission?
The President. Well, first of all, it is important to create conditions for peace in the Middle East. It's important for both sides to work hard to create the conditions of a potential settlement. Now, our Government has provided a security plan that has been agreed to by both the Israelis and the Palestinians, called the Tenet plan. And George Mitchell did good work providing a pathway for a political settlement, once conditions warrant it.
Frankly, it's not helpful, what the Israelis have recently done, in order to create conditions for peace. I understand someone trying to defend themselves and to fight terror. But the recent actions aren't helpful. And so Zinni's job is to go over there and work to get conditions such that we can get into Tenet. And he's got a lot of work to do, but if I didn't think he could make progress, I wouldn't have asked him to go.
During the announcement of the Zinni mission, I said there was—we had a lot of phone conversations with people in the Middle East which led us to believe that there is a chance to create—to get into Tenet or at least create the conditions to get into Tenet. And I've taken that chance, and it's the right course of action at this point, Steve.
Yes, John [John Roberts, CBS News].
Immigration and Naturalization Service
Q. Mr. President, let me look at what happened Monday with the INS visa approvals for Atta and Al-Shehhi and ask the requisite three-part question. Let me ask you, first of all, how high did the hair on the back of your neck rise when you heard about that? How can the American people have any faith in the credibility of the INS in its antiterrorist efforts? And what can you do, both immediately and for the long term, to assure nothing like that ever happens again?
The President. Well, it got my attention this morning when I read about that. I was stunned and not happy. Let me put it another way: I was plenty hot, and I made that clear to people in my administration. I don't know if the Attorney General has acted yet today or not. I haven't seen the wire story, but—he has. He got the message, and so should the INS.
The INS needs to be reformed, and it's one of the reasons why I called for the separation of the paperwork side of the INS from the enforcement side. And obviously, the paperwork side needs a lot of work. It's inexcusable. So we've got to reform the INS, and we've got to push hard to do so. This is an interesting wake-up call for those who run the INS. We are modernizing our system, John, and it needs to be modernized, so we know who's coming in and who's going out and why they're here.
Q. But what does this say, sir, about the credibility of the INS in its antiterrorism efforts?
The President. Well, it says they've got a lot of work to do. It says that the information system is antiquated. And having said that, they are—they got the message, and hopefully, they'll reform as quickly as possible. But yes, it got my attention in a negative way.
Catholic Church
Q. Mr. President, there's a growing crisis in the Catholic Church right now, involving pedophilia. And the crisis is exploding in Boston under the watch of Cardinal Law, who you know. Do you think the archdiocese there is acting swiftly enough to deal with the issue of pedophilia among the ranks of priests?
The President. Well, I know many in the hierarchy of the Catholic Church; I know them to be men of integrity and decency. They're honorable people. I was just with Cardinal Egan today. And I'm confident the church will clean up its business and do the right thing. As to the timing, I haven't, frankly—I'm not exactly aware of the—how fast or how not fast they're moving. I just can tell you I trust the leadership of the church.
Q. Do you think Cardinal Law should resign?
The President. That's up to the church. I know Cardinal Law to be a man of integrity. I respect him a lot.
Iraq
Q. Vice President Cheney is on the road now trying to build support for possible action against Iraq. If you don't get that, down the road you decide you want to take action, would you take action against Iraq unilaterally?
The President. One of the things I've said to our friends is that we will consult, that we will share our views of how to make the world more safe. In regards to Iraq, we're doing just that. Every world leader that comes to see me, I explain our concerns about a nation which is not conforming to agreements that it made in the past, a nation which has gassed her people in the past, a nation which has weapons of mass destruction and apparently is not afraid to use them.
And so one of the—what the Vice President is doing is he's reminding people about this danger and that we need to work in concert to confront this danger. Again, all options are on the table and—but one thing I will not allow is a nation such as Iraq to threaten our very future by developing weapons of mass destruction. They've agreed not to have those weapons. They ought to conform to their agreement, comply with their agreement.
Yes, John [John Cochran, ABC News].
Q. It seems to me—you seem to be saying, yes, you would consult with the allies and others, including in the Mideast, but if you had to, you'd go ahead and take action yourself.
The President. Well, you're answering the question for me. If I can remember the exact words, I'll say it exactly the way I said it before. We are going to consult. I am deeply concerned about Iraq, and so should the American people be concerned about Iraq, and so should people who love freedom be concerned about Iraq.
This is a nation run by a man who is willing to kill his own people by using chemical weapons, a man who won't let inspectors into the country, a man who's obviously got something to hide. And he is a problem, and we're going to deal with him. But the first stage is to consult with our allies and friends, and that's exactly what we're doing.
Everybody here on the front row? John [John Dickerson, Time].
Situation in the Middle East
Q. Mr. President, on the question of Iraq, how does the increased violence between the Israelis and the Palestinians affect what Vice President Cheney is trying to do and affect the case you're trying to make with our Arab allies for a regime change or just unconditional inspections?
The President. Well, I understand that the unrest in the Middle East creates unrest throughout the region, more so now than ever in the past. But we're concerned about the Middle East, John, because it's affecting the lives of the Palestinians and our friends the Israelis. I mean, it's a terrible period of time when a lot of people are losing their lives, needlessly losing life. And terrorists are holding a potential peace process hostage.
And so while I understand the linkage, for us the policy stands on its own. The need for us to be involved in the Middle East is to help save lives. And we're going to stay involved in the Middle East and, at the same time, continue to talk about Iraq and Iran and other nations and continue to wage a war on terror, which is exactly what we're doing.
I want to reiterate what I said the other day. Our policy is to deny sanctuary to terrorists anyplace in the world, and we will be very actively—in doing that.
Q. But on the question of the Palestinians, Sharon has said that he shares your concern for those not involved in terror. Do you still think that's the case?
The President. I do. But unlike our war against Al Qaida, there is a series of agreements in place that will lead to peace. And therefore, we're going to work hard to see if we can't, as they say, get into Tenet and eventually Mitchell. I do—I certainly hope that Prime Minister Sharon is concerned about the loss of innocent life. We certainly—I certainly am. It breaks my heart and I know it breaks the hearts of a lot of people around the world to see young children lose their life as a result of violence, young children on both sides of this issue.
This is an issue that's consuming a lot of the time of my administration. And we have an obligation to continue to work for peace in the region, and we will—we will. The two are not mutually exclusive, however.
Yes.
Scope of the War on Terrorism
Q. Mr. President, in your speeches now you rarely talk or mention Usama bin Laden. Why is that? Also, can you tell the American people if you have any more information, if you know if he is dead or alive? Final part, deep in your heart, don't you truly believe that until you find out if he is dead or alive, you won't really eliminate the threat of——
The President. Well, deep in my heart, I know the man is on the run if he's alive at all. Who knows if he's hiding in some cave or not? We haven't heard from him in a long time. And the idea of focusing on one person is—really indicates to me people don't understand the scope of the mission.
Terror is bigger than one person. And he's just—he's a person who's now been marginalized. His network is—his host government has been destroyed. He's the ultimate parasite who found weakness, exploited it, and met his match. He is—as I've mentioned in my speeches, I do mention the fact that this is a fellow who is willing to commit youngsters to their death, and he himself tries to hide—if, in fact, he's hiding at all.
So I don't know where he is. You know, I just don't spend that much time on him, Kelly [Kelly Wallace, Cable News Network], to be honest with you. I'm more worried about making sure that our soldiers are well supplied, that the strategy is clear, that the coalition is strong, that when we find enemy bunched up like we did in Shahi-Kot Mountains, that the military has all the support it needs to go in and do the job, which they did.
And there will be other battles in Afghanistan. There's going to be other struggles like Shahi-Kot, and I'm just as confident about the outcome of those future battles as I was about Shahi-Kot, where our soldiers are performing brilliantly. We're tough; we're strong; they're well equipped. We have a good strategy. We are showing the world we know how to fight a guerrilla war with conventional means.
Q. But don't you believe that the threat that bin Laden posed won't truly be eliminated until he is found either dead or alive?
The President. Well, as I say, we haven't heard much from him. And I wouldn't necessarily say he's at the center of any command structure. And again, I don't know where he is. I—I'll repeat what I said. I truly am not that concerned about him. I know he is on the run. I was concerned about him when he had taken over a country. I was concerned about the fact that he was basically running Afghanistan and calling the shots for the Taliban.
But once we set out the policy and started executing the plan, he became—we shoved him out more and more on the margins. He has no place to train his Al Qaida killers anymore. And if we—excuse me for a minute—and if we find a training camp, we'll take care of it. Either we will, or our friends will. That's one of the things—part of the new phase that's becoming apparent to the American people is that we're working closely with other governments to deny sanctuary or training or a place to hide or a place to raise money.
And we've got more work to do. See, that's the thing the American people have got to understand, that we've only been at this 6 months. This is going to be a long struggle. I keep saying that; I don't know whether you all believe me or not. But time will show you that it's going to take a long time to achieve this objective. And I can assure you, I am not going to blink, and I'm not going to get tired, because I know what is at stake. And history has called us to action, and I am going to seize this moment for the good of the world, for peace in the world, and for freedom.
Mike Allen [Mike Allen, Washington Post]. I'm working my way back there, slowly but surely. Michael.
Relationship Between Executive and Legislative Branches
Q. Mr. President, a bipartisan group of lawmakers has asked Governor Ridge to testify about the administration's domestic homeland security efforts. Why has the White House said that Governor Ridge will not testify?
The President. Well, he's not—he doesn't have to testify. He's a part of my staff, and that's part of the prerogative of the executive branch of Government, and we hold that very dear.
Q. Mr. President, that's another area, along with the war and the development of the energy policy——
The President. This wasn't a trick question, Mike—get me to say that and then kind of have a quick followup? But go ahead.
Q. No, sir. But that's an area where Congress has said—members of both parties have told us they're not getting enough information from the White House.
The President. Oh, Mike, Mike, Mike, we consult with Congress all the time. I've had meaningful breakfasts with the leadership in the House and the Senate. I break bread with both Republicans and Democrats right back here in the Oval Office and have a good, honest discussion about plans, objectives, what's taking place, what's not taking place. We have members of our Cabinet briefing. Condoleezza Rice is in touch with the Members of the Congress. We are in touch with—we understand the role of the Congress. We must justify budgets to Congress. And so I don't buy that, to be frank with you.
Q. Mr. President, given——
The President. Mike, this is the third. Two followups is a record. Keep trying.
Q. Given that you've not convinced everyone in your own party of that, to what degree are you trying to recalibrate the power between Congress and the Presidency?
The President. Mike, I'm just doing my job. We'll let all the kind of the legal historians figure all that out, you know.
First of all, I'm not going to let Congress erode the power of the executive branch. I have a duty to protect the executive branch from legislative encroachment. I mean, for example, when the GAO demands documents from us, we're not going to give them to them. These were privileged conversations. These were conversations when people come into our offices and brief us. Can you imagine having to give up every single transcript of what is advised me or the Vice President? Our advice wouldn't be good and honest and open.
And so I viewed that as an encroachment on the power of the executive branch. I have an obligation to make sure that the Presidency remains robust and the legislative branch doesn't end up running the executive branch.
On the other hand, there's plenty of consultation, Mike. I don't know what single Republican you're referring to. But if you'd give me the name afterwards, I'll be glad to have him over for another consultation, if you know what I mean. [Laughter]
David [David Sanger, New York Times].
Saudi Peace Initiative
Q. Mr. President, when you endorsed the Saudi plan on the Middle East, or the Saudi vision, it called, of course, for full normalization of relations between Israel and the Arab states. You've seen some backing away from that now by some other Arab countries and, in fact, by the Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia. Can you imagine endorsing a plan that calls for anything other than full normalization, anything less than full normalization?
The President. Well, I think the thing— in order for there to be a plan that is acceptable to all parties, it must recognize the right of Israel to exist. And that's what I thought was very encouraging from the Saudi declaration. It was the first such declaration, if I'm not mistaken, David—you probably know that better than me—but that the Crown Prince said there ought to be a independent state but—that recognizes Israel. That's how I interpreted it— Israel's right to exist. And I think that's a very important declaration. That's why we seized on that. I have said the same thing myself, but it obviously didn't have nearly the same weight as the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia in saying that.
Q. Normalization means something a little deeper than that.
The President. Well, but first of all, there's nothing more deep than recognizing Israel's right to exist. That's the most deep thought of all. After all, there are some skeptics who think that nations in that part of the world don't want Israel to exist. The first and most important qualification, it seems like to me, for there to be peace is for people in the region to recognize Israel's right to exist. And therefore, policies ought to follow along those lines. I can't think of anything more deep than that right, that ultimate and final security.
And when the Crown Prince indicated that was on his mind, we embraced that, strongly embraced that.
Go ahead.
Nature of the War on Terrorism
Q. I was about to say, just a moment ago, you said that many of your allies are joining you in the war on terrorism. You do have a number of countries right now that seem to be right in the middle—Indonesia, Somalia—places that you've been worried about but that have not asked for our training, our help. Would you consider going into a country that did not seek your aid?
The President. Well, that's one of those pretty cleverly worded hypotheticals. Let me just put it to you this way, David: We will take actions necessary to protect American people, and I'm going to leave it at that. That's a good question, however.
Yes.
Russia-U.S. Nuclear Agreements
Q. Mr. President, back to nuclear issues, the Russian Defense Minister expressed the hope today that agreements on the new strategic framework could be signed by the time of your visit next May in Moscow. Is it realistic? And second, are you ready to sign documents in a treaty form? And third, have you made progress on the issue of destroying versus storing nuclear warheads?
The President. Well, I share the Minister's optimism that we can get something done by May. I'd like to sign a document in Russia, when I'm there. I think it would be a good thing. And therefore, we've got to make sure that those who are interested in making sure that the cold war relationship continues on are kind of pushed in the background. In other words, we've got to work hard to establish a new relationship.
I also agree with President Putin that there needs to be a document that outlives both of us. What form that comes in, we will discuss. There is a—I think David asked me this question, as a matter of fact, back in Slovenia, if I'm not mistaken, about storage versus destruction. We'd be glad to talk to the Russians about that. I think the most important thing, though, is verification, is to make sure that whatever decision is made, that there is open verification so as to develop a level of trust.
There is a constraint as well. I mean, the destruction of nuclear warheads requires a lot of work and a lot of detailed work, and that, in itself, is going to take time, and that's got to be a part of the equation as well.
But those are all issues we're discussing. I had a good—very good discussion with Sergey Ivanov yesterday. I'm confident that President Putin is interested in making a deal, coming up with a good arrangement that will codify a new relationship. The more Russia—the more we work with Russia, the better the world will be. And we've got a good, close relationship with them.
We've got a few sticking points. We've got an issue on chickens, for example, that some of you have followed. We made it pretty darn clear to them that I think we've probably got to get this chicken issue resolved and get those chickens moving from the United States into the Russian market. [Laughter] We laugh, but nevertheless it is a problem—that we must honor agreements. But I believe we're going to have great relations with Russia, and we're going to work hard to achieve them.
Yes, go ahead. You're next, Angle [Jim Angle, Fox News].
Debt Ceiling
Q. Mr. President, can I ask about the debt limit, sir? And specifically about the Treasury Secretary's plan to borrow cash from the Federal retirement funds, can you justify that to the American people, sir?
The President. I'm not going to comment on the Secretary of Treasury's plan. I'll tell you what I think ought to happen. I think Congress ought to pass a clean bill that raises the debt ceiling, and I'll sign it. I think it's important. I hope we can get that kind of spirit out of Congress. If they do that, it will solve the problem. We don't need to be playing politics with the debt ceiling, particularly now that we're at war.
And we're working with the Congress on that. I've had some pretty good discussions with the leadership about the need to get a clean bill coming. And I hope they do. I hope they listen; I hope they respond.
Q. There are those who will say that borrowing from the Federal retirement funds is also a form of playing politics——
The President. Well, if the Congress passes the bill, we're fine. And we've got to get that done. It's their responsibility to get the debt ceiling raised. I hope they do it quickly and soon, and we're going to work with them to get it done.
Jim.
Nuclear Posture Review
Q. Mr. President, what do you make of the dust-up over the nuclear review? And have you made any decisions about its recommendations? In particular, what is your view about building smaller nuclear weapons, which some people believe would make them more likely to be used?
The President. Well, first of all, I view our nuclear arsenal as a deterrent, as a way to say to people that would harm America, ""Don't do it."" That's a deterrent, that there's a consequence. And the President must have all options available to make that deterrent have meaning. And that's how I view the review.
Q. But what is your thinking, sir, on smaller nuclear weapons, which some analysts believe would be a major departure and would make them more likely——
The President. My interest is—Jim, my interest is to reduce the threat of a nuclear war, is to reduce the number of nuclear warheads. I think we've got plenty of warheads to keep the peace. I'm interested in—and that's why I told President Putin and told the country, if need be, we'll just reduce unilaterally to a level commensurate * with keeping a deterrence and keeping the peace.
So I'm interested in having all—having an arsenal at my disposal or at the military's disposal that will keep the peace. We're a peaceful nation and moving along just right and just kind of having a time, and all of a sudden, we get attacked, and now we're at war, but we're at war to keep the peace.
And it's very important for people in America to understand that at least my attitude on this is that we're not out to seek revenge. Sure, we're after justice, but I also view this as a really good opportunity to create a lasting peace.
And so, therefore, the more firm we are and the more determined we are to take care of Al Qaida and deal with terrorism in all its forms, particularly that of global reach, that we have a very good chance of solving some difficult problems, including the Middle East or the subcontinent. But it's going to require a resolve and firmness from the United States of America.
One of the things I've learned in my discussions and at least listening to the echo chamber out there in the world is that if the United States were to waver, some in the world would take a nap when it comes to the war on terror. And we're just not going to let them do that. And that's why you hear me spend a lot of time talking to the American people—at least, I hope I'm talking to them, through you— about why this is going to take a long period of time and why I'm so determined to remain firm in my resolve. And—anyway.
Draft Registration/Military Readiness
Q. Mr. President, could I——
The President. Yes, sir? You asked the softest. [Laughter]
Q. I'd like to ask you about the public service component of your initiative as it——
The President. The what, now?
Q. The public service initiative of yours as it relates to the war, which you've just said again, that could go on for quite a while. As we all know, 18-year-old men in this country, when they turn 18, they're required to register with the draft, which is now dormant but could be activated again. At this time—and we're looking at sort of an unlimited situation with this war—should the country expect the same of women in this country?
The President. You mean in terms of the draft?
Q. Yes.
The President. Well, the country shouldn't expect there to be a draft. I know they're registering. But the volunteer army is working. Particularly when Congress passes my budget, it's going to make it more likely to work. There's been a pay raise, and then we'll have another pay raise. And the mission is clear; the training is good; the equipment is going to be robust. Congress needs to pass this budget.
So I don't worry about—and people shouldn't worry about a draft. We do have women in the military, and I'm proud of their service. And they're welcome in the military; they make a great addition to the military.
Q. You don't think——
The President. Pardon me?
Q. ——that the military will be stretched too thinly, as some people have feared?
The President. Ed [Ed Chen, Los Angeles Times], I don't think so. I think we're in pretty good shape right now. It's— there's no question we have obligations around the world, which we will keep. If you went to—did you go to Korea with us?
Q. Yes, sir.
The President. Well, there's a major obligation there of 37,000 troops, an obligation that is an important obligation, one"," that I know is important, and we will keep that obligation. But we've got ample manpower to meet our needs.
Plus, we've got a vast coalition of nations willing to lend their own manpower to the war. And as I mentioned the other day in my speech there on the South Lawn, 17 nations are involved in this first theater in Afghanistan. And we had Canadians and Danish and Germans and Australians—I'm probably going to leave somebody out— Brits, Special Forces troops on the ground, boots on the ground, as they say, willing to risk their lives in a dangerous phase of this war, and men going cave to cave, looking for killers. These people don't like to surrender; they don't surrender. But we've been able to count on foreign troops to help us.
And so, Ed, I think we're in good shape. I really do. And if not, we'll—I'll address the Nation, but I don't see any need to right now.
Mexico-U.S. Relations
Q. Will you take one on Mexico?
The President. Si.
Q. You are going to my country next week.
The President. Es la verdad.
Q. Besides what President Fox presented to you last year, you haven't acted in favor of the Mexican proposal by the President of Mexico. You haven't presented anything to Congress.
The President. Excuse me a second, what proposal are you talking about?
Q. The one the President Fox mentioned——
The President. In specific. I don't mean to interrupt you.
Q. The regularization of——
The President. Oh, the immigration issue?
Q. Yes, the immigration issue. So when are you going to present any concrete steps in that direction for Mexico?
The President. Well, first of all, we are working closely with Mexico. We've had many of our administration officials down there. Tom Ridge just came back; he had a very good dialog with President Fox. John Ashcroft has been very much involved with the Mexican Government. We have had a wide-ranging discussions as to how to make the border work better, how to make the border more secure for both countries. We've had a really good dialog.
Some of what needs to be done didn't require law. I'm glad you brought that up. We just got 245(i) passed in the House of Representatives. Hopefully, that will come out of the Senate quickly. That's a step toward—that's a good reform, is one that I support. I also cautioned President Fox at the time that there will be no blanket amnesty in America. I don't think the will of the American people is for blanket amnesty. I think he understands that.
And so, therefore, the thing we've got to do is figure out how to make sure willing employers are able to match up with willing employees. And so we'll work—we're making progress; 245(i) is good progress.
Yes.
Lieutenant Commander Michael Scott Speicher
Q. Mr. President, do you believe there is an American pilot from the Gulf War still alive in Iraq? And if so, how might that complicate any actions you consider——
The President. Well, let me just say this to you. I know that the man has got an MIA status, and it reminds me once again about the nature of Saddam Hussein if, in fact, he's alive. And therefore, it's just another part of my thinking about him, my—I guess, lack of respect is a good way to define it.
Q. Does it complicate any action you might take—you might consider taking against Iraq in the war against terror?
The President. Well, that's where we're— this is the old hypothetical again. And let me just put it this way: It doesn't change my opinion about him. Matter of fact, it reinforces the fact that anybody who would be so cold and heartless as to hold an American flyer for all this period of time without notification to his family just—I wouldn't put it past him, given the fact that he gassed his own people.
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Yes, ma'am.
Zimbabwe Elections/Nomination of Charles W. Pickering, Sr.
Q. Okay, thank you. Do you officially recognize the Zimbabwe elections? And what are your thoughts about Mugabe? And also on Pickering, what are your thoughts——
The President. Wait, whoa, whoa. [Laughter] Wait a minute. This is all over the lot. [Laughter] Wait a minute—all over the lot.
Q. Mr. President, when I get a chance with you, I have to take it.
The President. You talk about somebody taking the liberty of a——
Q. When I get a chance with you, I have to take it.
The President. I can see that. [Laughter] Go ahead, take it.
Q. Okay.
The President. Is this a six-part question?
Q. No, it's only three.
The President. Three, okay. [Laughter] Let me start writing them down. First one is Zimbabwe. Go ahead.
Q. Yes, and with Pickering——
The President. Pickering——
Q. What are your thoughts about many of your nominees who are opposed have issues with racial bias, including Pickering?
The President. Yes, okay. That's two.
Q. Okay.
The President. You're going to limit it to two? Thank you very much.
Q. Yes, you're welcome.
The President. That's a good break.
First on Pickering, Pickering has got a very strong record on civil rights. Just ask the people he lives with. I had the honor of meeting the attorney general of Mississippi, Moore. Attorney General Moore— fine Democrat, elected statewide in the State of Mississippi; a man who, I suspect, is a man who got elected because he cares deeply about the civil rights of his citizens—came up and sat in the Oval Office and said Judge Pickering has had a fine record on civil rights and should be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. I hope the Senators hear that. I hope they listen to Moore or Al Gore's brother-in-law or the former Governor of Mississippi, Winters.
Zimbabwe. We do not recognize the outcome of the election because we think it's flawed. And we are dealing with—and we are dealing with our friends to figure out how to deal with this flawed election.
Q. What are the options then?
The President. Well, we're dealing with our friends right now to figure out how to deal with it.
Class Action Reform Legislation
Q. The House is voting on class action reform this evening. Given the current political atmosphere, do you want to enact new legal reforms into law this year? And if so, which ones are you going to——
The President. Well, here's the thing. I am for reducing the number of lawsuits in our society. I think everybody will have their day in court, but I think a society that is so kind of litigious-oriented is one that is bad for jobs, bad for the creation of jobs. And if any reform—I will support reforms which reduce lawsuits and at the same time provide—give people the opportunity to take their case to court.
Q. Are there any ones you want to pursue?
The President. Stretch [Richard Keil, Bloomberg News]. Super Stretch, Little Stretch. Regular Stretch. [Laughter]
Corporate Management Reform
Q. Last week you announced an ambitious set of changes to make it easier for the Government to crack down on corporate wrongdoing. Yet Republicans in Congress and your own SEC Chairman says, essentially, a lot more money than you proposed will be needed to do the job effectively. I'm talking about the——
The President. You're talking about when I called on the SEC to enact laws to make sure that corporate CEOs take responsibility for their books, make sure that when somebody says they've got X amount in liabilities, that X equals X and not X equals Y or something less than X. Yes, I strongly believe that, and the SEC needs to get after it. And I don't use the excuse of not enough money in the budget, frankly. I need to know the numbers, but we need action. And we need reasonable action, without causing a plethora of lawsuits.
Hutch [Ron Hutcheson, Knight Ridder].
Perspective on the War on Terrorism
Q. Thank you, sir. I wanted to ask about the second phase of the war. As a member of the Vietnam generation, do you worry as you send these military advisers all over the world, typically to chaotic places, that they may get involved in direct conflict and the situation could escalate? And are you prepared to do that?
The President. Interesting question. Hutch, let me tell you something, I believe this war is more akin to World War II than it is to Vietnam. This is a war in which we fight for the liberties and freedom of our country.
Secondly, I understand there's going to be loss of life and that people are going to—and the reason I bring that up is because for a while, at least for a period, it seemed to be that the definition of success in war was, nobody lost their life. Nobody grieves harder than I do when we lose a life. I feel responsible for sending the troops into harm's way. It breaks my heart when I see a mom sitting on the front row of a speech and she's weeping, openly weeping for the loss of her son. It's—it just—I'm not very good about concealing my emotions, but I strongly believe we're doing the right thing.
And Hutch, the idea of denying sanctuary is vital to protect America. And we're going to be, obviously, judicious and wise about how we deploy troops.
I learned some good lessons from Vietnam. First, there must be a clear mission. Secondly, the politics ought to stay out of fighting a war. There was too much politics during the Vietnam war. There was too much concern in the White House about political standing. And I've got great confidence in General Tommy Franks and great confidence in how this war is being conducted. And I rely on Tommy, just like the Secretary of Defense relies upon Tommy and his judgment—whether or not we ought to deploy and how we ought to deploy.
Tommy knows the lessons of Vietnam just as well as I do. Both of us—he was a—he graduated from high school in '63, and you and I graduated in '64. We're of the same vintage. We paid attention to what was going on. And so—I think it was '64, wasn't it?
Q. No, sir.
The President. Oh. [Laughter] You're not that old. You're not that old.
I'll give you an interesting fact: I don't know if you all know this or not, speaking about Tommy, but Tommy Franks went to Midland Lee High School, class of '63. Laura Bush went to Midland Lee High School, class of '64. That's an interesting thing for the social columns. [Laughter] For those of you who allow for your news-gathering to slip into social items—[laughter]—or social gossip, which sometimes happens. It doesn't happen that much.
Q. Did they know each other?
The President. No. [Laughter] Elisabeth [Elisabeth Bumiller, New York Times].
Immigration and Naturalization Service
Q. Mr. President, who do you hold responsible for the failure of the INS this week? I see the Attorney General said he was going to hold individuals responsible——
The President. Going to do—hold——
Q. Hold individuals responsible.
The President. Well, let's see what the Inspector General comes back with. But obviously, I named a good man to run it, Ziglar, and he's held accountable. His responsibility is to reform the INS. Let's give him time to do so. He hasn't been there that long, but he now has got another wake-up call. The first wake-up call was from me: This agency needs to be reformed. And secondly, he got another one with this embarrassing disclosure today that, as I mentioned, got the President's attention this morning. I could barely get my coffee down when I opened up my local newspaper—well, a newspaper. [Laughter]
U.N. Security Council Resolution
Q.
Mr. President, back on the Middle East, sir, can you tell us what was behind the timing of pursuing a U.N. resolution at this point regarding a future Palestinian state?
The President. Well, there was a—sometimes these resolutions just get a life of their own. And sometimes we have to veto them, and sometimes we can help—help the message. This time, we felt like we were able to make the message a clear message that we agreed with. If it was a message that tried to isolate or condemn our friend, I'd have vetoed it. In this case, it was a universal message that could lead to a more peaceful—a peaceful world. And so we supported it. As a matter of fact, we helped engineer it; we were a part of the process.
And as to the timing, I don't know the timing. All I know is the things start showing up on my desk. And——
Q. When did it start showing up on your radar screen, sir?
The President. Well, desk or radar screen, same thing. About 24 hours ago. And I heard from the Secretary of State and Condoleezza Rice that there was a little movement afoot there at the Security Council. And so we made a decision, a conscious decision to try to send a statement that it was a hopeful statement. It turned out to be a good statement, by the way. It was one of those statements that was embraced by all the parties except for one that couldn't bring themselves to vote for it, Syria.
But again, we are working hard to create the conditions for a security arrangement that will then enable the Mitchell process to kick in. I know you all are tired of hearing me say that. But unlike other parts of the world, in this part of the world, Tenet and Mitchell have been agreed to by both parties, which means there is a hopeful process if we can get people into the process. And so our mission is to do that. And that's why Zinni is over there.
Listen, I want to thank you very much. I've enjoyed this press conference. I hope you have as well. Thank you."
"March 22, 2002",The President's News Conference With President Vicente Fox of Mexico in Monterrey,George W. Bush,"George W. Bush, The President's News Conference With President Vicente Fox of Mexico in Monterrey Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/215532",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-vicente-fox-mexico-monterrey,"President Fox. Good afternoon. Thank you very much. Yes, in fact, it has been a very productive meeting, a meeting where we have touched upon three subjects, three chapters. One deals with what we have called the border alliance, intelligent borders, and the smart border initiative.
The purpose is, firstly, to introduce the safety factor and hold it as an important priority and, at the same time, with the same emphasis, to seek for efficient borders, customs that are efficient as well, for an expeditious flow both of people, merchandise, products. And in this sense, what we seek is for those using these crossings, which are hundreds of thousands of people every day, to do so with that efficiency we are talking about. Likewise, within this same sense, we talked about a program to modernize, technologically speaking, our borders. And this would promote that efficiency.
Among other points within this same category, we have also spoken about opening in airports that have high traffic, both in the United States and Mexico, a line to take care of the Mexicans and Canadians coming into Mexico and, in the case of Mexico, taking care of U.S. citizens and Canadian citizens.
The second topic is what we have called the Partnership for Prosperity, where there are plenty of topics but the specific purpose is to generate opportunities for advancement, opportunities for income, and mainly in communities with high migratory rates in Mexico. For this purpose, we have spoken of joining efforts to facilitate resources for micro-, small-, and medium-sized companies, who are the ones generating the highest number of jobs.
We have spoken of also working to bring down the cost of migrators' remittances to their families in Mexico, and this way facilitating those resources becoming productive projects toward important generation of employment and opportunities.
We talked about important program of scholarships where, on the U.S. side, there will be investments up to $50 million, precisely to promote these scholarships and promote to the state level the creation of scholarships for universities. This is important in the purpose of creating, forming human resources.
And on the other hand, we have also spoken of generating and facilitating resources for infrastructure, especially at the border, infrastructure for an efficient use of water, for water treatment plants, infrastructure for ecological or environmental purposes at the border, and some other investments in infrastructure along the same lines, the border.
On the other hand, I believe it is very significant, and we have talked about it again, to have this great drive that has been announced by President Bush at the Financing for Development Conference. And it's the purpose to try to increase important resources for countries that are not as developed, for poorer countries. We have heard from many leaders present, many heads of state, who truly expressed this was welcome information, a welcome announcement. And of course, same goes for us. We are not a country to receive the help, but we clearly understand that there are countries who require this help to combat poverty very close to us, such as the case of Central America.
So we hope that these additional funds, I repeat, have been very welcome, well-received by the community of smaller countries present here. This time these same resources also, part of them, to be used in these countries of Latin America or Central America.
This effort of what has seemed to be called the participation in the millennium, the challenge of the millennium, is important for us. And we have verified this importance it has for the community of countries.
Thank you. Now Mr. Bush will speak.
President Bush. Thank you for your hospitality, and thank you for hosting the important conference on reducing global poverty. It was a success, thanks to your leadership and your vision.
I'm so glad that the world could see Monterrey, Mexico. It is a really dynamic city. It's important for the world also to realize that as a result of President Fox's vision, this country is reforming. It's a vibrant place. It's an exciting place for people to live. People are finding jobs in Mexico.
And Mr. President, I am grateful to call you friend. Thank you for your leadership as well.
I try to remind people in my country, as many times as I can, a vibrant, prosperous Mexico is in the best interests of the United States of America. We were at the White House on September the 5th, and here's what I said then: ""The United States has no more important relationship in the world than the one we have with Mexico."" I believed it on September the 5th; I believe it today. And since September the 11th, those words have been tested and proven. I deeply appreciate President Fox's early support and his continuing advice. And on behalf of the American people, I thank the people of Mexico for their support and sympathy.
The relationship between the United States and Mexico is very strong, is very important, and it's growing stronger every day. America respects Mexico's culture and Mexico's achievements. By embracing markets and fiscal discipline, Mexico has created one of the most resilient economies in the region. And through NAFTA, our nations have forged one of the world's most dynamic trading relationships. Every day we exchange more than $650 million worth of commerce, creating wealth and opportunity for consumers and workers and families on both sides of the border.
President Fox and I are determined to extend the benefits of free markets to all our citizens. As part of our Partnership for Prosperity, we'll help focus private investment on less developed parts of Mexico, creating more jobs and more opportunities for more people.
President Fox and I are determined to make our shared border modern, efficient, and secure. The smart border declaration our countries have just signed will move us toward this important goal. Our common border must be closed to drugs and terrorists and open to trade and legitimate travel. America is grateful for Mexico's fight against the drug cartels, and I salute your many breakthroughs this year, Mr. President.
President Fox and I talked about migration. Last year, we established a process to address this issue. We're making good and steady progress. Migrants make a valuable contribution to America. It's also important for our Nation to recognize, as we discuss immigration, Mexico has got a unique place in this issue. Mexico is different from other countries not only because of our proximity but because of our special relationship.
We made some progress this year on an issue called 245(i). It's an important piece of legislation. It allowed families to stay together. It passed the House of Representatives. Unfortunately, it got stalled in the United States Senate. And my hope, Mr. President, is we're able to get it out of the United States Senate and to my desk so I can sign it.
President Fox and I agreed on measures to reform the North American Development Bank, known as NADBank. We will increase the Bank's ability to make low interest loans to address urgent environmental priorities along the border. We also agreed to expand the Bank's range, so more people can benefit.
Mexico and America are proud nations united by timeless values, by democracy, by faith, and by freedom. We have a modern relationship sustained by a mutual respect and trust. We've entered a new era of trade and cooperation and prosperity.And the United States and Mexico are building an historic partnership, one which will benefit both our peoples and provide a good example for the rest of the world.
International Family Planning/Middle East Peace Efforts
Q. President Bush, have you or General Zinni heard anything from Chairman Arafat that indicates that a meeting between him and Vice President Cheney could help catalyze an Israeli-Palestinian truce? And honoring President Fox's request that we focus on poverty over this summit, could I also ask you to explain why your administration is withholding the $34 million that Congress appropriated to the United Nations Population Fund, why it's—[inaudible]— this year's budget?
And President Fox, do you have any thoughts about the administration's decision on the United Nations Population Fund?
President Bush. Let me start with the latter. That violated the one-question rule, but—I said we're not going to use taxpayers' money to fund abortion. And we're going to make sure, before we spend taxpayers' money, that we're not funding abortion.
And as to your first question, as I have said all along, General Zinni will assess the situation in the Middle East. And a meeting could happen if and when Chairman Arafat performs, does what he's supposed to do. Those conditions have been laid out by Vice President Cheney. And now General Zinni is trying to determine whether or not he is going to do what he said he would do.
President Fox. The second question, what is the question to me?
Q. Your reaction to President Bush's decision to withhold $34 million from the United Nations Population Fund and their family planning work around the world.
President Fox. None. No comment. His decision is totally independent. No comment from my side.
President Fidel Castro of Cuba
Q. My question concerns both Mexico and the United States, in a way. President Bush, the Cuban Government claims that President Fidel Castro's early departure from the summit is a result of pressures from your Government. And Mr. President, I want to know if you really would have felt uncomfortable to encounter Fidel Castro here in Monterrey?
And for President Fox, Mr. President, what is the relationship between Mexico and Cuba now, after Ricardo Alarcon made the Government of Mexico responsible for President Castro's early departure?
President Bush. First of all, I know of no pressure placed on anybody. I mean, Fidel Castro can do what he wants to do. And what I'm uncomfortable about is the way he treats his people. There's only one country that's not a democracy in our hemisphere, and that's Cuba. And it makes me uncomfortable to realize that there is still one country that doesn't have free press, freedom to speak, freedom to realize your dreams. And I feel strongly about that, and I'm going to continue to speak out on the fact that this island is a place of repression, a place where the people don't have hope.
Q. Did you pressure anybody?
President Bush. I don't know what you're talking about, about pressuring anybody. I just said that.
President Fox. There has been no modification in our relationships. We said goodbye to Mr. Fidel Castro. His visit ended. And there is no modification or alteration.
U.S.
Assistance to Peru
Q.
Mr. President, President Bush, are you prepared to offer Peru new military assistance to help crack down on terrorism in the wake of the bombing in Lima? And is it time to resume drug surveillance——
President Bush. On the drug surveillance issue, we have yet—not made up our mind yet. We're analyzing not only what took place in the past but the most effective way to help Peru fight narcotics.
The first part of the question? I'm sorry, Steve [Steve Holland, Reuters].
Q. Helping Peru with terrorism with new military assistance.
President Bush. We're going to analyze all options available to help Peru. But the first place we need to help Peru is to get the Andean Trade Preference Act out of the U.S. Congress. One of the messages I'm taking to not only Peru but the other Andean nations is, ATPA is important. It's important to my administration, it's important to their future, and I'd like to see it renewed as quickly as possible.
President Fidel Castro of Cuba
Q. Thank you. Good afternoon. The Cuban Government says that the Mexican Government was pressured. The Mexican Government said they had no pressure. Who is lying, Mr. President Fox? Who is lying, Mr. President Bush, the Cubans or the Mexicans? Thank you.
President Bush. I thought I just answered that question. [Laughter] Maybe I missed it—or you did. [Laughter]
President Fox. There is no such thing. Mr. Fidel Castro visited Mexico, visited the conference, the U.N. conference. He was here, he participated in the conference, and he returned to Cuba—nothing more.
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq
Q. President Bush, good evening. During his recent trip to the Middle East, the Vice President made it very clear that at each stop, he told our Arab allies that no military action against Iraq was imminent. Isn't it also true that this administration is telling our allies, Arab allies and others around the world, that this government is, however, committed—as committed to removing Saddam Hussein from power as the administration was for removing the Taliban?
President Bush. Let me put it to you this way, David [David Gregory, NBC News]: What we're telling our friends is that Saddam Hussein is a man who is willing to gas his own people, willing to use weapons of mass destruction against Iraq's citizens. Evidently, there's a new article in New York magazine or New Yorker magazine—some east coast magazine—and it details about his barbaric behavior toward his own people. And not only did he do it to his own people, he did it to people in his neighborhood. And this is a man who refuses to allow us to determine whether or not he still has weapons of mass destruction, which leads me to believe he does. He is a dangerous man who possesses the world's most dangerous weapons. And it is incumbent upon freedom-loving nations to hold him accountable, which is precisely what the United States of America will do.
I haven't had a chance to explain this to our Mexican friends, but a nightmare scenario, of course, would be if a terrorist organization such as Al Qaida were to link up with a barbaric regime such as Iraq and thereby, in essence, possess weapons of mass destruction. We cannot allow that to happen.
And so, David, what I've told others, including President Fox, is we have no imminent plans to use military operations. We'll be deliberate; we'll consult with our friends and allies. But we'll deal with Saddam Hussein. And he knows that. And this is exactly what I've been saying ever since I've been the President.
Q. Does that mean you will remove him——
President Bush. As I said, yes, we'd like to see a regime change in Iraq. That's been the longstanding policy of the U.S. Government. Nothing is new there. That's precisely what has been said since I became President of the United States. But close consultations with our friends from all around the world—and they—I think people have got a pretty good sense of how I view him. And I hope that, of course, he allows inspectors to go into his country, like he promised he would do, not for the sake of letting inspectors in but to showing the world that he has no weapons of mass destruction.
Immigration
Q. Good evening, Mr. President. If truly your government has contemplated some date about the migratory agreement with Mexico? And also, here at the forum there was something from former President Carter for amnesty for 3 million Mexican workers in the U.S. Your government would consider legalizing them, or are you saying no?
President Bush. I think the best way to describe what is possible in the United States is that beyond 245(i), which is the family reunification, is, first of all, understanding the unique nature of the Mexican in our country, that the Mexican national is different by virtue of the fact of the proximity to the United States and that we do have a special relationship between our countries, not only defined by NAFTA but defined by cultural ties and historic ties. And so I think that ought to be a part of any discussions.
But here's my attitude. I think what our country ought to do is help match any willing employer with any willing employee, so that if somebody is looking for somebody who wants to work and somebody wants to work, we can facilitate that arrangement.
And we've got a lot of discussions and work to do. But what I've assured President Fox and his administration is that we will continue working on this issue. We've got technical groups working on it, and he and I will continue working on it.
President Fox. Thank you very much. Good evening."
"March 23, 2002","The President's News Conference With President Alejandro Toledo of Peru in Lima, Peru",George W. Bush,"George W. Bush, The President's News Conference With President Alejandro Toledo of Peru in Lima, Peru Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/212852",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-alejandro-toledo-peru-lima-peru,"President Toledo. This is an historic visit made by a friend representing a country with which we have had a historical relationship. It is not a merely diplomatic visit; it is an official working visit. And we have touched on substantive issues which range from the open struggle against poverty, a war without quarter against terrorism and drug trafficking. I repeat, a war with no ambiguities whatsoever, against terrorism and drug trafficking. We've touched on issues of trade, education, even the Peace Corps.
But my friend George Bush, this Peru is a country that welcomes you with open arms. We are renewing our friendship, and this is the beginning of a new era in the relationship between Peru and the United States. And I'm extremely happy that the two of us are able to begin this relationship.
I know you seem younger than I am, but we are both 55 years old, and we have a long way ahead of us to work together. I know that we both have the energy and the stubbornness, particularly with regard to the issue of terrorism and drug trafficking, because your country, just like mine, loves peace. It appreciates life. And we are united on this. And as of today, we have a strategic alliance of hope for the future.
My friend, welcome to my country.
President Bush. Gracias, Senor Presidente. It is an honor for me to be the first sitting President of the United States to visit Peru. I want to thank you for the invitation. It's a greater honor for Laura and me to come here as guests of a leader who symbolizes Peru's revitalization.
President Toledo and I have now met three times. At each meeting, I've been impressed by his commitment to democracy and his determination to improve the lives of the people of Peru. Peru is on the path toward greater freedom and greater prosperity, and America will be the partner in this progress, Mr. President.
Earlier today our two Governments signed an agreement that will reintroduce the Peace Corps to Peru, after an absence of nearly 30 years. The first volunteers will arrive in August, a symbol of the stronger ties between our people and the stronger relationship between our nations.
This relationship is based on common values and common interests. Our nations understand that political and economic progress depends on security, and that security is impossible in a world with terrorists. Peruvians have been reminded again this week of the terrible human toll of terror. On behalf of the people of the United States, I express our deep sympathy for the victims of the recent bombing and our deep sympathy for their loved ones.
President Toledo and I share a common perspective on terrorism: We must stop it. Since September the 11th, Peru has taken the lead in rallying our hemisphere to take strong action against this common threat. And I want to thank the President for his leadership and his strong support.
Our nations understand that freedom is only as strong as the institutions protecting it. The United States is actively supporting the President's efforts to strengthen Peru's democratic foundations. And we will continue to support the work of Peru's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which is helping correct the abuses of the past and set the course for a better future.
President Toledo and I both understand the importance of providing economic opportunity to all our citizens as a hopeful alternative to the drug trade. We discussed ways to make the assistance that the United States provides under the Andean Regional Initiative more effective. And I emphasized to the President my commitment to renew and extend the Andean Trade Preferences Act. The United States House of Representatives has moved this legislation. It is stuck in the Senate, and I urge the Senate to act.
President Toledo and I have agreed to renew discussions on a bilateral investment treaty and to complete a debt-for-nature agreement to help Peru reduce debt payments while it protects its biodiversity. I also informed the President that Secretary of Commerce Don Evans will lead a trade mission to Peru and the Andean region later this year. By building these ties of commerce, both our nations create more jobs, more investment, and more benefits for workers and consumers.
President Toledo and I believe that education is the key to participation in the global economy. The President's own path in life is a lesson in how education opens up doors to opportunity. He is passionate on the subject. I love his passion, and I appreciate his commitment. And I'm pleased to announce that our country will help establish an Andean Center of Excellence for Teacher Training, with a base here in Peru. The center will support President Toledo's goal of quality schools with quality teachers, that give more Peruvians the literacy and learning they need to succeed.
I've also directed the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency to establish an Andean E-Business Fellowship Program, to give more high-tech professionals from this region the chance to learn more about information technology.
President Toledo and I have a strong relationship. I'm inspired by his life; I'm inspired by his story; I'm inspired by his leadership. I'm impressed by Peru's progress, and I'm very confident of Peru's future.
Thank you, sir.
Q. Mr. President——
President Bush. Which one? [Laughter]
Counterterrorism Efforts
Q. You, sir. Given increasing evidence that the FARC is now operating in Peru, will you be willing to provide President Toledo extra assistance in fighting the war against terrorism here, should he ask for it? And are you concerned that what was once a regional problem in Colombia, or something restricted to Colombia, is now spreading across Colombia's borders and threatening its neighbors?
President Bush. We discussed the neighborhood at length today. President Toledo told me that he is—now that he's done a very good job, or the country's done a good job, of making sure that relations with neighbors north and south are peaceful, that he is moving troops and making decisions to prevent terrorists from coming into his country from Colombia. And we will help him in this effort. That's part of the reason why we're here—is to support our mutual desire to fight terror and to help this good democracy thrive.
Later on today we'll be talking with Presidents from—and one Vice President— from the Andean nations. And we'll be discussing our common desire to prevent terrorist groups like the FARC from holding people and nations hostage. And I'm absolutely convinced, having talked to the President three times, that he will do everything in his power to rout out terror, not let it take hold, and preserve the institutions that make Peru a beacon for democracy.
Q. [Inaudible]
President Toledo. No, the evidence that we have is—I repeat, the evidence that we have indicates that there is no transfer of the FARC into Peru. However, we are adopting every measure possible. The Minister of Defense was at the border very recently. We took our bases that were along the border with Ecuador—where, after signing the peace agreement, there is no need for their presence—we removed them, as a precautionary measure, over to the border with Colombia.
As President Bush just indicated, this is a joint task. What happens to Colombia affects us, and vice versa. But here, too, we're partners. And I think that the issues that have to do with the Andean community are issues on which President Bush is extremely interested, and I'm sure that we will be working together on these. We are going to work together on this; I'm sure of that.
Peru-U.S. Relations
Q. President Bush, you granted an audience recently to my daily, El Comercio, at the White House, and you said in that interview that Peru, for the United States, is not only a friend but an ally. I'd like to ask you, beyond trade preferences and the commitment to struggle against drug trafficking, what will be the major elements in your administration that would highlight this different relationship you want to have with Peru? For example, would you open up an antechamber, so to speak, for Peru to come into a free trade agreement negotiation with the United States?
And let me ask President Toledo, with regard to the issue of shared responsibility in the fight against drug trafficking, would you take on the commitment, before President Bush, to establish a control office that would monitor whatever the United States does not comply with?
President Bush. I listed quite a few things in my opening remarks about our relationship. I believe strongly that if we promote trade and when we promote trade, it will help workers on both sides of this issue. It will help Peruvian workers, help U.S. workers.
The Andean Trade Preference Act is a cornerstone of good policy, as far as I'm concerned, and it's a cornerstone of good relations. We talked about a treaty on investment; that could be the beginning of a trade treaty. The President brought it up. He asked whether or not we would consider it. I said we'll take it back and discuss the issue when I get back to Washington, D.C.
There's nothing more important than fostering good economic relations. I mean, the best way for people to get lifted out of poverty is a job. And the best way to encourage jobs is through trade. I mean, what we're beginning to realize in the world is, development aid is important, but development aid pales in comparison to the amount of capital that's generated through trade in the marketplace, in the private sector. And countries that open markets and countries that trade freely are countries where the people are more likely to be able to succeed.
And I would not discount the importance of our relationship when it comes to fighting terror. The world has called us to action. This is a new era. We're fighting a new kind of war, and we're strong allies in that war. And when we win, our peoples will be better off. You can't alleviate poverty if there's terror in your neighborhood. It's impossible to achieve what we want if terrorists run free.
And so I think one of the best things we can do to lay the foundation for a better tomorrow is to be tough and firm and not yield to threat. And that's exactly the way the President feels, and I can assure you that's the way I feel.
President Toledo. I think that in the war against drug trafficking and terrorism, we are partners, not simply through conviction, my good friend, but because we, ourselves, have experienced it. We have experienced the effects of terrorism here for 20 years; the United States, on September 11th. And I have here my friend Colin Powell, with whom we have a very solid human relationship because, in this very palace, we were witnesses to the news of September 11th while we were having breakfast.
On this issue, we are partners; I am stubborn. I am stubborn, and I believe it is not incompatible to respect the law and to be strong-handed with regard to the issue of terrorism and drug trafficking. I do know there's been a decision from the U.S. Government to increase support for the struggle against drug trafficking, and I appreciate that enormously. We still have a long road ahead to walk together in this struggle, but we will do it.
And Mr. Journalist, I want to underscore something that was referred to by President Bush. Trade preferences is an issue on which President Bush has demonstrated— and I am a witness—his will for congressional approval in the United States. The separation of powers makes it impossible for Presidents to control congresses—just like I don't control mine. But that's the way democracy works.
Nonetheless, we have gone beyond trade preferences—Andean trade preferences. I have asked of President Bush that he consider an initiative for trade, for bilateral trade and investment within the framework of the Andean community. And we are going to be talking to our colleagues in just a few minutes.
I think it's important because trade is a synonym for work, and work is a way to deal with poverty. Through work, education, and health, we can eradicate poverty. We are partners on the issue of trade, on the issue of drug trafficking and terrorism, in the defense of democracy and of human rights, my friend—human rights.
Peru-U.S. Drug Control Cooperation
Q. Mr. President, the Peruvians have expressed an urgent desire for the resumption of U.S. drug interdiction flights in Peruvian airspace. You told us yesterday in Monterrey that the issue was under rigorous review. My question to you, sir, is it your ultimate goal to see a resumption of those flights? And what preconditions would you put on those flights before authorizing resumption?
And for President Toledo, if I could, sir, if you are to expect a maximum effort at a partnership with the United States to eradicate drug trafficking, why won't you make the same commitment to coca eradication as your neighbors Bolivia have? You've talked a lot about the problem being drug trafficking, but you have not made the same commitment on coca production, sir.
President Bush. We are reviewing all avenues toward an effective policy of interdiction. As you know, we had a terrible situation where a young mom and her daughter lost their life; that caused us to step back to take a look at our policy at home and then to work with the Peruvian Government to figure out how best to be effective at interdicting drugs.
And so the discussions are ongoing. And we want to make sure that when we work with countries like Peru, that we achieve the common objective, which is to make it hard for those narcotraffickers to move through their airspace, across their land, or in oceans.
I want to say something about—there's a lot of talk about interdiction, and there should be. And there's a lot of talk about battling the narcotraffickers here in the Andean area, and we will. But our country has an obligation as well, not only to provide support and help. The President mentioned that we have expanded the direct aid to Peru on this issue, which we have. We've tripled it, up to about $200 million— about 195 million, I think it is. But the best thing that America needs to do is reduce demand for drugs. We've got to do a better job of convincing our own country to quit using them. As demand for drugs goes down, it will take the pressure off of our friends in Peru.
So we've got a double obligation, it seems like to me: on the one hand, to provide help and aid that's effective and will work. And that's exactly what we spent a long time talking about, in all three of our meetings. But I want to remind our Peruvian friends that we've got to do a better job at home of convincing Americans to stop using drugs. And part of our drug initiative will be to focus on the demand side. Less demand for drugs will mean that the supply for drugs will be less urgent. And that will in turn help the region.
President Toledo. Look, my friend, let me deal with your question head on. In 1990, the number of hectares with coca cultivation was approximately 140,000 total. Today, we are down to 34,000 hectares, where we have coca cultivation. Enormous progress has been made.
I know it's not enough. We have a long path ahead of us yet. And we have to do this together. I know that the drug traffickers have become more sophisticated over time; they have more high-tech capabilities. And now we, too, have to push forward in that direction.
I want to be very open, and I apologize to my friend President Bush now. We are not fighting against drug trafficking in order to satisfy the United States or Europe. Drug trafficking, in partnership with terrorism, is an issue of national security. It's an issue of national security. On Wednesday they killed 9 people, 9 of our brothers and sisters, and there are 30 people wounded. I have publicly stated, and I want to repeat this: We are not going to let this stand.
So let me respond to you. We have met a substantial reduction. We still have 34,000 hectares to go. But we are going to do this together.
Final point. I think President Bush is extremely sincere—he's extremely sincere and honest when he recognizes that as long as there is a demand out there, there will be a supply. As long as there are consumers, there will be producers. And so, together, we need to work on reducing the number of consumers, cure them better, make them better. And we need to reduce the amount of hectares under cultivation.
And, footnote here, it's also true that the statistics indicate that although levels are still low, there is an increase in the consumption of cocaine among youth in Peru. And that is also part of our concern, with regard to national security.
U.S.
Assistance to Peru
Q.
President Bush, you are in a region now that's been devastated by terrorism and subversion and drug trafficking for over three decades. You're offering us the Peace Corps. I would ask you if you're willing, as President of the most powerful nation on Earth, to lead a Marshall plan for South America?
President Bush. I appreciate that. I think I said more than just the Peace Corps, if I'm not mistaken, in my opening comments. Obviously, our Nation is committed to this part of the world. I've come to Peru, as the first sitting President, to express our solidarity with Peru and the people, as well as express my appreciation for a reformer who got elected who's willing to defend the institutions that make democracy go.
I repeat, if you'd like me to—go through the litany of things I just said: the Andean Trade Preference Act; the bilateral action on investment; money for education; money to fight drugs. We've tripled the amount of money—I believe it's from $50 million up to $195 million available. And so I think our commitment is—I think our commitment speaks for itself. And I appreciate so very much the chance to come and explain it to the Peruvian people—that ours is more than just words; ours is deeds and action.
Situation in the Middle East
Q. Good afternoon, President Bush. Buenas tardes, Senor Presidente. President Bush, many lawmakers in Congress are growing increasingly concerned about your policy in the Middle East, wondering if the very talk of potential high-level negotiations involving Vice President Cheney, specifically, with the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, might not in fact send a signal that terrorism against Israeli civilians can achieve some limited political aims. I'd like to ask you, sir, why you're contemplating that, and why those who wonder if that is not the case are incorrect?
President Bush. Well, first of all, I think there's been no question that the United States has stood strong with Israel. And we've made it very clear to Mr. Arafat that he is not—he's not doing all he can do to fight off terror. I can't be any more clear than that. Vice President Cheney said, depending upon the Zinni mission and General Zinni's recommendation, he might go back, if and when Arafat performs.
Surely those in the Congress you talk about appreciate the fact that the administration is engaged and sent General Zinni into the region. We laid out the Tenet plan, which is the way to bring some security to the region, which would then lead to the Mitchell plan. And we're doing everything in our power to get the parties into Tenet. And we'll continue working hard to get them to Tenet.
Q. Even if the violence continues——
President Bush. If and when—if and when Mr. Arafat—if and when——
Q. [Inaudible]
President Bush. Excuse me. If and when Chairman Arafat performs, that's what we have said. General Zinni went to the Middle East; he's leading discussions. But people shouldn't mistake our desire to get into Tenet as anything more than a desire to get to peace. And we'll continue working to do so.
And Prime Minister Sharon knows where the United States stands. We're strong allies with Israel. We have been ever since I've been the President, and we'll continue to be strong allies with Israel.
U.S.
Assistance to Peru
Q.
Good afternoon to both Presidents. President Bush, just a few days ago I was able to ask you in Washington about leadership in the fight against poverty. And on this—aside from the issue of being 55 and the fact that you're wearing the same color ties—you are in agreement with President Alejandro Toledo, who also insists on fighting against poverty. But the fight against poverty presupposes—and this has been stated by Dr. Toledo—thinking of reducing arms in Latin America, because for every tank or F-16, we could buy a lot more schools. Mr. President, I'd like to know your views on this and the views of President Toledo with regard to this issue, the possibility of arms control in the South American part of the hemisphere. And the same question for President Toledo.
President Bush. We may be the same age, but el tiene pelo negro. [Laughter] Yo tengo pelo gris. [Laughter]
I appreciate President Toledo's work to have a security arrangement in place in the neighborhood, amongst the countries bordering Peru, that will then allow him to reinvest in education. We talked about that.And I think that is a strong commitment and a wise commitment.
As far as my country's commitment goes, I gave a speech in Monterrey, Mexico, 2 days ago, where I committed our country to a 50 percent increase in development aid. But I said, it's time for the world to stop looking at inputs and to focus on outputs and that the United States, developed nations, must do more financially. And we're leading the way.
But we expect other nations to develop the habits that will lead to a better opportunity for their people: rule of law, a focus on education, and good health care. President Toledo understands that; he's been a leader in that effort. And I think what I said in Monterrey was very important, that unless we all focus on how programs benefit people directly, no matter what the efforts or strategy is, it's likely to lead to failure. But programs and policies that understand the worth of each human being, that each individual matters, are those programs which will be successful. And so our country will try to foster that. And this President has made that commitment, for which I am grateful.
President Toledo. Aside from the fact that President Bush has very good taste with regard to color in ties, he's also taller than I am. [Laughter]
On this issue of military expenditure, we discussed it with him. And here I want to strike a difference between military expenses for armed conflicts between countries and military expenditures for defense against terrorism and drug trafficking, because these are two separate issues.
I think that there is a major challenge in the world. In order to survive in this globalized and savagely competitive world we live in, we need to invest more in the minds of our people. Basically, what this means is investing more in nutrition, health, education, and justice for the poor. We won't be able to deal with the challenges of this globalized world unless we invest in the knowledge of our societies.
The question immediately arises, and obviously so, in an economy that is growing, that is overcoming a recession, where do you get the money to invest in nutrition, health, and education? Well, we've made an appeal to countries at the bilateral level. And there the United States has played a very generous role, at the donors table in Madrid. And I want to publicly express my appreciation, Mr. President. There has been debt conversion, external bilateral debt swap, for social investment. And there we have been able to get a commitment of about $1 billion. This is one way to establish a financial space to invest in health, nutrition, and education.
The other thing is that I believe it makes no sense in this world that as long as we have a country with 54 percent of Peruvians who live below the poverty line or 16 percent who live below the dire poverty line—when I was born, the very first minute of my life when I opened my eyes, I saw the face of dire poverty. I know what this means. That's why I am convinced that we can make an effort to reduce military spending, to reorient those resources towards investment in justice and education and health, because the defense of a country no longer depends on how many tanks or ships or aircraft we have. It's all about how strong our economy is, how educated our people are. And please excuse me for being so passionate on this subject, but there is absolutely no doubt on this. And the empirical evidence is very harsh with regard to the return on investment on education and health and nutrition for our people.
And here, once again, we have another point of coincidence that leads us down the same path together. I conveyed something that's very close to my heart, with regard to the Huascaran education program, and I asked our friend to support us on this. And I will be going to New York, and I'm going to talk to Mr. Bill Gates to try to promote the Huascaran project even more. But if we reduce military spending, we're going to have some financial leeway to reorient this money towards the poor, who want to overcome poverty, who want freedom. And we'll be able to deal with the challenges of the future even better.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much."
"March 24, 2002","The President's News Conference With President Francisco Flores Perez of El Salvador in San Salvador, El Salvador",George W. Bush,"George W. Bush, The President's News Conference With President Francisco Flores Perez of El Salvador in San Salvador, El Salvador Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/215536",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-francisco-flores-perez-el-salvador-san,"President Flores Perez. Good afternoon. It is an honor for us to be here with you and to be able to answer the questions that you want to ask President Bush and myself. I would like to start by saying that for El Salvador, it is an immense honor to have President Bush in our land.
El Salvador has been a country that has faced enormous difficulties—the war, combat against poverty, earthquakes. And El Salvador has done this through a system of freedoms in the search of a democracy, the search of economic freedom as well— giving people the opportunity—the opportunity to get education, to trade of their products, and to integrate into the new world.
So a country like ours that believes in freedom feels especially honored to have a world leader that has built a leadership based on values and principles, values that have to do with the rights of human beings. And this allows us, countries that are so different like the United States and El Salvador, to find each other in a common point.
So welcome to our country, President Bush. It is an immense honor to have you here in our country.
President Bush. Gracias, Senor Presidente, mi amigo. Thank you, President Flores, for providing such warm hospitality in this beautiful country. Laura and I were struck, when we flew in, about your beautiful mountains and your beautiful sea. I'm honored to be here for the first time in my life.
We've just completed our fifth meeting— this is the fifth time that the President and I have met. And in each of them, I have come away from our meetings most optimistic about the future of El Salvador. I truly believe this country has got a unique President and a great President. El Salvador—and the reason why I believe that is because of the success of the country.
El Salvador is one of the really great stories of economic and political transformation of our time. Just over a decade ago, this country was in civil war. For millions of Salvadorans, violence was a daily reality, and prosperity was just a distant dream. Today, El Salvador is at peace. The country has renewed its commitment to democracy and economic reform and trade. It is one of the freest and strongest and most stable countries in our hemisphere.
The United States considers El Salvador a close friend and strong ally. As friends, we come to each other's aids in times of crisis. Since September the 11th, El Salvador has been unwavering in its support for the international coalition against terrorism. I want to thank the President and the people of El Salvador for their prayers for the American people during this crisis. I want to thank you as well for ordering a freeze on suspected terrorist assets and for strengthening your border security.
And when the devastating earthquakes hit El Salvador last year, the United States immediately dispatched rescueworkers and relief assistance. We proudly contributed millions of dollars to El Salvador's reconstruction effort. And we will spend even more in the year 2002.
Our countries are united by ties of commerce and culture and kinship. The large number of Salvadorans who live in the United States make valuable contributions to our economy and send approximately $2 billion back home to family members in El Salvador each year, cada año. Trade between our countries now approaches $4 billion annually. That is up 140 percent. And trade means jobs. Trade means people who want to work are more likely to find jobs in both countries.
El Salvador is one of the really bright lights in Latin America. Many countries in this region have changed old ways and have found new wealth and new freedom. In this coming decade, El Salvador and the United States and nations throughout this hemisphere are committed to maintaining and extending this progress.
Greater trade can help us accomplish this goal. In January, I announced we would pursue a free trade agreement with Central American nations. And the President and I, after this press conference, will be having lunch with other leaders in Central America to discuss this very proposition. And we're also going to continue to pursue the Free Trade of the Americas, which aims to encompass the entire hemisphere in a free trade agreement. Completing these agreements will promote prosperity throughout the hemisphere and reinforce the region's progress toward political and economic and social reform.
I just met with two El Salvadorans, who are seated right here, who personify the cause of reform. One's an architect, and one's an economist. They are El Salvador's first two participants in the Americas Fellows Program. Soon, they will be coming to Washington to spend time working in the United States Government offices, where I believe they will acquire new skills and training. And they can bring them back home and share them with others. And thank you all so very much about participating in the program.
I'm also optimistic about this country's future. There's no doubt in my mind that because of this man's leadership, there are bright days ahead for El Salvador. And it's an honor to be invited here, and it's an honor to call him friend. And I want to confirm the fact that this Nation remains a strong ally with the great people of El Salvador.
Senor Presidente, gracias.
Questions.
El Salvador-U.S. Trade/Immigration
Q. Good afternoon, President Bush. Good afternoon, President Flores. As you said, I'm William Melendez from Channel 12, and I have the honor of trying to summarize the questions of all my other colleagues and the mass media of El Salvador.
Presidents, the benefits, the needed benefits of a free trade agreement can delay themselves, if we are not mistaken, to arrive to our countries, maybe 5, 6 years, because the mechanism is a bilateral mechanism, bilateral negotiation. And so the migration could continue working hard during that phase.
I would like to know, what will the treatment be of the United States of America for those fellow men of ours, so that they can regulate their migration status immediately? And besides, since poverty is the weakness, what conditions could be applied so that the countries, the poorer countries of our region, especially El Salvador, can optimize their resources and avoid that the states could become main allies of the economic oligopolies?
President Bush. A couple points. One, you're right, trade agreements sometimes take too long. And we intend to push as hard as we possibly can to get the trade agreement done. I was very serious when I announced the trade agreement, and we're going to work hard to expedite the agreement.
Secondly, the President made an interesting suggestion, which I will take very seriously. He said, ""Make sure that a country is allowed to accelerate its moving into a free trade agreement."" In other words, if the country meets conditions and—conditions of rule of law and private property, conditions that I'm confident El Salvador will meet early—let us make sure that if another nation hadn't met those conditions, El Salvador can ascend to the free trade agreement early.
So one way to cut the time is to analyze the President's request. It made a lot of sense to me, and we'll take a good look at it.
There's no question there's a lot of hard-working Salvadorans in the United States. And the first thing I want to assure the people of this good country is that we want to make sure they're treated with respect. We want them to be—we recognize—I recognize that family values, something we talk a lot about in America, don't stop at the Rio Bravo.
There are people who care deeply about their families in El Salvador. They want to work. They're looking for jobs. And so the cornerstone of good economic policy, or good immigration policy, is to match a willing employer with a willing worker, to make that happen, to facilitate that arrangement. And that's going to be the cornerstone of immigration reform in the—as this issue comes up in Congress.
On the other hand, there are specific areas of immigration policy that affects the people of El Salvador, starting with TPS. My administration granted TPS last time the issue came up. And it doesn't come up until September, and we'll take a very hard look at it this summer.
And the second issue is a bill that's working through the Congress, introduced, if I'm not mistaken, by a Democrat and a Republican—one named Berman, one named Davis—that would grant the same status to Salvadorans, Hondurans, Guatemalans, as those granted to Nicaraguans and Cubans. And we will take a look at that bill as well.
In terms of oligopoly, the best way to avoid oligopolies is to encourage open markets and competition. The best way to make sure that oligopolies do not dominate an economy to the detriment of the people is to do what the President's done: Insist that the markets be open; insist that competition allowed—is encouraged. And another way to enhance open markets and competition is through trade, honest, open trade.
And so that's what I've come to talk about today. And I believe President Flores is on the absolute right track to making sure oligopolies don't dominate this economy.
Ken Walsh, U.S. News, fine American. [Laughter]
Campaign Finance Reform
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, when you return home, new campaign finance legislation will be awaiting your signature. I wonder if you could tell us if you're going to—given your criticisms of campaign finance legislation in the past—if you're going to sign this bill reluctantly or wholeheartedly, what the impact you think will be on our political system, and how you regard the impending legal challenge to the legislation?
President Bush. I sign it—I have a kind of a firm, semifirm signature, as it moves across the page—[laughter]. I wouldn't be signing it if I didn't think it improved the system. And I think it improves the system this way: One, individuals will be allowed to contribute more to the campaigns. I've always been skeptical of a system where monies were put into the system where people didn't have a choice, whether it be a labor union worker or a shareholder of a corporation. Sometimes shareholders of corporations—they might make an investment for, hopefully, a good rate of return, and yet they wake up and realize that some CEO or somebody's made the decision to support a political party or a candidate not of their choosing. And I've always thought that the individual ought to have a choice. And so, therefore, the fact that the system encourages more individual participation, I think, is positive.
Finally, they've raised individual limits. I also think this will help challengers. And as much as I now love incumbency— [laughter]—I think it's important to encourage challenges in the system.
I am worried about some of the provisions; I stated so in my signing statement.One such provision was that you can't— they're going to try to control who can participate in the election process in the last 60 days. And we'll see whether or not that stands up. I'm going to stay, by the way, totally apart from the legal matters.
One of the things I'm disappointed in the law is—and again, this may not stand a court challenge—but I've always thought that people who pump money into the political system—we ought to know who they are. I was a little discouraged—not discouraged—I was quite discouraged at the end of the 2000 campaign to see tons of dollars flowing into the political campaign at the last minute, on these so-called independent groups, and we didn't know who was funding them. And you know the kind of ads I'm talking about, scurrilous, untrue ads, coming into the campaign—a so-called front group, independent, and we don't have any idea who's putting the money in. And that's not good for democracy.
And so I didn't particularly appreciate the fact that this campaign bill didn't adequately address full disclosure. Now the excuse, evidently, was the courts won't allow it. Well, I would have liked to have seen them challenge the system, to see whether the courts might allow it now that we're going into the 21st century.
But nevertheless, the bill is a better bill than the current system, and I'm going to sign it. And there will be—I take it back; it will be a signature. I won't hesitate. It will probably take about, you know, about 3 seconds to get to the ""W""; I may hesitate on the period and then rip through the ""Bush."" [Laughter] Thank you.
Free Trade Agreements
Q. Good afternoon to both Presidents. The first question is for President Bush, because we're talking about taking very seriously the free trade agreement with Central America. President, you're also saying and talking about openness. You said that we were going to eliminate subsidies, in the International Conference for Development in Monterrey. But the market of the United States continues being a protectionist with your national— there are subsidies for agriculture. I don't know how much it would be willing—that is, your government—to eliminate these subsidies that are really disrupting the market of the small producers. And also, if the Senate is going to approve, in the short term, the permit to start the negotiations, because it also— the advancement of the free trade agreement will depend on this also.
President Bush. Let me just say one thing. Look, we buy more goods from all around the world than any nation. And of course, we're the biggest nation; we're the biggest market. But nevertheless, we buy billions of dollars of goods on an annual basis—billions. I think it's like 650 billion a year the United States purchases from countries. And Africa alone—we signed a free trade agreement with Africa, and we had a billion dollars of purchases last year, which significantly increased employment in Africa.
And there are some instances where we've got—farm policy, for example, where people—where the Congress has decided to fund certain programs. But this—our market is wide open. And by the way, anytime there's unfair trade, we will respond. And I have done so, and will continue to do so, because free trade must be fair trade as well. But I think if you look at the facts and statistics, you'll find that the U.S. market is one of the most open markets in the world, and we intend to keep it that way.
President Flores Perez. I would like to say the following: Never, never, in the history of El Salvador, El Salvador has had the opportunities that they have with the United States of America, thanks to the initiative of the Caribbean Basin. And never has El Salvador had the possibility of signing a free trade agreement with the United States before. So the possibility of openness that the region has with the United States has no precedent in the history.
Today, that we were flying with President Bush from the airport to this site, I was telling him what this openness is doing in El Salvador. And I was explaining to him that many women in the rural areas have opportunities to work today, thanks to that openness of the United States. And it is producing a dramatic change throughout the rural areas of our country.
Undoubtedly, the comparison between donated funds and trade is a comparison that is very different, because it is so much more important to have trade than donations. So in this sense, we believe that the focus of President Bush is absolutely true, that the only way to come out of poverty is through work. And the way to generate employment in our region is, giving the possibility of investment and work and labor.
Obviously, the agricultural topic is a topic—is an issue, but this has had an enormous advance for——
Q. [Inaudible] President Flores Perez. ——the Salvadorans and the region.
President Bush. Are you asking another question?
Q. Yes.
President Bush. Okay. What is it?
Q. Excuse me. My colleagues from Guatemala are asking that in Guatemala there has been the withdrawal of the visas to some militaries. And they want to know if this is part of the control or the enforcement of the improvement of economies that the countries are asking for.
President Bush. [Inaudible]
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, what is——
President Bush. Raise the mike a little.
Q. Don't think it goes that high.
President Bush. Okay. [Laughter]
Democratic Party's Radio Address
Q. What is your reaction to the Democratic Party using its national radio address to criticize you on foreign soil, saying you made this trip to Latin America merely to pander to Hispanic voters?
President Bush. Wow. That was the ad?
Q. Yes.
President Bush. Or not the ad, but the— well, I guess I'd say, I'm disappointed. When I first got elected, I said, the best foreign policy for the United States is to have a prosperous, peaceful, and free neighborhood. My first trip as President of the United States, out of the United States, was to Mexico. And my longstanding interest in this—in Mexico and Central America is well known.
I firmly believe that the best policy for the United States is to pay attention to our friends, is to promote trade. Trade produces liberty and freedom. And sometimes in Washington, DC, people cannot get rid of old habits—which is petty politics, Mr. President. But that's just what happens. But people in America know that our administration is focused on what's best for America. And what's best for America is a prosperous and peaceful El Salvador, y Mexico, y tambien los paises in Sur de América. There is a great opportunity for all of us to be equal partners, to work otros para todos los personas que viven in nuestros paises.
Senor Presidente, gracias. El honor es mio de está en este pais. It has been my honor to be in this country. Thank you very much. We have to all work together to make this happen.
President Flores Perez. I just wanted to say, just to close this conference, that El Salvador, through myself, wants to express their profound appreciation to the United States of America for having accompanied us in so many difficult times. And this has to do with the leadership of President Bush. And Salvadorans want to recognize you at this moment.
And I would like to end by saying this— and this is very personal—I have had some honors in my life, but never had I had such a high honor as President Bush calling me his friend.
Thank you very much."

Bush, The President's News Conference With President Jacques Chirac of France in Paris, France Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/213830",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-jacques-chirac-france-paris-france-0,"President Chirac. Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. Welcome here. Welcome to all of you here this afternoon. Of course, I extend a special welcome to the members of the press who have come with President Bush.
Can I, first of all, say how pleased I am that we'll have the opportunity to welcome on his first trip to France the President of the United States and his wife. It's, of course, a great pleasure for me to welcome them, and I think it's also a great pleasure for all the people of France to welcome them. And that is something that I wanted to say in no uncertain terms.
We had this afternoon a working session. We'll meet again over dinner. Tomorrow, as all of you know, President Bush will be in Normandy. And I think it's very moving for me and for the people of France to know that, for the first time ever, if I'm not mistaken, the President of the United States will not be in the United States on Memorial Day, and that on this occasion the President will come and pay a solemn tribute to the great number of young American servicemen who gave up their lives to fight for France, for Europe, for freedom.
This fight for freedom, for liberty, is a constant fight, a fight that we all engage in, a fight that is a bond between the peoples of both sides of the Atlantic, a fight that is pursued still today under very specific ties, the fight against terrorism.
We exchanged views. We had an intense, candid, friendly exchange of views. And I think this echoes and epitomizes the nature of the dialog that we have had ever since President Bush's election, in the number of contacts we have had either in Europe or when I have been to the United States. I think the last time we met was when we both were in Monterrey, in Mexico, and also over the phone.
We mentioned a number of issues: the fight against terrorism—and in this respect, we have a similar understanding of what is being done and what should be done to fight and eradicate terrorism. We both know that terrorism still exists, that it can be active anywhere, at any time, and that, therefore, all the leaders across the world must pay great attention to this issue and be determined to eradicate terrorism.
We also mentioned strategic issues. In this respect, we paid special attention to the change and the developments in the relationship between the U.S. and Russia. And we welcome this change. Russia is a major nation, a great nation. And I think that the relationship between Russia and the U.S. are crucial in the world today.
On Tuesday, in Rome, we will have an opportunity to set in stone this change in the relationship, to act upon also the new treaty that has been signed between both Presidents in Moscow yesterday. We have an opportunity to make more concrete the relationship between NATO and Russia. And as you know, for a long time, the French position has been that the relationship between Russia and NATO should be strengthened. And you might even remember that the founding act was signed here in 1997, even though it didn't have quite the consequences that we could have expected. This being said, nowadays Russia— from now on, Russia will be closer involved. And this will be the results of the NATO council in 2 days' time in Rome.
We also mentioned, of course, the list of strategic issues, the fight against proliferation—proliferation in a number of regions across the world. We also mentioned the relationship between France and the U.S. and, of course, the relationship between the EU and the U.S. These relationships are very good at a political level. They are instrumental for the equilibrium and the balance of our world. At an economic level, they're essential, instrumental in the good health of the global economy. There can be, indeed, no balance in our world if there is no strong relationship between the U.S. and the EU.
We also spoke about issues where we have diverging views: trade issues, for instance; the farming bill, for instance. And in this respect, the President said that there might have been—there could have been a misunderstanding of what the goals of the farming bill was, a misunderstanding here in France and in other places, maybe. But I think that this means that we have to have more consultation, more consultation between the U.S. and the EU. We also, of course, mentioned steel.
These are, of course, very real issues, and real answers have to be given to these problems, after consultation and intense dialog. But can I just remind you that these differences, these diverging views only account for 5 percent of the trade between the EU and the U.S. Of course, that's important, but we have to have a look at the greater picture and have a sense of perspective.
We also mentioned a number of other issues in which we have slight divergence of views: environment, for instance; the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. And I, personally, stressed the fact that there was a very real danger, a very real risk in going on consuming more of our planet than the Earth can actually produce. And I think that all of us know that these are very real issues and that we have to go on talking, discussing, and working together on these issues. And I'm sure—I'm convinced that we will find the right ways to produce, to consume, new ways to do so. And I think all the new technologies that are being developed nowadays will enable us to do so, while at the same time, consuming less of our natural resources and better control of pollution. Of course, these issues are being discussed in other fora.
We also discussed globalization. And I said that, yes, of course, globalization is unavoidable and is positive, because it increases trade and thus production and thus wealth and thus the number of jobs that there are across the world. This being said, there is a necessity that we have to bear in mind, and that is controlling globalization so that the development of the people in other countries is protected. So what I am saying is that globalization in trade has to go hand in hand with globalization of solidarity.
We will be, this evening, mentioning a number of other issues, international crisis, for instance: the Middle East; the topical issues, the tension between India and Pakistan; be talking about Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, the Balkans, and Africa. We'll be talking about Africa in the context of the new relationship that is currently being developed in the relationship between rich and poor countries.
We've already, in a way, touched upon these issues. And I wanted to—I did stress when we were talking with President Bush that as a longtime advocate of aid to poor countries and relationship between poor and rich countries, what I stressed is that for a very long time, these issues haven't been considered properly and that in Genoa we had, for the first time, a very real discussion about Africa. And that will be what we should remember of Genoa, although people will remember other things of the Genoa summit.
And I think that this was partly do to the initiative taken by President Bush that gave us a real opportunity to talk about development—development at large and development of Africa, more specifically. And this also enabled us to move from a situation where we give assistance to Africa, to a situation where we have a partnership with Africa. And that also is one of the goals of our next meeting in the G- 7 format in Kananaskis, in Canada, where we will talk about the NEPAD. We also spoke of some local situations about in Africa.
So all that is what we've done today. We've spoken in a very understanding and friendly atmosphere.
President Bush. It's true. [Laughter]
I am honored to be here in France. It's my first trip as the President to this beautiful country and to this beautiful capital. I always find it a great joy to talk with Jacques Chirac. He's a—it's not hard to figure out where he stands on issues, and he's a good friend. He's a friend to me, personally. He's a friend to my country, and for that, I'm grateful.
I'm also looking forward to going to Normandy tomorrow. We do believe this is the first time a President has been out of the country for Memorial Day. I'm looking forward to giving a speech. Memorial Day in my country is a day to honor those who have sacrificed for freedom, given their lives. Many died in France, and I'm looking forward to the moment to share my country's appreciation.
And we—in the talk, I'm going to talk about—there's been current—modern-day sacrifices. We still fight people who hate civilization. It was—or at least, civilization that we love; they can't stand freedom— it was President Chirac who was the first head of state to visit me in the White House right after September the 11th. I was very grateful for that visit. As he, himself, said, that we're in a fight to defend civilization, and I couldn't agree more with him. And I want to thank the French people for not only the sympathy shown for my country after September the 11th but the strong support in the war against terror.
Jacques and I spent a lot of time talking about how to better fight this fight, and that's not just in military terms. I speak in terms of doing a better job of cutting off money to terrorists, denying them safe haven, and as we fight for a safer world, how to make the world a better world. And one of the things I really admire about—I guess I should call you President Chirac—President Chirac is that you've had this great compassion for the developing world, and I appreciate your compassion, and I appreciate your heart. It's important that we continue to work together to make sure that there is a strategy in place to help people develop and grow and prosper.
I'm looking forward to the dinner. He's always saying that the food here is fantastic, and I'm going to give him a chance to show me tonight. And I also look forward to continuing our discussions on important issues, like how to make sure NATO works better, how best to continue to work with our friends in Russia, how we can work together to—in the Middle East to bring peace to that part of the world. I appreciate this good man's advice. I listen carefully to it when he gives it, and I'm proud to call him friend.
Thank you for your hospitality.
President Chirac. Thank you.
Pakistan-India Relations
Q. Mr. President, you mentioned this morning that you had expressed strong reservations to President Musharraf about the missile test in Pakistan. I'm wondering, sir, whether your administration actually asked President Musharraf not to conduct those tests, and second, whether you regard the escalating conflict there as a threat to U.S. forces in the region? And finally, as tomorrow is the first Memorial Day since 9/11, can you say to the American people how this Memorial Day will be somehow different from those past?
And President Chirac, you mentioned in your opening comments that the response to the President's strategic initiative with Russia from a year ago had not been what you had anticipated. Do you think that perhaps the Europeans overreacted a year ago to what President Bush was proposing to do with Russia? And were you suggesting, sir, that perhaps you underestimated this President?
President Bush. Like everybody else. [Laughter] Pakistan—yes, we expressed deep concern, and we'll continue to express concern about testing and our—I'm more concerned about making sure that—insisting, along with other world leaders, that— including the President of France—that President Musharraf show results in terms of stopping people from crossing the line of control, stopping terrorism. That's what's more important than the missile testing, is that he perform.
I'm jet lagged—what's the first couple of questions?
Q. The second one, sir, was I was wondering if the escalating conflict posed a threat to U.S. forces in the region.
President Bush. I would certainly hope not. Third? Is that it? [Laughter]
Memorial Day
Q. Memorial Day.
President Bush. Oh, Memorial Day. Thanks. That's what happens when you're over 55. [Laughter] You know what I mean.
Let me say one quick thing about Memorial Day. All Memorial Days are solemn days, particularly for those who mourn the loss of a loved one. All Memorial Days are days in which Americans ought to give thanks for freedom and the fact that somebody sacrificed for their freedom. This Memorial Day is the first Memorial Day in a long time in which younger Americans know firsthand the price that was paid for their freedom.
President Chirac. On that very last point, can I maybe just say that it really is very moving for all the people of France and Europeans at large to see that President Bush—that the President of the United States will be for the first time outside the United States on Memorial Day and that he come to Normandy to pay tribute to all those—many American—who gave their lives for freedom. This, I think, is a very strong gesture that we will not forget.
Maybe a question for a French journalist? Yes.
France's Role in the War on Terrorism
Q. Mr. President, Mr. Bush, after your trip to Russia, what would be for you a more decisive ally in your war against terrorism? Would it be Russia or this little corner of this continent which is called Western Europe? And please, Mr. President, don't say ""both""—this wouldn't be the beginning of an answer.
President Bush. Both. [Laughter] What was that? I didn't get the full question. I got ""Russia,"" and I got ""this little corner of Europe."" But what was the question? Who do I rely on more?
Q. What is for you the more decisive ally in your war against terrorism?
President Bush. Decisive ally? Ally? Decisive ally? Of course, Jacques Chirac. [Laughter] I—listen, thank you for the trick question. Let me talk about this ally. The phone rang the day after the attack—the day of the attack. I can't remember exactly when, but it was immediately. And he said, ""I'm your friend."" On this continent, France takes the lead in helping to hunt down people who want to harm America and/or the French or anybody else.
We've shared intelligence in a way that is really important. One of the most important things in fighting the war on terror is to understand how the enemy thinks and when the enemy might strike. And make no mistake about it, they'd like to strike again. You know, some people would wish that their thoughts go away. These are cold-blooded killers, and it requires strong cooperation to protect our citizens. My most important job—and I suspect Jacques feels the same way—is to protect our citizens from further attack. And it's—we've got no stronger ally in that task. I mean, he is willing to take steps necessary, obviously within the laws and Constitution of this country, just like I'm within the Constitution of mine, to protect our people. And for that, I'm very grateful, Mr. President.
I'll call on the Americans.
President Chirac. An American journalist, maybe?
Russia and Iran
Q. Yes, sir. You said in Russia that President Putin had offered some assurances about Russian sales of nuclear energy technology to Iran that we would find comforting. Aside from his statement that Russia doesn't want Iran to have nuclear weapons, what did you find comforting? And secondly, President Putin also argued that the plant he's building there is quite similar to the one and others have offered to build in North Korea. Is that accurate, sir?
And President Chirac, you mentioned that the two of you were talking about proliferation matters. Do you also have concerns about Russia's relations with Iran?
President Bush. Well, first, I think it's important to understand that President Putin understands that an Iran that's got the capacity to launch a missile is dangerous for him and his country. He understands that.
Secondly—and we had a very frank discussion about the potential—or the development of a nuclear powerplant that he is convinced will not lead to the spread of technologies that will enable Iran to develop weapons of mass destruction, and is willing to allow for international inspection teams to determine whether that's true or not. And we're thinking about what he told us.
Q. And the plant in North Korea, sir, is that different from the one he's building in Iran?
President Bush. As I say, we're thinking about what he told us.
Q. President Chirac?
President Chirac. I share, unreservedly, the position outlined by President Bush, by George.
French journalist?
Regime Change in Iraq/Situation in the Middle East
Q. France would like to see the Middle East peace conference convene the quickest possible, and the U.S. to do—to act for it. May we know, what are your forecasts for this Middle East conference, and when do you think it will happen, and if president Arafat will be participating in such a conference? Also, I would like to know, if possible, what are your plans for the Iraqi regime? Are you really willing to change the Iraqi regime, and how?
President Bush. Okay. Whew, a lot of questions here. Let me start with the Iraqi regime. The stated policy of my Government is that we have a regime change. And as I told President Chirac, I have no war plans on my desk. And I will continue to consult closely with him. We do view Saddam Hussein as a serious, significant—serious threat to stability and peace.
In terms of the Middle East, this week we will be sending American officials back into the region to work with the parties, to have a political dialog, start a political dialog, as well as develop a security force within the Palestinian Authority that can— will function like a security force, actually do what they're supposed to do.
And in terms of meetings, conferences, our view is, is that we need to develop a strategy, to continue working with our Arab friends on that strategy, and then the Secretary will be convening a ministerial conference sometime this summer. Obviously, depending upon the progress being made and how much progress we are making toward establishment of the institutions necessary for a Palestinian state to evolve, that progress will determine how many conferences are necessary until we eventually get to, hopefully, the end of the process.
My Government and I, personally, strongly believe that it's in everybody's interest that there be two states living side by side in peace. And that's the vision we work toward. The good news is, is that many in the Arab world are now working with us to help create an environment so we can get to that—to those two states. And to that end, I viewed the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia's declaration of a— declaration that Israel should live in peace with its neighbors is incredibly important breakthrough. And we're seizing that initiative and seizing that opportunity to work together.
President Chirac. Last question, for the American press, maybe?
President's Visit to Europe
Q. You said in reaction to demonstrations against you and your administration during this trip in Europe that it's simply a healthy democracy exercising its will, and that disputes are positive. But I wonder why it is you think there are strong—such strong sentiments in Europe against you and against this administration? Why, particularly, there's a view that you and your administration are trying to impose America's will on the rest of the world, particularly when it comes to the Middle East and where the war on terrorism goes next?
[At this point, the reporter asked the rest of his question in French, and the interpreter translated it as follows.]
Q. And Mr. President, would you maybe comment on that?
President Bush. Very good. The guy memorizes four words, and he plays like he's intercontinental. [Laughter]
Q. I can go on.
President Bush. Yes, I'm impressed. Que bueno. Now I'm literate in two languages. [Laughter]
So you go to a protest, and I drive through the streets of Berlin seeing hundreds of people lining the road, waving. And I'm—look, the only thing I know to do is speak my mind, to talk about my values, to talk about our mutual love for freedom and the willingness to defend freedom. And David [David Gregory, NBC News], I think a lot of people on the continent of Europe appreciate that, appreciate the fact that we're friends, appreciate the fact that we've got—we work together, that there's a heck of a lot more that unites us than divides us. We share the same values; we trade $2 trillion a year. I mean, there's—so I don't view hostility here. I view the fact we've got a lot of friends here, and I'm grateful for the friendship. And the fact that protesters show up, that's good. I mean, I'm in a democracy. I'm traveling to a country that respects other people's points of view.
But I feel very comfortable coming to Europe. I feel very comfortable coming to France; I've got a lot of friends here.
Q. Sir, if I could just follow——
President Bush. Thank you.
President Chirac. Look, the demonstrations you've been referring to, sir, are indeed, as the President has just said, healthy and normal in democracies. That is one of the means of expression that people have. And it's only normal and important that people should respect that. Of course, there are limits; there are constraints that have to be enforced, and that is what is being done. But I think that it is only normal that, in the face of a very important political event, those who have a different understanding of things should express their diverging view.
The right to demonstrate is a fundamental right intertwined with democracy. And there's no need to tell Americans about that; they know it. But what I just wanted to say is that these demonstrations are really marginal demonstrations, that you shouldn't give too much credit to these demonstrations. They do not reflect a so-called natural aversion of such-and-such a people in Europe to the President of the United States or to the U.S. people as a whole.
Yes, we do have diverging views on this or that issue; it's only normal. And that is the result of interests, of our national interests, and they're not always converging. And I think it's only healthy that these demonstrations should occur, that we should express our diverging points of views, and that we should find democratic answers to these questions.
As for the relationship between Europe and the United States, it is a very old relationship, as you know. It is a fundamental relationship for the balance—for the equilibrium of our world. But I would also add that it's an increasingly important relationship, and it's—it would be the sign of short-sightedness to refuse to acknowledge that.
The United States and Europe are the two major economic powers in our world. And in our world the economy drives social progress. Economic power helps express political power. So I think that there is a very real, a deep-rooted link between Europe and the United States, and that's— the bedrock of that link, the roots of that link is the shared values that we have together. And that must be used to guarantee the balance of our world, the stability of our world.
And that's precisely why we welcome the trip of an American President in Europe— President Bush, in this case. But generally, a statement of generalities would be to say that we welcome a visit by the President of the United States because it shows the solidarity between the two sides of the pond, the two sides of the Atlantic, something that is fundamental for the stability of our world.
Well, thank you, ladies and gentlemen."
"October 25, 2002","The President's News Conference With President Jiang Zemin of China in Crawford, Texas",George W. Bush,"George W. Bush, The President's News Conference With President Jiang Zemin of China in Crawford, Texas Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/216963",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-jiang-zemin-china-crawford-texas,"President Bush. I want to welcome the President of China to our ranch and to Texas.
I want to start off by saying how sad Laura and I are about the sudden and tragic death of United States Senator Paul Wellstone, his wife, and one of his children, as well as the death of others on that private airplane. Our prayers and heartfelt sympathy goes to their sons, their loved ones, their friends, and the people of Minnesota. Paul Wellstone was a man of deep convictions, a plain-spoken fellow who did his best for his State and for his country. May the good Lord bless those who grieve.
This is the third meeting of the President and me, and our personal relations and the relations between our two countries are strong. In our meeting, we discussed the threat posed by the Iraqi regime. China supports Iraq's strict compliance with U.N. Security Council resolutions. And today we discussed and I urged President Jiang to support a new Security Council resolution demanding Iraq fully disarm itself of weapons of mass destruction.
The President and I also discussed and expressed concern about the acknowledgment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea of a program to enrich uranium. We agreed that peace and stability in northeast Asia must be maintained. Both sides will continue to work towards a nuclear-weapons-free Korean Peninsula and a peaceful resolution of this issue.
The United States and China are also allies in the fight against global terror, and our two countries are deepening our economic relations. It is inevitable that nations the size of the United States and China will have differences, but the President and I agree that we need to resolve our differences through mutual understanding and respect.
On human rights, I emphasized that no nation's efforts to counter terrorism should be used to justify suppressing minorities or silencing peaceful dissent. I shared with the President my views on the importance of China freeing prisoners of conscience, giving fair treatment to peoples of faith, and preserving the rights of Hong Kong citizens. I also spoke of the importance of respecting human rights in Tibet and encouraged more dialog with Tibetan leaders.
On proliferation, I expressed our continuing concerns about transfers of sensitive technologies.
On Taiwan, I emphasized to the President that our ""one China"" policy, based on the three communiques in the Taiwan Relations Act, remains unchanged. stressed the need for dialog between China and Taiwan that leads to a peaceful resolution of their differences.
The United States seeks and is building a relationship with China that is candid, constructive, and cooperative. We will continue building this relationship through contacts at many levels in months to come, including a new dialog on security issues.
I'm pleased to announce that Vice President Cheney will visit China next spring. The United States and China believe that a strong relationship between our nations will help to build a more peaceful world.
Thank you for coming, President Jiang.
President Jiang. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, I just learned that one plane crashed. I would like to express my deep condolences for the loss of the Senate. And also I would like to express my condolences to the bereaved family.
I'm very pleased to visit President Bush at his ranch. I would like to thank President Bush and Mrs. Bush for the warm hospitality accorded to us. President Bush and I had a very good conversation. We exchanged views on some important issues of mutual interest. The meeting has been constructive and productive.
We all agree that China and the U.S. are two great nations sharing extensive and important common interests. The two sides should increase exchanges and cooperation in economic, trade, cultural, educational, and other fields. We should stepup dialog and coordination on major international and regional issues, and constantly move our constructive and cooperative relationship forward.
We are satisfied with our counterterrorism cooperation of the past year. We agreed to strengthen such cooperation in a two-way and mutually beneficial manner and work together against terrorism in all forms and manifestations.
We have had a frank exchange of views on the Taiwan question, which is of concern to the Chinese side. I have elaborated my Government's basic policy of peaceful unification and one country, two systems, for the settlements of the Taiwan question. President Bush has reiterated his clear-cut position that the U.S. Government abides by the ""one China"" policy.
We did, indeed, discuss the nuclear issue concerning DPRK. I point out that China has all along been supporter of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula and wants peace and stability there. I agreed with President Bush that we will continue to consult on this issue and work together to ensure a peaceful resolution of the problem.
We have also discussed human rights, religion, and other issues. I told President Bush that democracy and human rights are the common pursuits of mankind and that China's human rights situation is at its best time, characterized by constant improvement. Regarding our differences in these areas, the Chinese side stands ready to continue exchanging views with the U.S. side on basis of mutual respect and seeking common ground while shelving differences, with a view to deepening understanding and enhancing consensus.
I'm confident that, so long as the two sides persist in viewing and handling their relations from a strategic height and with a long-term perspective and keep expanding cooperation and enhancing mutual trust, China-U.S. relations will be able to grow steadily and bring benefits to both peoples.
Thank you.
President Bush. Thank you, Mr. President.
I told the President that we would— asked him if we could take some questions. He said, ""Sure."" There will be two questions from each side. And I promised him I would do my very best to make sure that the questioners would only ask one question, if you know what I mean, Mr. Fournier [Ron Fournier, Associated Press]. [Laughter]
President Jiang said he remembered a couple of the American reporters were quick to break the one-question rule, and he asked if a fellow, Fournier, would be there. And I said, ""Well, surely he won't do it this time.""
Mr. Fournier. [Laughter]
Q. I understand that means I can ask each President one question? [Laughter]
President Bush. That's exactly the problem. [Laughter]
North Korean Nuclear Program
Q. I'll be glad to—I'll be glad to—your question, President Bush, is, Are you willing to negotiate with North Korea, while North Korea maintains a nuclear weapons program?
And, President Jiang, could you tell us, do you think North Korea's nuclear weapons program is a threat to your country, and, if so, how do you plan to stop it?
President Bush. See, I told you he wouldn't abide by the one-question rule. [Laughter]
Our first step, to make sure we resolve this peacefully, is to work with our friends, is to remind our friends of the dangers of a nuclear regime on the Korean Peninsula. President Jiang made it clear that China, like the United States, believes in a Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
This is a chance for the United States and China to work very closely together to achieve that vision of a nuclear free— nuclear-weapons-free peninsula. And so I've instructed Secretary Powell to work very closely with his counterpart, as well as with their counterparts in South Korea and Japan and Russia, to come up with a common strategy to convince Kim Chong-il to disarm. And we look forward to working to that end.
And so to complete our—the important dialog of developing a strategy that will hold North Korea to account in terms of disarming, I'm going to be visiting with the Prime Minister of Japan and the leader of South Korea tomorrow in Mexico.
President Jiang. I can answer your question in the most clear-cut terms and most definitely that we Chinese always hold the position that the Korean Peninsula should be nuclear-weapon-free. We are completely in the dark as for the recent development. But today President Bush and I agreed that the problem should be resolved peacefully.
Thank you.
China-U.S. Relations/""One China"" Policy
Q. I'm from CCTV. My first question is for President Jiang. This is your third meeting with President Bush. How do you evaluate China-U.S. relations in the past year, and how do you envisage the future of the relationship?
And also a question for President Bush. Just now you——
President Bush. It's an international problem. [Laughter]
Q. ——said that the United States supports a ""one China"" policy. What concrete step would you take to translate this commitment into reality?
President Jiang. In the past year, China and the United States have expanded their cooperation and enhanced mutual understanding and trust. On the whole, the relationship has enjoyed a good momentum of growth. Facts have proven once again that, despite the profound changes in the international situation and despite the differences of one type or another between China and the U.S., our two countries have more, rather than less, common interest. And the prospect of cooperation between us has become broader, rather than narrower.
President Bush. In terms of your question about the ""one China"" policy—""one China"" policy means that the issue ought to be resolved peacefully. We've got influence with some in the region. We intend to make sure that the issue is resolved peacefully, and that includes making it clear that we do not support independence.
Holland [Steve Holland, Reuters].
U.N. Resolution on Iraq
Q. Sir, do you feel like you've got China's support for a new resolution on Iraq? And are you willing to make any more concessions in the language of a U.N. resolution, now that Russia and France have offered a watered-down resolution?
President Bush. Thank you for asking one question. [Laughter] Now I'll try to answer it.
I made it clear to the President of China that I am interested in seeing to it that the United Nations is effective—effective in disarming Saddam Hussein. That's what the United Nations has said for 11 years, that Saddam ought to disarm. And therefore, any resolution that evolves must be one which does the job of holding Saddam Hussein to account. That includes a rigorous, new, and vibrant inspections regime, the purpose of which is disarmament, not inspections for the sake of inspections.
And any resolution which will be effective must have—there must be consequences. Let me put it bluntly: There must be consequences in order to be effective. And therefore, in order for there to be consequences, we won't accept a resolution which prevents us from doing exactly what I have told the American people is going to happen. That is, if the U.N. won't act and if Saddam won't disarm, we will lead a coalition to disarm him. And we're working with all countries, particularly those on the Perm 5, to do just that.
And that's what we'll accept, something that will enable us to do precisely what I have just described and what I describe almost every day that I'm out there talking to the American people.
You tried to violate the rule, but I'm not going to let you.
China-U.S. Relations
Q. I'm from Xinhua news agency. For some time, certain people inside the United States call for containment against China. These people believe that a rising China poses a growing threat to the United States. What is your comment?
President Jiang. Given their different national conditions, it is only natural for China and the United States to disagree from time to time. Such a disagreement should be viewed and handled with a broad perspective. China has chosen a development path suited to its national conditions. It has enjoyed a rapid progress in economic growth, cultural development, and the building of democracy and rule of law, bringing tangible benefits to the Chinese people. Their quality of life and standard of living are improving.
As the biggest developing country in the world, this road is still very long before China achieves full modernization. Our central task and long-term goal remain one of economic development and improvement of people's living standards.
The Chinese people have a tradition of peace loving. China has never engaged in expansion nor sought hegemony. We sincerely desire peace all over the world. Even when China becomes more developed in the future, it will not pose a threat to others. Threats have and will continue to prove that China is a staunch force for the maintenance of world and regional peace.
Thank you.
President Bush. Thank you all very much."
"May 07, 2003",The President's News Conference With President Jose Maria Aznar of Spain,George W. Bush,"George W. Bush, The President's News Conference With President Jose Maria Aznar of Spain Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/213020",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-jose-maria-aznar-spain,"President Bush. Welcome. It's also my honor to welcome an important friend of America, President Jose Maria Aznar. I welcome you back to the Casa Blanca. It's good to see you again.
Jose Maria is a man of principle and a man of courage. Under his leadership, Spain has been a strong partner in the war against terror and has stood with a coalition to liberate the people of Iraq. He believes in freedom, freedom for all.
Together, Spain and America will continue to meet the responsibilities of free nations for the peace and security of the world.
We last met in March at the Atlantic Summit in the Azores. The 8 weeks since have been a momentous chapter in the history of freedom. We liberated the people of Iraq from a brutal dictatorship. We brought greater security to people of all nations.
I want to thank the President for Spain's diplomatic support before the conflict and for the use of Spanish airspace and bases as the war grew closer. I also offer my condolences to the family and friends of the two members of the Spanish media who lost their lives while covering the hostilities.
Both Spain and the United States are committed to a stable, democratic, and peaceful future for the people of Iraq. Spain has shown that commitment by sending medical and engineering units to help the Iraqi people, and I thank you for that help.
Today I moved to ease sanctions imposed by the United States against Iraq's old Government. First, based on the authority recently given to me by Congress, I am suspending the Iraq Sanctions Act, which restricts the export of certain equipment necessary for Iraq's reconstruction.
Secondly, I am directing Treasury Secretary Snow to relax administrative sanctions on American companies and citizens conducting business in Iraq that contributes to humanitarian relief and reconstruction.
Soon, at the U.N. Security Council, the United States, Great Britain, and Spain will introduce a new resolution to lift the sanctions imposed by the United Nations. The regime that the sanctions were directed against no longer rules Iraq. And no country in good conscience can support using sanctions to hold back the hopes of the Iraqi people.
Across the globe, Spain and America will continue as strong allies in the war against terror. Today the United States took steps to cut off financing for the Batasuna organization, because of its ties to the ETA. We believe that the people of Spain, like everywhere, have a right to live free from terror.
We'll also work for a better world beyond the war on terror. We are committed to expanding trade, which builds prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. We'll work together to address global poverty and the terrible diseases such as HIV/AIDS.
Spain and the United States will stand on the side of people everywhere who are striving for greater freedom, tolerance, and opportunity. We are determined to help build peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Last week's confirmation of Abu Mazen and his cabinet permitted the release of the roadmap for peace, developed with Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations. Spain and the United States are determined to take advantage of this moment of opportunity for peace. I'm grateful for the wise counsel and for the friendship of Jose Maria Aznar.
Bienvenidos.
President Aznar. Good afternoon, everyone. I would, firstly, like to thank President George Bush and thank him because of his kind invitation. And I want to thank the President personally because, upon his initiative, the U.S. Government has taken an extremely important decision in the antiterrorist struggle by illegalizing Batasuna, that has supported—considering it a terrorist organization, as part of the terrorist organization that has made so many victims in Spain.
I want to recall here in the White House precisely that in July 2001—that is to say, before 9/11—President Bush committed himself very firmly in Madrid to solve and help to fight terrorism. So we're speaking of deep convictions that unite us.
So I want you all to know that President Bush has scrupulously met his commitment. And today, in a very fundamental support in the struggle against terrorism, and I, as President of the Government of Spain, as a Spaniard and as a friend, would like to thank him most especially.
The second thing I wanted to say is that the relationship between Spain and the United States is extremely solid, strong. It's firm, and we want it to be that way not only now but also in the future. And I think that it is based on a shared vision and on shared values, on many things— given one clear example, the most serious risk, perhaps, to us all, terrorism. But this relationship is based on firm belief in shared values and in principles that we defend and that we proclaim and that we assume.
And it's also based on something that is very important, in that commitments are met. And that's something these days is worth remembering, and that's the value of giving your word. When you give your word and you keep it, then that gives rise to trust and that, in turn, friendship. And that, I believe, is what serious countries and serious governments must do.
With regard to Iraq, that we've spoken about, I very much appreciate all the information that the President shared with me. Well, we've done, very simply, very normally, what we had to do. But today, we confront the future with optimism from a founded hope for the Iraqi people in freedom. Having won freedom for the Iraqis is the best hope we can sow for Iraq's future. And we want a democratic Iraq in which the Iraqis may decide their own future, they can be—have their own future in their own hands, and naturally, that they can live in freedom.
That is something that Spain is committed to, to Iraq's reconstruction. And we will, naturally, cosponsor with our friends and partners, the United States, Great Britain, the new resolution that the Security Council may take on sanctions.
Yesterday, I told Secretary-General Kofi Annan that sanctions had to be lifted. And I believe it should be done as quickly as possible, because they've lost their reason to exist. And with that resolution we will also be meeting one of the commitments of the Azores, and that is defining the central role of the United Nations in the process.
One last consideration regarding the Middle East, Israelis, Palestinians, the starting out of the roadmap is the expression of a firm political commitment of all of us and the expression of President Bush's firm political commitment. That opens up possibilities—because after the situation in Iraq, now many possibilities opened up— but it also opens up responsibilities. Everyone has to meet their responsibilities, and we very highly value the steps taken by the Palestinian Authority. We wish Abu Mazen success. And we will actively cooperate so as to sow the relationship between Israelis and Palestinians with coexistence, peace, and hope.
Thank you very much, Mr. President.
President Bush. Dos preguntas por lado. Tom [Tom Raum, Associated Press].
U.S. Action on Iraqi Reconstruction
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. How are you doing in getting a resolution put together to win the support of some of the critics on the Security Council, namely Russia and France? And is the United States prepared to ignore the sanctions if the June 3d deadline comes and it's necessary?
And to Mr. President Aznar, what will you be able to do to help win the speedy vote you talked about? And do you find that public opinion at home is making it harder for you to make such a case?
President Bush. You want to translate? He managed to violate a rule. He asked two questions instead of one question. But that's okay. He's been around a long time. Yes, listen, we have—we discussed the resolution today. We believe there is a mood to work together to achieve a resolution that will expedite the reconstruction of Iraq. The read from at least our diplomats at the United Nations is that the kind of— the atmosphere that existed prior to the war has changed and that people now want to work together for the good of the Iraqi people. I think Jose Maria shares that sentiment.
President Aznar. Absolutely. I hope it's true. For our part, the position I've maintained is a clear one, and everyone needs to contribute to it within the Security Council. And it's all about the Iraqi people, so I hope we're successful.
Death of Spanish Journalists in Iraq
Q. Well, President Bush, you have expressed your condolences because of the death of the two Spanish journalists in Iraq. My question would be, do you think this was a mistake, firing against the Palestine Hotel, under which fire Jose Couso died? And if so, would you apologize, do you think it's necessary to apologize before the Spanish Government and the family of these journalists?
President Bush. I think war is a dangerous place, and I think that nobody would kill a journalist intentionally.
President Aznar. Well, the U.S. Government has already said that this was a mistake, and we believe this. I am truly, fully convinced that no one would intentionally fire against innocent victims, and in this case, the journalists who died. And that's all; that's it. The President has often expressed the pain that this produces and his condolences because of this. And I think that's clear enough.
President Bush. Steven [Steve Holland, Reuters].
President's Visit to the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln
Q. Mr. President, do you have any reaction to Senator Byrd's criticism of your aircraft carrier landing?
President Bush. Exactly—the fact that it was on the fourth hook?
Q. I guess that's it. No, I think the words were ""flamboyant showmanship.""
President Bush. Yes. No, listen, it was an honor for me to go on the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln. I appreciate the chance to thank our troops. It was an unbelievably positive experience. And not only was I able to thank our troops; I was able to speak to the country and talk about not only their courage but the courage of a lot of other men and women who wear our country's uniform. I'm glad I did it. It was also a really good landing.
U.S. Relations With Chile and Mexico
Q. The criticism is that—the criticism was made of Chile and Mexico that they would not support the resolution in the U.N. Security Council, the war against Iraq. What is your opinion of this?
President Bush. They're friends of ours, period. We've got great relations with Mexico, and we'll continue to have great relations with Mexico. We've got an important free trade agreement with Chile that we're going to move forward with.
President Aznar. For my part, I have to say that in addition to being our friends, they're family.
President Bush. Thank you all."
"January 12, 2004","The President's News Conference With President Vicente Fox of Mexico in Monterrey, Mexico",George W. Bush,"George W. Bush, The President's News Conference With President Vicente Fox of Mexico in Monterrey, Mexico Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/213160",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-vicente-fox-mexico-monterrey-mexico,"President Fox. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. President Bush, welcome to Mexico, and welcome to Monterrey. We receive you with great enthusiasm, the way we are receiving the leaders of the countries of America. We have great expectations in order to work in this extraordinary Summit of the Americas.
In order to know each other better— all of us leaders that have responsibilities in America—it's best to analyze extraordinary matters that have been brought about in the last few years, since the last meeting of the Americas. While checking and making a revision on these matters, we can give broad solutions to the problems—economic and poverty problems in a great part of the continent; perhaps solutions to the problems of human capital, social capital in our respective countries; and likewise deal, as we have been doing in every single meeting, the safety and security matters, going deep inside the problems of corruption, making sure that in our countries, democracy should be there and the state of law should be there. So this meeting will enable us to give steps forward in all these multilateral topics.
Likewise, we have had a bilateral meet-ing—and I will mention this later on, a couple of matters, important matters in reference to this bilateral conversation. First of all, relating to the migration topic, President Bush has given us in full detail and has told us once again the proposal made in the United States for the migration matters and the policy that should be checked upon that—that topic. It's a sovereign matter of the United States.
Consequently, this migration proposal is analyzed according to the different conversations that President Bush and President Fox, myself, even when he was a Governor in the State of Texas and I was a Governor in the State of Guanajuato. Since that time, we have been touching upon this subject, and we did that in the first meeting in Rancho San Cristobal in the State of Guanajuato. We did it once again, and we spoke about migration. We have been doing this in each one of the different meetings.
So I would like to give full acknowledgement that part of the conversations, a great part of the conversations have been collected and analyzed. But this is a proposal made by the President of the United States. We totally agree and are aware that the proposal should be discussed, broadly discussed, analyzed, particularly in the Congress of the United States. Consequently, we should give full time so that the idea— well, the idea should mature, and it should definitely be approved.
So for us in Mexico, this is a very important step forward on what has to do with the relationship between the two countries, on what has to do with the migration flow. It is a topic with a great priority for our countries, for both countries. This proposal opens an opportunity to have a certain movement, a certain situation, important for many millions of Mexicans. It is a priority. It is a valuable proposal, and by all means, it will have to do with the improvement of the situation of these migrants, but it will have to do as well with the strengthening of our respective economies—that on the one hand.
On the other, the topic that we have been dealing with is the initiative of North America, by means of which both Governments want to work with very specific objectives so as to create a greater economic growth, increase productivity and competitiveness within the region through the reduction of costs, and facilitating trade flows, promoting development of common markets in different specific sectors. And it has as an objective to establish a security regional framework protecting Mexico, the United States, and Canada from terrorism.
Several tables, working tables, analyze the normalization of different standards within the market in automobiles, food, agriculture products, construction materials, and consumption goods. Likewise, there's a table that has to do with trade and services. Another one is working on energy; another one in scientific and technological cooperation; another one, regional cooperation on trade and investment. Consequently, it is a great effort so as to achieve the objectives that I just mentioned.
President Bush, once again, thank you for visiting us. Thank you for being here. This summit, this meeting, will allow us to be near the different Presidents, the different leaders of Latin America, the Caribbean area, Central America, and by all means North America. And it will be for the good of this continent in the future. Thank you.
President Bush. Thank you, Mr. President. Laura and I are—really appreciate your hospitality. We want to thank you and Marta for being our friends. I remember well our visit to your ranch. And to this end, we would like to extend an invitation to both you and the First Lady of Mexico to visit our ranch on March the 5th and 6th. I hope you can find—I hope it's a convenient date for you on your calendar because we'd love to have you there.
The bonds of friendship and shared values between our two nations are strong. We have worked together to overcome many mutual challenges, and that work is yielding results. Today, Mexico is America's second largest trading partner, and we are Mexico's largest. Every day, thousands of Americans and Mexicans cross the border in both directions for reason of commerce and tourism. And many Americans settle— many Mexicans settle in America, bringing with them optimism and a strong desire to succeed. They come to fulfill their dreams, and in the process they enrich our Nation.
Last week, I proposed a new temporary-worker program that will help further the cause of safe, legal, and orderly migration. This temporary-worker program will match willing foreign workers with willing American employers when no Americans can be found to fill the jobs. Under this program, undocumented workers currently in the United States will be able to come out of the shadows and establish legal identities. All participants in the program will be issued a temporary-worker card that will allow them to travel back and forth between their home and the United States without fear of being denied reentry into our country.
This plan is not amnesty, placing undocumented workers on the automatic path of citizenship. I oppose amnesty because it encourages the violation of our laws and perpetuates illegal immigration. My proposal expects that most temporary workers will eventually return permanently to their home countries when the period of work that I will be negotiating with the Congress has expired. And I think it's important to give financial incentives to those workers in order for them to make the decision to return home permanently.
I'll work with President Fox and other leaders on a plan to give temporary workers credit in their home countries' retirement systems for the time they worked in the United States. I support making it easier for temporary workers to contribute a portion of their earnings to tax-preferred savings accounts, money they can collect as they return to their native countries.
Under this program, the United States will benefit from the honest labor of foreign workers. Our neighbors will benefit as productive citizens return home with money to invest and to spend in their own nation's economy. This program will be more humane, humane to workers, and will live up to the highest ideals of our nations.
While my Nation benefits from the dreams that newcomers bring to America, I believe that people should be better able to achieve their dreams at their own home. The best way in the long term to reduce the pressures that create illegal immigration is to expand economic opportunity in countries at both ends of an immigrant's journey. This is why President Fox and I are committed to free and fair trade. We've seen it lift both our nations and our economies. Since 1994, trade between our two countries has grown from $100 billion to $232 billion. We will continue to work together and with Canada to enhance North American prosperity and security.
We're also working to reduce the cost of sending money home to families and local communities. These remittances exceed $10 billion per year. But the cost of such transfers reduces the amount of money that hardworking people can return to their families. Our two countries have made it a priority to keep hard-earned money in the hands of those who need it most. In recent years, our efforts under our U.S.-Mexico Partnership for Prosperity Initiative have reduced the cost of remittances by almost 60 percent.
Two years ago, in this city, world leaders agreed on a vision to expand opportunity and spread prosperity throughout the hemisphere. With this year's Special Summit, we continue to put that vision into action. Through the Inter-American Development Bank, we are expanding access to credit for small-business entrepreneurs, the key engines of growth and job creation for any nation's economy. We're helping nations improve their legal systems to protect property rights so that owners can use their property as collateral to finance the purchase of a home or to start a business. We're investing in the health and education of our peoples, and we're intensifying our common fight against corruption.
President Fox and I will also continue our efforts to support democracy in the region. We will work with the Organization of American States to ensure the integrity of the Presidential recall and referendum process underway in Venezuela. And as part of our effort to protect the institutions of democracy in Bolivia, we will cochair the initial meeting of the Bolivia Support Group in Washington this coming Friday.
Our bilateral relationship is strong. This summit's agenda is full. The United States will continue to work with our friends in the neighborhood in a spirit of common purpose and mutual respect.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Temporary-Worker Program/Airport Security
Q. Question for both of you. President Fox, once more on migrating matters, what else did the Mexican Government propose? What else can we expect for the Mexican workers? Can we aspire the same treatment of the Canadian ones without any approaches? What are the purposes in reference to migrants? Does this have election purposes? And will the United States avoid violating the human rights in our airports? What is the question, and the question is addressed for both Presidents. Thank you.
President Fox. First of all, I would like to say, what else can we wish? What we want is the plan presented by President Bush. We hope that the plan has a happy ending, through the political process that should be followed within the United States so that it can be approved in the Congress of the United States.
I would say that this is what we want. The plan, as it was mentioned before, is a very important step forward for many Mexican workers in the United States. Those that have the direct benefit of this will recognize and acknowledge this proposal that has a great importance for them. Not only because they can see that their labor rights and their human rights are completely respected there but there is a human face on this proposal, a human face that has to do with the families of these workers. Consequently, for us it is a plan that meets the demands and its measures. And our will should be to support the plan to be achieved and go on.
In reference to safety matters on the airports and the flights, that is a sovereign decision in Mexico to implement these safety and security programs within the airports and within the Mexican airlines. So we are not violating any human right of any sort of citizen. What we're doing is paying special attention so as to avoid terrorist acts, violent acts within the Mexican territory or within the Mexican airlines.
And in this same approach, we mention that there's no direct intervention of no official personnel, policemen, agents—direct intervention, direct participation in operations that have to do with the assurance of this task within the Mexican airports or within the Mexican airlines. What we do have is a participation and an exchange with the personnel, the liaison personnel, the link personnel for security. We exchange information so as to do our work much better.
We reject any other sort of information, different information that has been brought about that in these activities—well, we can state that only Mexican personnel participates, agents of the airlines or agents of security here in Mexico. Thus, there is no intervention in the direct operation of any other official agent from abroad. It is the liaison officers, the link offices; we exchange information the way we agreed upon with President Bush since the beginning of our conversations in Rancho San Cristobal.
And we have a mutual trust—that's the way we started—so that the security and safety institutions would trust each other, they could have an exchange of information, and they could be very, very efficient in their work. Never, never before had we reached efficiency level fighting organized crime, guaranteeing the security and safety of the different passengers, stopping, let's say, loads of drug, drug trafficking the way we have been achieving this in the last few years, based upon mutual trust and based on this coordinated work between the two parts.
President Bush. Mr. President, I appreciate your wonderful cooperation that we've achieved between our two countries. You've just articulated that level of cooperation in a way that I don't think I ever could. So that's my answer to the second question you asked.
My answer to the first question you asked is that I proposed this change in immigration law because I think it is the right thing to do. It recognizes the reality of our country. The President and I talked about whether or not—the ramifications of this initiative to Mexico. But the migration policy applies to all foreign workers. But the truth of the matter is, the vast majority of foreign workers in America are from Mexico. We know that in Texas very well. And I repeat to you that this is—these workers are a benefit to my country. These are hard-working, decent, honorable people that are in our country because—to fill jobs that others won't take, on the one hand, and also to make a living, to put money— to get money and to send money back to their families. There is a deep human desire for a mother or a father to provide for his or her family. And that's how I view the motivations of good, decent Mexican citizens working in our country.
And it seems like to me, it makes sense to have laws that treat people with respect. We are a country of law. Rule of law is important in America. And therefore, we ought to not have a system that is based upon a undocumented underclass but a system that is based upon law.
And so I—you said something about politics—yes, there's politics involved. But the reason I made—and there will be politics probably involved in whether or not it passes Congress. But the reason I proposed the initiative is because it is the right thing for America to do.
Iraq
Q. Thank you, Mr. President, President Fox. My question is about Iraq. The death toll in Iraq, the American death toll, is approaching 500. I wonder whether you have any reservations now about whether that toll is worth it to achieve your objectives in Iraq and the Middle East.
President Fox, you had a disagreement with the President going into the war. I wonder whether you aired that out during your meeting just now, whether you now see eye-to-eye on postwar Iraq. Thank you.
President Bush. A democratic, free Iraq is in the national interests of our country. A free country in the midst of the Middle East will make America more secure and, matter of fact, make any country more secure. And the decision I made was a tough decision.
We've had discussions prior to the decision and after the decision. Vicente Fox is a good enough friend for him to be able to express his opinion to me without the loss of friendship, and he didn't agree with the decision I made. But the decision I made was the right one for America, and history will prove it's the right one for the world. And we will stay the course until the job is done.
And the job is getting done. Iraq is more free every day. The citizens are begin-ning—the lives of the citizens are improving every day. And one thing is for certain, there won't be any more mass graves and torture rooms and rape rooms. The tyrant will no longer come back to threaten the Iraqi people. These people will be able to live in—these Iraqi citizens will not only be able to live in a free society; they'll be able to live in a society that is free from one of the most brutal dictators in the world's history.
President Fox. As a democratic nation, to meet the challenge of terrorism, to make sure that terrorism is eradicated from the face of this world—that's our challenge today, and that's what we work on. It is why we congratulate the U.S. Government that they withheld Saddam Hussein, and he will be taken to trial, to judgment. We fully support that, and we congratulate President Bush and the United States for that very important accomplishment, which is for the better of all nations, all families, all people in the world that would want to live in peace without terrorism.
Free Trade Agreements
Q. Good afternoon. My question is addressed for both Presidents, if you can really talk about a free trade agreement—[inaudible]—North America, between Mexico, United States, and Canada, in the midst of all the problems of commercial exchange such as transportation, food, agricultural sector. Second question: Can you achieve a free trade agreement of the Americas with the opposition of many countries such as Brazil and Venezuela?
President Fox. Well, in the case of a free trade agreement of North America, we have clearly pointed out many a time that it has been successful for Mexico. We are very much satisfied with what has been achieved in the last 10 years. Mexico is the ninth economy in the world. It has enabled Mexico to have the size of the seventh power for exports in the world and a per capita income going beyond, let's say, $6,000, the highest in Latin America. These are things that have been brought about because of this relation that has been established. And we have worked upon that for 10 years.
I read a report of the ILO about Latin America and unemployment and wages and salaries of the different workers. And Mexico has the best, let's say, rate on unemployment in Latin America, improving the situation, improving the actual wages of the workers in Latin America—the only one in Latin America. And by all means, this is coming from the free trade agreements. Consequently, we are satisfied with the free trade agreement, and it should continue operating and working with success.
On a parallel basis, we have thought about the Initiative of North America to thrust and develop our economies much more, achieving competitiveness and productivity, generating jobs and quality of life in our respective countries. It is a parallel, an additional pathway.
And as President Bush already mentioned in reference to the Association for Prosperity—the document known as Partnership For Prosperity, that's the name of the document—it has many—[inaudible]— we work day by day so as to thrust and improve the document. So we're giving steps forward in this direction—that on the one hand.
On the other, as a consequence of this, Mexico is a passionate promoter of the free trade agreements in the Americas. We are totally in favor of the free trade agreement for the American Continent, by all means. And we're working in favor and working actively so that it will be achieved as soon as possible. We received with great satisfaction the results of the last meeting in Miami, Florida, where the agreement is to continue building this free trade agreement so as to have it ready on the foreseen dates that we thought about. So we are working enthusiastically in this field.
By all means, we do not only want a free trade agreement but we want a very good free trade agreement, an agreement with quality and that has to do with trade that would take development to the less developed countries, the poorest countries in our continent, that could take development to the different regions where there's greater poverty in our continent. And that is the fundamental purpose of this agreement.
Trade promotes development, undoubtedly. Trade undoubtedly promotes the reduction of poverty. And trade and relations amongst countries promote human capital. So we are absolutely in favor of trusting and supporting this agreement.
President Bush. It's helped America; it's helped Mexico; it's helped Canada. I think we need to move the process forward— the President and I discussed that earlier today—with the North American Initiative.
The President is absolutely right. The best way to eradicate poverty is to encourage trade between nations. Trade gives people hope and provides opportunity. Obviously, that must be coupled with anticorruption measures, like the President has done here in Mexico. It must be coupled with good education measures. At this meeting, we're going to talk about ways to get capital into the hands of the entrepreneurial classes of respective countries. But without trade, there's going to be— it's going to be hard for some people to find opportunity.
And so I hope those who have expressed some opposition about the free trade agreement of the Americas look at the facts. And the fact is that NAFTA has lifted lives and ended poverty in some parts of our— in our neighborhood. And to this end, the United States will not only push for the free trade agreement of the Americas; we will continue trade agreements with countries like Chile—we just concluded one with Chile—but with the Central American countries, Andean countries. We believe in trade. We believe it's in the interest of the neighborhood that we trade freely.
Paul O'Neill
Q. Thank you, President Fox. President Bush, is it true, as your former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill says, that you started planning for the invasion of Iraq within days of your inauguration? Do you feel betrayed? And should he have released those documents?
President Bush. First, let me say I appreciate former Secretary O'Neill's service to our country. We worked together during some difficult times. We worked together when the country was in recession, and now we're coming out of recession, which is positive news. We worked together when America was attacked on September the 11th, which changed how I viewed the world. September the 11th made me realize that America was no longer protected by oceans and we had to take threats very seriously, no matter where they may be materializing.
And no, the stated policy of my administration towards Saddam Hussein was very clear. Like the previous administration, we were for regime change. And in the initial stages of the administration, as you might remember, we were dealing with Desert Badger or fly-overs and fly-betweens and looks, and so we were fashioning policy along those lines. And then, all of a sudden, September the 11th hit. And as the President of the United States, my most solemn obligation is to protect the security of the American people. That's my—to me that's the most solemn thing an American President or any President must do. And I took that duty very seriously.
And as you know, not only did we deal with the Taliban, we gave—working through the United Nations and working through the international community, we made it clear that Saddam Hussein should disarm. And like he had done with a lot of previous resolutions, he ignored the world's demands. And now he's no longer in power, and the world is better for it. The Iraqi people are better for it; America is better for it; Mexico is better for it. The world is more peaceful as a result of Sad-dam Hussein not being in power.
And the task at hand, Mr. President— and he and I—he knows this fully well— is to make sure that the aspirations of the Iraqi people are allowed to flourish. And we'll get there. It's a tough task right now. It's hard work, but we've done hard work in the past. And a free Iraq is going to be in the world's interest.
Thank you very much.
President Fox. Thank you, Mr. President. Good afternoon."

Hola. Que tal? Bienvenidos.
President Fox. Gracias.
President Bush. Mr. President, Laura and I are pleased to welcome you and Marta to Crawford. I was honored as my first trip abroad as President to accept your invitation to your home in San Cristobal. We've met many times since. Today I'm pleased to host you here at our ranch.
Mexico and the United States are more than neighbors. We are partners in building a safer, more democratic, and more prosperous hemisphere. In this age of terror, the security of our borders is more important than ever, and the cooperation between Mexico and American border and law enforcement is stronger than ever.
Through the Border Partnership Agreement, our two nations are improving the infrastructure at ports of entry along our common border. We're using technology to allow law-abiding travelers to cross the border quickly and easily, while officials concentrate on stopping possible threats. Our Mexican and American officials are working together to arrest dangerous criminals, including drug smugglers and those who traffic in human beings. President Fox and I are determined to protect the safety of American people and the Mexican people.
President Fox and I are continuing our efforts to support democracy in the region. I support the President's help in bringing order and stability to Haiti. As our efforts move forward, I welcome Mexico's further support.
Our two nations will continue to cochair the Bolivia Support Group to protect the institutions of democracy in that country. We will work with the Organization of American States to help ensure the integrity of the Presidential recall and referendum process underway in Venezuela.
I am committed to working with President Fox to expand free and fair trade between our nations. We've seen trade lift both our nations and both our economies. Over the past decade, trade between the United States and Mexico has nearly tripled to about $230 billion. Today, Mexico is America's second-largest trading partner, and we are Mexico's largest.
We will continue to work together and with Canada to enhance our common prosperity. Selling American goods and services in foreign markets is vital to the American economy. Selling our products abroad creates jobs for America. We must reject economic isolationism. There is no future in walling America off from the rest of the world. American workers and families, no less than the people of Mexico and the people of all nations, benefit from free and fair trade.
We will work to ensure a system of safe and orderly migration. Earlier this year, I proposed a temporary-worker program, not an amnesty program, that will offer legal status as temporary workers to undocumented men and women who were employed in the United States when I announced this proposal.
Under this program, America will also welcome workers from foreign countries who have been offered jobs by American employers that no American has filled. I oppose amnesty, placing undocumented workers on the automatic path to citizenship. This program will match willing workers with willing employers without disadvantaging those who have followed the law and waited in line to achieve American citizenship.
This new temporary-worker program will strengthen both the American and Mexican economies. The United States will benefit from the labor of hard-working immigrants. Mexico will benefit as productive citizens are able to return home with money to invest and spend in their Nation's economy.
This system will be more humane to workers, who will be protected by labor laws and able to establish their identities. It will live up to the highest ideals of free nations.
Mr. President, thank you for the excellent dialog we had today. Thank you for the leadership you provide for our neighbor and friend. And thank you for being a friend to Laura and me. Bienvenidos.
President Fox. Good morning. I would like to thank the President and his wife, Mrs. Laura Bush, for inviting us here to spend some time with them here at the ranch at Crawford, some time for friendship and some time for hard work.
We have a long tradition of relationships and meetings with Presidents Bush and Fox, starting with the meeting in the ranch at San Cristobal, where we developed a work agenda. We spoke—both Presidents continue to review, looking forward to what lies ahead.
We know the value of the open relationship, commercial relationship, and the impact that it has had on both these nations and the unprecedented levels of prosperity that it brings to our people. It's a two-way street, a two-way commercial street. It's a buying and selling operation.
I would like to point out that Mexico buys from U.S., the United States, in volumes that equal the volumes of Germany, Spain, Italy, and France. All of this creates employment. And that's why we continue to revise the commercial agenda, and we can see that things are going well in this direction.
Immigration is a subject that is of shared responsibility between both our nations. But we have a shared definition about immigration. We have to work together to develop a legal system that is orderly and safe and respects the dignity of those involved. It is clear to us that the people who come to this country make a significant contribution to the American economy. And I underline the fact that I refer to those who are working to contribute to the economy.
And that is why we welcome President Bush's proposal that he made in January. And that is why, in our meetings, we worked to advance this proposal, and that's what we have been doing today. We welcome the news that was confirmed today with regard to visitors to the U.S. from Mexico. We recognize the value to those who come to the United States to work, to study, to contribute. And we appreciate what this will do to the flow of visitors now that they will not have to be photographed or fingerprinted at the frontier for short visits to the United States. We appreciate what that will do to the flow of people coming to this country.
The other good news this year is the— about the NAFTA visa for professionals, that allows professionals to come and work in either country and contribute to both.
We also appreciate the recent visit of Secretary Ridge, talking about the cooperation in security between our countries. And we understand that this is progressing well and we have a solid and good basis to move forward, always respecting the security issues that are essential to both countries. We have spoken about competition and productivity and jobs. In order to allow the initiative of the United States, together with Canada, this will allow us to protect jobs in the region and, through the North American Initiative, contribute to the economies and to the workforce on both sides of the border.
In the fields of energy and industrial products, food products, sanitation systems, and systems for the protection of food products, the contributing opportunities for businesses, these are all subjects which are moving forward well. And we look forward to agreements with Canada in the near future that will contribute to the North American Initiative, which will benefit the three nations in this region.
Then in the area of the international relations, specifically in the Caribbean, we have been revising our joint efforts in that area. And we will continue to work in the areas of Haiti and Venezuela, Bolivia, and others in the region to promote democracy and human development and sustainable economic systems.
Thank you.
President Bush. How many questions, Scott? Two questions? Dos preguntas por cado lado.
Jennifer [Jennifer Loven, Associated Press].
National Economy
Q. Thank you, sir. Senator Kerry has been hitting you pretty hard on job growth. And yesterday's report gave his arguments a little bit more traction. Can you tell the American people why they shouldn't listen to his arguments and vote for you?
President Bush. The economy is getting stronger. We've overcome a lot. We've been through a recession. We've been through an attack. We've been through corporate scandals. We've been through war. And yet our economy is getting stronger. And the question is, who brings forth the best progrowth policies? You've heard us talk about the advantages of trade. This Nation must reject economic isolationism. We need less regulation. We need tort reform. We need to make sure the tax cuts are permanent. Raising taxes will make it harder for people to find work. We've got a pro-growth, pro-entrepreneur, pro-small-business agenda that is making this economy stronger.
Do you want to translate that? Okay. You don't have to. [Laughter]
[At this point, a translation was provided.]
President Bush. Make sure you tell them: Don't raise taxes. [Laughter]
[A translation was provided.]
President Bush. Like some others want to do.
[A translation was provided.]
President Bush. Okay, thank you. [Laughter]
[President Fox spoke in Spanish, and no translation was provided.]
President Bush. Blame it on me. [Laughter]
Corporate Responsibility
[A question was asked in Spanish, and no translation was provided.]
President Bush. Si, si. I understand. Comprendo.
First of all, President Fox has made it very clear that democracy and transparency and rule of law are integral values of Mexico. And where there is corruption, there will be law and justice, no matter who is responsible. And that is a commitment of this President, and it's a commitment I share because in our own country we've had corporate scandals. And what's important in both countries is to deal with these issues through rule of law and to hold people to account when they're guilty of betraying the trust.
Who do you want, Scott? Okay, how are you?
Q. Hi.
President Bush. Welcome. Pelo roja. [Laughter]
September 11
Q. Mr. President, some firefighters and families of the 9/11 victims—of the 9/11 victims want you to pull your campaign ad focusing on the tragedy. Are you prepared to honor their wishes?
President Bush. First of all, I will continue to speak about the effects of 9/11 on our country and my Presidency. I will continue to mourn the loss of life on that day, but I'll never forget the lessons. The terrorists declared war on us on that day, and I will continue to pursue this war. I have an obligation to those who died. I have an obligation to those who were heroic in their attempts to rescue, and I won't forget that obligation.
How this administration handled that day as well as the war on terror is worthy of discussion. And I look forward to discussing that with the American people. And I look forward to the debate about who best to lead this country in the war on terror.
Por fin.
Immigration Policy
[A question was asked in Spanish.]
President Bush. Vamos a ver. Vamos a ver. Go ahead, want to translate? To make sure I got all of it.
Interpreter. The question is on the immigration policy. The Government of Mexico wanted to know what the date certain would be for this new program or what proposals you have for temporary immigrants, and how do you believe it will affect the upcoming election process?
President Bush. Well, we just—the President just discussed the border crossing cards, the issue of the border crossing cards, and he discussed the professional visas. And so we're making progress.
I put forth what I think is a very reasonable proposal and a humane proposal, one that is not amnesty but in fact recognizes that there are good, honorable, hard-working people here doing jobs Americans won't do. And I certainly hope the Congress takes this issue up. But there's no telling what's going to happen in an election year, so it's very difficult to give a date. The date that matters to me is the date in which I laid out what I think is a reasonable plan, which was in January.
Mr. President, thank you.
President Fox. Gracias.
President Bush. Thank you all. Enjoy the rest of your day.
Attorney General Ashcroft
Q. Any word on John Ashcroft?
President Bush. I talked to him last night.
Q. How is he?
President Bush. He sounded groggy but optimistic that they'd get the pancreas settled down.
Thank you."
"March 23, 2005","The President's News Conference With President Vicente Fox of Mexico and Prime Minister Paul Martin of Canada in Waco, Texas",George W. Bush,"George W. Bush, The President's News Conference With President Vicente Fox of Mexico and Prime Minister Paul Martin of Canada in Waco, Texas Online by Gerhard Peters and John T.

Thank you all for coming. It's my honor to welcome two friends to Baylor University. First, I want to thank the Baylor University family for providing these facilities for us. Your hospitality is awesome.
I appreciate the meetings we just had. Our relationships are important today. We intend to keep our relationships strong. Our relationships will be equally important for the years to come.
And so we had a good discussion about prosperity and security. And it turns out the two go hand in hand. It's important for us to work to make sure our countries are safe and secure, in order that our people can live in peace as well as our economies can grow. We've got a lot of trade with each other, and we intend to keep it that way. We've got a lot of crossings of the border. I intend to make our borders more secure and facilitate legal traffic.
We've got a lot to do. So we charged our ministers with the task of figuring out how best to keep this relationship—these relationships vibrant and strong. And I appreciate the commitment of the Prime Minister and the President toward a spirit of partnership to outlast whatever politics may occur; that puts in place a firm commitment to markets and democracy and freedom and trade and mutual prosperity and mutual security.
And so I want to welcome our friends. After we go through this exercise of democracy—that being answering your questions—I'm looking forward to hosting them to the ranch for a little lunch and a further discussion. We'll be spending time talking about the neighborhood, the countries in our region, and how best we can work together to make sure that democracy is firmly a part of the future of this neighborhood of ours.
And so, Mr. President, welcome. The podium is yours, sir.
President Fox. Thank you very much, President Bush. I want to also extend a greeting to Prime Minister Paul Martin and my gratitude for this wonderful reception, for this wonderful facility here at Baylor University, and, of course, my gratitude to the authorities here in Waco, the venue of this important event.
Today we have met to hold a very important encounter that has to do with the future of our nations. In the last decade, trade between our countries, the flows of investment, of the creation of jobs have held a good pace. And these efforts have been successful thanks to NAFTA. This bilateral cooperation, this trilateral cooperation has now become strengthened, and it has expanded. But above all, we are making progress on a daily basis toward greater understanding, toward greater knowledge and greater cooperation between our three Governments and our three countries.
Through the Partnership for Security and Prosperity and the quality of life of North America, today we begin a new phase. We are in a world that is constantly changing and that demands that we meet the new challenges and opportunities. We also face new threats that carry a risk for our societies. But we also want to work toward the good performance of our economies. This is why my Government is working toward a true coordination with our partners in North America. We are seeking an objective balance between the concerns that have to do with security and those that have to do with having a good and agile flow of goods and people across the borders.
North America should be the most competitive region in the world. It should be the safest region in the world. And 10 years ago, we took a great step in that direction. As Governments, we are obligated to turn this objective into a permanent process, to continue taking steps forward. This Partnership for Security, this Partnership for Prosperity, for the quality of life can have no other objective beyond improving the quality of life, itself, and the development of our peoples and of our societies.
Today my friend from Canada, Mr. Paul Martin, and the President of the United States, George Bush, all of us feel proud to present this joint statement to you. It reflects a shared vision for North America that will be a framework for cooperation, for partnership between our Governments and nations.
Thank you.
Prime Minister Martin. Good afternoon. It's a real pleasure to be here in Texas and to stand with President Bush and President Fox as representatives of a strong North America. We represent three sovereign nations that have formed one of the most successful partnerships in the world.
That being said, we also recognize that we cannot be complacent. The world is not standing still. New economic powerhouses such as China and India are rising, and we face new opportunities, but we also face new challenges. And this requires a new partnership, stronger, more dynamic, one that is focused on the future. We are determined to forge the next generation of our continent's success. Now, that's our destination. The Security and Prosperity Partnership that we are launching today is the roadmap to getting there.
I'm going to be a little longer than you were, President Bush, because I've got to do this in two languages. [Laughter]
Here in North America, we have many achievements to celebrate. But we do know that we cannot be complacent. The world does not stand still. New opportunities present themselves, as well as new challenges, as well as threats. In a world in constant change, we need a renewed partnership, more strong, dynamic. And we must have a roadmap that will bring us there. The roadmap is the North American Partnership for Security and Prosperity, which we are starting today.
[At this point, Prime Minister Martin continued in English.]
[Inaudible]—ways to help our citizens with healthier, safer, and more productive lives; for good jobs, for higher income; as well as a secure continent, cleaner water, cleaner air.
One thing is very clear, and that is when we work together as countries to make North America safer and more competitive, then the fact is all of the continent and all of our citizens benefit from that collective achievement.
The partnership that we are starting today acknowledges the fact that in a modern world, the objectives of prosperity, security, and a better quality of life have never been as interdependent.
What we seek to do is to improve the competitiveness of our industries, expand consumer choice by cutting redtape. We want to eliminate regulations that are a nuisance, not a necessity. And we want to maintain the highest standards of health care and safety for our citizens. We want to pursue agreed approaches based on sound science that will help us avoid the risk of hidden protectionism and, some would advocate, in responding to BSE. And I want to thank President Bush; I want to thank President Fox for the support that they have shown. We look forward to the day in the future when, notwithstanding all of the lobbying, all the legal challenges, all of North America is open to our safe and high quality beef.
In terms of security, we understand that protecting our borders is a crucial checkpoint on the road to our collective prosperity. Our safe borders secure our people not only against terrorism, but they make possible a speedy flow of goods, services, and people and information among our three nations. And standing on the shoulders of the Smart Borders Initiative, we are making new investments in security and in defense spending. Quite simply, Canada is a full and forceful partner in building a secure North America.
We have agreed—and I've got a long list here, Mr. President, which I'm going to forgo, basically a long list of items that we have agreed that we will task our ministers to accomplish, and then we will hold them to account, as we will be held to account by our people. Let me just say that this great—that these measures involve everything from how do we deal with our borders, how do we deal with infectious diseases, and how do we deal with fresh water concerns like Devil's Lake, which I will be talking to you about over lunch.
Let me just say that when a public health risk emerges, we want our laboratory centers in Winnipeg, in Atlanta, and in Mexico City talking to each other. We want to improve our air and our water quality, and we also want to make NAFTA work. And what that means—and, again, this is something we'll be talking about—is that we want the decisions of our dispute settlement panels to be respected and implemented. We want to resolve our differences in a fair manner based on the rule of law. And I'll continue to press for the resolution of softwood lumber dispute, and I look forward to discussing means as to how we make this partnership work better.
Let me just say that we have committed as leaders to meet on a regular basis. We're going to do this to assess our progress.
The efforts deployed over the last decade have been fruitful. It is up to us now to meet the new challenges and to seize the new opportunities that present themselves to us.
Mr. President, the efforts of the past decade have been successful, but as we've said this morning, it now falls to us to respond to new challenges, to seize new opportunities. The Security and Prosperity Partnership is our commitment to do so together.
President Bush. Thank you, Paul. I appreciate that very much.
We'll now answer two questions a side. I'll start with Jennifer Loven [Associated Press].
Theresa Marie Schiavo
Q. Thank you, sir. Can you tell us what actions you support, since the Federal courts continue to decline to allow the reinsertion of Terri Schiavo's feeding tube? And have you discussed options, next steps with your brother the Governor of Florida?
President Bush. I have not discussed next steps with the brother—my brother, who is the Governor of Florida. I have looked at all options prior to taking the action we took last weekend in concert with Congress. And we felt like the actions taken with Congress was the best course of action. This is an extraordinary and sad case, and I believe that in a case such as this, the legislative branch, the executive branch ought to err on the side of life, which we have. And now we'll watch the courts make its decisions, but we looked at all options from the executive branch perspective.
Democracy in the Americas/Immigration Policy
Q. Mr. President Bush, many countries of Latin America in recent years have elected leaders from the left. What possibility do you see as far as the arrival of a leader from the left in Mexico in the future? And on security, how difficult is it for you to keep your national security policy in place when you have a border where terrorists can go through that border, according to your Cabinet? What do you think of those illegal crossings?
President Bush. I am pleased that there are democracies in our hemisphere. As a matter of fact, every country is a democracy except one, Cuba. And that's incredible progress. And I look forward to working with whomever the people of Mexico choose. The choices as to who will lead Mexico—or any other country—is not the choice of the United States President, the United States Government, or the United States people. It is the choice of the Mexican people. And I know the people of Mexico are proud of their democracy. I'm proud of the democratic traditions upheld by Vicente Fox.
In terms of the border, listen, we've got a large border. We've got a large border with Canada. We've got a large border with Mexico. There are some million people a day crossing the border from Mexico to the United States, which presents a common issue, and that is, how do we make sure those crossing the border are not terrorists or drugrunners or gunrunners or smugglers?
And I have told the President that we will—I will continue to push for reasonable, commonsense immigration policy with the United States Congress. It is an issue with which I have got a lot of familiarity. After all, I was the Governor of this great State for 6 years, and I dealt with this issue a lot, not only with President Fox's predecessor but with Governors of border States—Mexican border States, Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon. And I know what—I know the issue well. And I will continue to call upon Congress to be commonsensical about this issue.
And the basis of the policy is that if there is a job opening which an American won't do, in other words—and there's a willing worker and a willing employer, that job ought to be filled on a legal basis, no matter where the person comes from. That makes sense. We need a compassionate policy. In other words, if this is in place, then someone will be able to come and work from Mexico in the United States and be able to go home, back and forth across the border in a legal fashion. That seems to make sense to me. It's a commonsensical way of doing things.
I think we ought to have a policy that does not jeopardize those who've stood in line trying to become legal citizens. We want to reward those who have been patient in the process. There's plenty of Mexican citizens who have applied for citizenship. They should—their position in line should not be preempted because of— there's a worker program. But there's a better way to enforce our border, and one way is to be compassionate and decent about the workers who are coming here to the United States.
And, Mr. President, you've got my pledge: I'll continue working on it. You don't have my pledge that Congress will act, because I'm not a Member of the legislative branch. But you will have my pledge that I will continue to push our Congress to come up with rational, commonsense immigration policy.
Cooperation in North America
Q. Thank you, Prime Minister. A question to yourself and to President Bush and President Fox as well. You've been talking about cooperation, what you, Prime Minister, referred to as the new generation of success or the next generation of success. Keeping in mind, in front of us, the European Union, how much is this partnership a first step towards continental integration? If so, how far would you like to go? And can you give us some sort of a roadmap and perhaps give us a distinction between partnership and integration?
Prime Minister Martin. Well, what we're really talking about here is not a big bang; we're talking about big progress. And if you look at each of the areas in which we have tasked our ministers, based on the work that they have already done, that is precisely what is coming out of this meeting, and that's precisely why we want to be able to measure the success and hold people accountable for the targets that we have set.
So when you're talking about security, there's no doubt about the importance of the security of our borders, given the increase in Canada's defense budget, our ability to work together, that obviously we want to make sure that there is the greatest degree of coordination between our defense and our border sources.
In terms of the economy, getting rid of nuisance regulation, making sure that we have better rules of origin, essentially what we want to do is to make sure, given the threat that we face from rising economies elsewhere, but primarily in Asia—both the threats and an opportunity, by the way— that, in fact, North America is as strong and as competitive as it can possibly be. And there should be no restriction on that—quality of life, the environment, how we work together—so that essentially what we really want to do is to make very, very substantial progress and to make sure that we continue to do it, so that the forces of protectionism never take over North America and that we're as competitive as we can.
I just wanted to say that what we're trying to do is not a big bang; what we're truly seeking to do is major progress. And this is in the field of border security, for example, what we have done so far. We went even further, and now the Government of Canada is spending money on its borders and its defense. And we're going much further in terms of elimination of nuisance regulations so that Canada can be competitive in the United States as it is in Canada and Mexico, but also maintaining quality of life, environment, working together. That's what we're seeking to do.
President Fox. Thank you. I feel that the purpose that we have discussed today is clear. This is an objective that has been coming on for several months now as a result of an intense dialog. We are talking about a partnership—that is the key word, ""partnership""—a partnership for security and a partnership for prosperity, a partnership that is based on human capital and that aims to improve the quality of life. This is the key element of this new task that we have laid out for ourselves. We have built upon NAFTA's achievements. It is widely—the benefits of NAFTA are widely known, but now we find new challenges that demand that we take new actions. These actions are defined in the program that is being launched through these precise instructions that we have given our ministers, our working groups, and their instructions are to carry out these ideas in the next 90 days.
So we are going to work through several approaches, and our purposes are based on three pillars of this proposal. The three pillars are security, to address any threat that might arise from abroad, address internal threats. We need to address also the inefficiencies in the movement of people, merchandise, and goods. We must also look to join talent, strategy, and resources to improve North America's competitiveness with other countries and other regions of the world. We need a level of competitiveness that allows us to reach the objectives that we have laid out for ourselves.
We need to reduce the costs of doing trade. We have a lot of trade between our three countries, and we feel that we can still bring down the costs of trade much more, and that will allow the trade between our countries to increase even more. We think that the biggest challenge of the 21st century will have to do with human capital, investing in our people, investing in technology, and that is another thing that we are going to work on.
Moreover, we are partners in protecting the environment. We are partners to protect our natural resources. We are partners to protect the health of our people. And we are partners, too, in the broadest sense of the word. So that is the road that we have before us. We have a timeline, and we have responsibilities to carry out, and we will make sure that these things happen.
President Bush. The future of our three countries will best be served by establishing trade relations with the rest of the hemisphere. It's kind of the most logical extension of a vision that recognizes that common trading areas are going to be needed in order to maintain lifestyle, particularly as the Far East begins to emerge as strong competitors for capital and goods and services and markets.
We started to advance this idea in Quebec City, as a matter of fact, in 2001 with the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas. To me, that's the most practical extension of the recognition of the realities that we're all going to be facing as the 21st century evolves. In order to make sure that the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas has a chance to succeed, it is important to show the sovereign nations in South America that trade has worked amongst the three of us. NAFTA has been a success. All you've got to do is go down to the border of our State. If you could have gone down 10 years ago and gone down today, you would have seen a marked difference of quality of life on both sides of the border. I mean, it's been a very successful program in order to lift the standard of living in Mexico and the United States.
And I think when people see that we're willing to continue to work through issues—Canada, the United States, and Mexico—it may make it more palatable for countries to recognize the benefits of trade. So that the vision that you asked about in your question as to what kind of union might there be, I see one based upon free trade, that would then entail commitment to markets and democracy, transparency, rule of law.
To this extent, we have entered into an agreement with the Central American nations called CAFTA. I think—I know it's an important part of the prosperity agenda throughout the hemisphere, and I asked Congress to make sure that they approve CAFTA this year.
Thank you. Caren [Caren Bohan, Reuters].
Situation in North Korea
Q. Secretary Rice has made clear that the United States is growing impatient with North Korea's refusal to come back to the six-way talks. And there has been talk that the United States has a June deadline. What consequences would there be if they don't come back to the talks? And also, is China doing enough to keep the pressure on?
President Bush. Thank you for bringing up Secretary Rice. She just got back from her trip Monday evening and came down to Crawford yesterday to brief me on the trip. I'm grateful that she took time out of her schedule to come down and talk about not only the discussions she had with China but discussions she had with South Korea and Japan, the leaders of India and Pakistan. And she also went to Afghanistan, so she had an extensive trip. It was about a 2-hour briefing, I want you to know.
We didn't set deadlines. What we said is what we've said to North Korea, ""If you want to—if you want the way forward, if you want to be accepted by the world, if you want not to be isolated, get rid of your weapons programs."" And fortunately, it's not just the United States of America saying that. China says that. As a matter of fact, it was here at Crawford that Jiang Zemin, at the ranch, said that the foreign policy goal of the Chinese is for there to be no nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula. And Hu Jintao made that clear to Secretary Rice that that is still the objective of the Chinese Government, so we share an objective. We share a goal. The Japanese share that goal. The South Koreans share that goal. The Russians share that goal.
So we've got five nations saying the same thing to Korea—North Korea, and we'll continue saying it to North Korea. And I'm a patient person, and so are a lot of people that are involved in this issue. But the leader of North Korea must understand that when we five nations speak, we mean what we say. And there is a way forward, and I repeat, for Kim Chong-il. And it's his choice to make. We've made our choice. China has made its choice. The other countries have made their choices. And for the sake of peace and tranquility and stability in the Far East, Kim Chong-il must listen.
And so I am pleased with the report I got from the Secretary. I am pleased today that Hu Jintao and the Chinese Government expressed continued interest in this subject and understanding of the importance of the five of us working together to achieve the common objective that we have set out.
Immigration Reform/Energy
Q. Mr. Presidents and Mr. Prime Minister, I wanted to ask you what concrete actions do your Governments want to lay out in order to make this partnership a reality as far as energy markets, which is a very critical issue for all of our countries—energy markets? I also want to ask you, in this Security and Prosperity Partnership, when will you include the migratory— or immigration policy in this partnership? And, President Bush, I wanted to ask you about your opinion about those people who are hunting migrant people along the border.
President Bush. I'm against vigilantes in the United States of America. I'm for enforcing law in a rational way. That's why we've got a Border Patrol, and they ought to be in charge of enforcing the border.
We talked about migration, of course; we spent a lot of time talking about migration. We've got a big border with Canada, a big border with Mexico, and it's an important issue. But the issue on the borders is not just people; it's goods and services. And so the agreements we're talking about, the way to strengthen our relationships, of course, includes our border policy. And we'll continue to include border policy.
I forgot the other part of your three-part question. What's that—you have something else you asked? I can't remember what it was.
Q. About energy.
President Bush. Oh, energy, yes. Look, yes, we're using a lot of it, and we need to conserve better in the United States. We're dependent on energy from overseas, and we've got to become less dependent on energy from overseas. We appreciate the fact that Canada's tar sands are now becoming economical, and we're glad to be able to get the access toward a million barrels a day, headed toward 2 million barrels a day. And I want to thank—and that's, by the way, an advantage for open trade. The American people must understand that when there is open trade, it helps solve our energy deficiency.
But one thing we can certainly do is cooperate better on sharing technologies. Look, we're going to have to change our habits. We're going to have to develop a hydrogen-powered automobile. And we look forward to working together. We've got integrated automobile industries between the three of us. And someday, hopefully, our automobile industries in our respective countries will be on the leading edge of technological change when it comes to helping change the habits of our consumers.
We're going to need liquefied natural gas coming into our three countries and into our markets. And I look forward with the Presidents on how to develop more access to liquefied natural gas, which—and there's a lot of natural gas in the world. The question is, how do we economically get it to our respective markets?
I recently went and saw those developing zero-emission coal-fired plants. I think we spent about a billion dollars on what's called the FutureGen Project. Look forward to working with our respective countries on sharing technologies and how to move forward to come up with zero-emissions coal-fired plants.
And so there's a lot we can do and will do on energy. But there's no question the United States of America is hooked on foreign sources of energy. And I put forth a strategy to the United States Congress in 2001; they're still debating it, the issue. Now is the time to get a bill to my desk; this is the year. People see the prices of their gasoline rising at the pumps, and I am concerned, and the American people are concerned. And it's now time to implement the strategies that we laid out in legal—in the law.
But, no, this is a very important subject matter. Thank you for bringing it up. We spent a lot of time discussing it.
President Fox. As far as concrete actions, the first concrete actions are those that have to do with all of the topics addressed by this Partnership for Security and Prosperity and quality of life. And the first concrete actions are going to be a specific charge of 90 days to present detailed ideas at 12 different working groups, working tables that have to do with the general ideas that we are laying out here.
Another concrete action that we have agreed to is that the three Presidents feel that about halfway through this 90-day period of time, we need to be able to assess the direction, the pace, and the degree to which these issues are becoming a reality towards the end of those 90 days. We want to be sure to have that final report be complete with all of the detail necessary, with all of the vision necessary that the Presidents have laid out.
Concrete actions in this sense also have to do with a sector-by-sector analysis so that from these analyses, we can create a strategy sector by sector, perhaps third-generation strategies that go beyond anything we've done before to make the economies work well jointly; also concrete actions as far as security along the borders and especially in our territories. Specifically in Mexico, we want to ensure peace and tranquility for our society. We want to provide guarantee to our people that our security plans are working in every sense. Mexico has a very ambitious security package that starts with our southern border, with our brothers, friends, neighbors, and partners in Central America, where we also want to address the issue of security because, in the end, this has repercussions throughout North America.
Concrete action will be taken as far as quality of life issues, health, education. I repeat, we are going to write these down, write these objectives down in black and white and carry out—and have this plan well configured and consolidated within the next 90 days to make sure that it is feasible, because all of us have a sense of urgency. We want to make North America into the most competitive region in the world, and we can do it with actions in the fields of energy, education, technology, security, and through protecting our natural resources. This should serve to give us the level of competitiveness that we seek.
In effect, we discussed immigration. We discussed it as a trilateral issue. We discussed the issue of border crossings, and how we can protect our borders and be efficient along the border, and also how we can keep people from crossing who shouldn't be crossing and address the threats that our nations have faced. So this is something that we also look at jointly. And in the end, this also has to do with competitiveness, and it also has to do with reaching the objectives that we have for security and quality of life.
Prime Minister Martin. In terms of energy as—we all know of the tremendous capacity that exists within Mexico. President Bush has referred to the tar sands, which are a great, great opportunity. And in fact, the whole energy sector, I think, for all of us is a huge, huge opportunity in terms of our competitiveness with the rest of the world. But in addition to the tar sands, you've got our conventional sources. You've got the Beaufort, the Hull, the question of pipelines that eventually will be addressed.
But there are also other areas, renewables. The President talked about clean coal technology, as an example. Renewables are dependent upon technology. And we're putting a lot now into ","wind pump—into wind power. There is, in the province of Saskatchewan, a major project going on in terms of CO2 sequestration, which essentially will be a major factor in fighting— in the whole climate change issue, and tremendous opportunities for us using these new technologies.
But the other thing that I would like to highlight as well, in addition to nuclear, is Canada has great potential in terms of hydro-electricity—northern Manitoba, Quebec, Newfoundland, and Labrador, to simply only give you a couple of examples. And what we've got to do—especially looking at the failure of the electricity grid in North America a year ago—we've got to make sure that that grid is very, very sound. So the opportunities for cooperation are huge.
President Bush. The final question, Paul.
Canada-U.S. Relations
Q. My question is both to President Bush and Prime Minister Martin. You've had some very sharp differences with Canada in the past, especially on issues like missile defense. Has this strained relations? And is the door still open for Canada to join missile defense in the future, something you call fundamental to the defense of North America?
Prime Minister Martin. Our relationships are very, very strong and in a wide range of areas. And the fact that the three of us are meeting here today and that we have put out what is really quite an ambitious program that is going to be measurable, I think is an indication of that.
Are there differences of opinion? Of course there have; there have been throughout our history, and there will be in the future. On BMD, the file is closed. But our cooperation in terms of defense, in terms of our borders, in terms of the defense of our common frontiers, is very— is not only very clear but it is being accentuated. And I've got to take that one step further. The defense of North America is not only going to take place in North America. Canada is playing an increasing load, as an example—role in Afghanistan, and that's also part of the defense of North America.
So we're working together, and we're going to continue to work together increasingly in the whole way in which we establish a common security, in which we protect it, in our defense.
With respect to the shield, this is an issue that is closed. But in terms of capacity to work together, this is something where we have provided major budgetary increases, because we want to protect ourselves at home in Canada. We want to assume our responsibilities in North America at the border level, in the north, and with the oceans. But we must also say that Canada will accentuate its role in Afghanistan. That shows you to what extent the defense of North America is not only here in North America, but really that speaks of the necessity to bring the battle beyond our borders.
President Bush. It's interesting, ""sharp differences."" I guess that's—""sharp"" means kind of, if you think about what that means, that means maybe differences so that we can't have a positive relationship. I view them—look, we've got differences. I don't know if you'd categorize them as differences that would then prevent us from finding common ground. I don't view it that way. I can understand why people disagree with certain decisions I have made, but that doesn't prevent us from cooperating in intelligence sharing, for example.
You know, a lot is made about softwood lumber, and it's clearly a sensitive issue. I know it firsthand; I've heard it ever since I became elected President. People are frustrated that we haven't got it solved. I understand that. But think about all the trade we've got between our countries. And we've resolved a lot of issues in a positive manner, and we'll continue to resolve them. I mean, we had an issue with cows, and that is getting resolved. I'm amazed that we don't have more sharp—whatever you call them—disagreements because we're doing a lot together.
In other words, what I'm telling you is that I think the relationship is very strong and very positive. And just because somebody doesn't agree with our policy doesn't mean that we can't continue to have very positive relationships. The relationship with Mexico and the relationship with Canada are very important for the United States of America. And there's going to be disagreements and differences. And the fundamental question is, do we have the capacity to continue moving forward with the relationship? And the answer is, absolutely.
And I want to thank the leaders for coming. People of our respective countries will see how vital these relationships are. And I look forward to our ministers reporting back with concrete action. They will be held to account, you're right, Mr. Prime Minister—and look forward to saying to our respective peoples that—and making clear that the relationship between America, Canada, and Mexico is vital to our mutual prosperity, mutual health, and the benefit of our folks.
Thank you all for coming. Good to see you all."
"August 09, 2005","The President's News Conference in Crawford, Texas",George W. Bush,"George W. Bush, The President's News Conference in Crawford, Texas Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/213860",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-crawford-texas-0,"The President. Thank you all for coming. As you can see, my economic team has come to Crawford, and we've just finished a very interesting discussion about our economy and what we need to do to make sure economic growth remains strong. After this press conference, we'll go over to the house and have a lunch and give us a chance to continue our dialog.
But before I begin in my discussion about the economy, I do want to congratulate the Discovery crew. Commander Collins and the pilot of that crew, James Kelly, did a fantastic job of bringing the craft, and most importantly the folks aboard the craft, home safely to California this morning. It was a great achievement. It's an important step for NASA to—as it regains the confidence of the American people and begins to transition to the new mission we set out for NASA. So, congratulations, Commander Collins. It's quite an achievement.
The economy of the United States is strong, and the foundation for sustained growth is in place. The economic agenda is based on the fundamental trust that the American people make good decisions for themselves and for their families. And that's why my policies allow more Americans to keep more of what they earn, to have more control over their daily lives, from health care to education to their retirement. It makes sense to trust people with their own money.
I'm pleased to report that the strategy is working. The economy is growing faster than any other major industrialized country. Job growth is strong. We added over 200,000 new jobs in July. This country has added nearly 4 million new jobs since May of 2003. The unemployment rate is 5 percent, which is below the average of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Americans have more money in their pocket, and that's good news.
There's still some challenges to the economy, and it's important for the American people to know we understand there are challenges, and we're acting to meet them. First of all, we have a challenge when it comes to energy. Yesterday in New Mexico, I signed an energy bill. I'll repeat today what I said yesterday, and that is, this bill isn't going to lower people's gasoline prices overnight, but it is—the bill does lay out a strategy to help us conserve more, to produce more in environmentally friendly ways, to use renewable sources of energy, all aimed at protecting our economic security and national security. The more we diversify our—the energy sector, the less dependent we are on foreign sources of energy.
Secondly, we're opening up new markets. In order to keep this economy growing, we've got to make sure we have not only free trade, but fair trade. The CAFTA vote is an important vote because it opened up new markets for 44 million consumers. That's going to be good for our farmers and entrepreneurs and small-business people. We discussed the need to continue advancing free and fair trade at the—during the Doha round discussions that will be held in Hong Kong later this year.
In order to make sure the economy continues to grow, we've got to continue to work with Congress to reduce our deficit. The Federal deficit is projected to be $94 billion less than previously expected, and that's thanks to a combination of tax relief, which got our economy growing, and spending restraint. We're ahead of pace to cut the deficit in half by 2009. And it's very important for Congress, as they work on the appropriations bills, to adhere to the budgets that they passed so that we can continue to send the signals to people around the country that we're serious about being fiscally responsible with the people's money.
We need to have certainty in the Tax Code. That's why I strongly believe that the tax relief we passed must be permanent, the death tax repealed forever. And at the same time, I look forward to working with the Tax Reform Commission to develop a simpler code that's a fairer code and one that encourages economic growth.
In order to make sure this economy continues to grow, we got to do something about the lawsuits that are making it difficult for our entrepreneurs and small-business people. I had the honor of signing a class-action reform. Congress needs to pass asbestos reform as well as medical liability reform.
Medical liability reform will help make health care costs more affordable and health care more accessible for our folks. And that leads me to our understanding that rising health care costs are a potential burden on economic growth and certainly a burden on many of our families. One way to deal with the costs is to do something about the frivolous lawsuits that are running up the cost of medicine.
I signed a patient's safety bill which will help reduce costs and, as importantly, medical errors. The Congress should pass association health plans so that small businesses can pool risk and expand health savings accounts at the same time. In other words, association health plans will help small businesses; health savings accounts will help individual consumers, help our families, but help small businesses, as well, better afford health care.
And finally on Social Security, look, we— in order to make sure this economy continues to grow, we have got to deal with problems now, to solve problems now, before they place an undue restraint on our families and an undue restraint on the ability to grow our economy. And Social Security is a—is a liability that—it needs to be addressed now.
Now, senior citizens must understand when I talk about Social Security reform that nothing will change for you. You'll get your check. But your grandchildren and your children are paying payroll taxes in the system that will be broke by 2041. And it's time to fix the system. Congress needs to understand the gravity of the situation. We have a serious problem. And I believe good leaders are those who stand up and address problems and not pass them on and hope that somebody else will come up and solve the problem.
Part of the solution for Social Security is to make sure that the poor do not retire into poverty, to make sure that people get benefits that grow at least with the rate of inflation—that will be, the wealthier citizens get benefits growing at the rate of the cost of living, but poorer citizens should have their benefits go up by wage increases. And that reform alone will fix a lot of the solvency issue of Social Security.
And while we're fixing Social Security, I strongly believe younger workers ought to be allowed—given the chance to, given the opportunity to take some of their own money and set it aside in a personal savings account. And that will have two effects. One, it will increase savings throughout our society, which is important to economic growth and vitality. But more importantly, it will mean workers from all walks of life will be able to own an asset that they call their own and that the Government cannot take away.
And so we've had a wide-ranging discussion on these important problems and opportunities. We're confident about the future of the American economy because we're confident that the entrepreneurial spirit is strong here.
With that, I'll be glad to take a couple of questions from you. Yes, ma'am. That would be you, Deb [Deb Riechmann, Associated Press].
Iran
Q. Mr. President, on Iran, Iran is thumbing its nose at the United States and Europe by resuming their uranium conversion activities. So if Iran doesn't blink, what is the—does the United States want to see immediate referral to the Security Council and—for punitive sanctions? And if so, what should those sanctions look like?
The President. I appreciate that question. First of all, as you know, we have made strong steps. We've condemned strongly Iranians' attempt to develop any kind of program that would allow them to enrich uranium to develop a weapon. In other words, the Iranians said they were in compliance with certain international rules, and yet we found out they weren't in compliance of those rules. And so we're very deeply suspicious of their desires and called upon our friends in Europe, what's called the EU-3, Germany, France, and Great Britain, to lead the diplomatic efforts to convince the Iranians to give up their nuclear ambitions.
First of all, I want to applaud the EU-3 for being strong in their—in presenting a unified voice. Secondly, in terms of consequences if the Iranians continue to balk, we'll work with the EU-3. In other words, they're the lead negotiators on behalf of the free world, and we will work with them in terms of what consequences there may be. And certainly the United Nations is a potential consequence.
And I—just as I was walking in here, I received word that the new Iranian President said he was willing to get back to the table. Now, I don't want to put words in his mouth, and you're going to have to check that out before you print that in your story, but if he did say that, I think that's a positive sign that the Iranians are getting a message that it's not just the United States that's worried about their nuclear program, but the Europeans are serious in calling the Iranians to account and negotiating. I don't know if you've got that word or not. That's a positive development.
But we'll work with our friends on steps forward, on ways to deal with the Iranians if they so choose to ignore the demands of the world. It is important for the Iranians to understand that America stands squarely with the EU-3, that we feel strongly the Iranians need to adhere to the agreements made in the Paris accord, and that we will be willing to work with our partners on—in dealing with appropriate consequences should they ignore the demands.
Q. It sounds as if you're willing to give them more time to let this work out——
The President. Well, the man said he wanted to negotiate, and of course—again, we're working with the EU-3. They're the lead negotiators. In other words, our strategy has been all along to make—to work with Germany, France, and Great Britain in terms of sending a strong signal and message to Iran. And today it looked like that the new Iranian leader has heard that message. We'll have to watch very carefully, however, because, as I repeat, they have, in the past, said they would adhere to international norm and then were caught enriching uranium. And that's dangerous. We don't want the Iranians to have a nuclear weapon.
The positive news, Deb, is, is that the world, at least the people we deal with— the Europeans, for example—are very— were knitted up in terms of the goal, and that is to prevent the Iranians from having a nuclear weapon.
Patsy [Patricia Wilson, Reuters].
Iranian Civilian Nuclear Program/North Korea
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You just said you were deeply suspicious of Iran's desires. Then my question is, why does the United States support a civilian nuclear program for Iran but not for North Korea?
The President. Yes. The Iranians have expressed a desire to have a civilian nuclear program, and we've said that it is the— it makes sense only so long as the plant is under strong international inspection regimes, and the uranium used to run the powerplant is provided by a country with whom we're comfortable—with which we're comfortable, and the spent fuel is collected. In other words, there will be a strong regime—I talked about this at the National Defense University speech, about how we can enhance the spread of nuclear power but in a peaceful way that will assure countries that spent fuel will not be enriched for bomb-making capacities.
Secondly, the Iranians have been, we hope, straightforward in their willingness to accept this kind of international cooperation.
North Korea is in a different situation. The North Koreans have—didn't tell the truth when it came to their enrichment programs. But what's different about it is the South Koreans have offered power. In other words, the South Koreans have said, ""We'll build and share power with you,"" which seems to me to make good sense so long as the North Koreans give up their nuclear weapons, so long as there's full transparency, so long as there's the ability for the international community to know exactly what's going on in a potential weapons program.
The strategy is the same, by the way, in terms of dealing diplomatically with both countries. As I mentioned, the EU-3 is taking the lead. We have a little different strategy, obviously, different players with North Korea, but nevertheless, it's the same concept, a group of nations are negotiating on behalf of the free world to let, in this case, Kim Chong-il understand that we're united in our desire to—for you to give up any ambitions to develop a nuclear weapon and united in our desire, by the way, to prevent you from proliferating.
Bill Roberts [Bloomberg News]. This will be the last question.
National Economy/Interest Rates
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Americans have grown accustomed to historically low interest rates over the last few years. How concerned are you and your economic advisers that as interest rates rise now, that could slow the momentum in the U.S. economy?
The President. I think—first of all, as you know, that the Federal Reserve is completely independent from the White House. They make decisions independent of politics, and that's important. Ben used to serve on the Federal Reserve Board, so he's— he has had some insight into the workings of the Federal Reserve. But our job is to deal with fiscal policy, and the Federal Reserve deals with monetary policy.
And as I've said all along, I trust the judgment of Chairman Alan Greenspan. He is—he makes decisions based upon facts, not based upon politics. And I think it's important for the American people to understand that.
In terms of whether interest rates will— the effect interest rates will have on our economy, I think we're more concerned about energy prices and health care prices. Those are the two areas that we see as having a greater effect on potential economic—on the growth, on the future of economic growth. And that's why the energy bill is an important start, and that's why we've laid out initiatives that we think will help American families deal with the— and small businesses deal with the rising cost of health care.
Listen, thank you all. Great to see you. Mark [Mark Knoller, CBS Radio], good to see you, sir. Thank you."
"March 31, 2006",The President's News Conference With President Vicente Fox Quesada of Mexico and Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada in Cancun,George W. Bush,"George W. Bush, The President's News Conference With President Vicente Fox Quesada of Mexico and Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada in Cancun Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/214805",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-vicente-fox-quesada-mexico-and-prime,"President Fox. Good morning. Welcome for your interest and your presence and attendance. We have come to an end in this productive meeting, as you well know, with bilateral meetings yesterday and today a trilateral meeting, a very productive one, followed by an enlarged meeting, trilateral-wise, with the attendance of the entrepreneurial community, business, and investment of our three countries. Consequently, we will give you full information.
I would like to ask the Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper, to make some comments.
[At this point, Prime Minister Harper spoke in French, which was translated as follows.]
Prime Minister Harper. Thank you. Thank you, President Fox, and ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to thank President Fox first of all. It was a pleasure to meet President Fox and President Bush to discuss issues of importance to our countries and our common will to work together.
In North America, we have an economy that is integrated; it is not necessary to differentiate our products. And we have discussed the progress accomplished in the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America, and we are committed to considering the private sector. First of all, we believe that it is an engine of competitiveness, made up of members of the private sector, that will allow us to make our economies even more competitive.
Our ministers will be working on this. They will be identifying our priorities, and they will make sure that they are followed up. We will be cooperating on issues of importance—on border security, management of urgent situations, as well as energy security. We will prepare a coordinated and exhaustive way to approach the issues of the bird flu, and we will be guided by common principles. Over the course of the next few months, we will be doing everything possible to ensure the security along our borders and to be able to move our merchandise back and forth. We will be working in the area of energy, the area of research and innovation, to be able to deal with clean technologies.
We are happy with the discussions of our trade ministers on cooperation and of the negotiation of our countries, and we encourage them to follow up with this work.
This meeting has been extremely productive. And Presidents Bush and Fox have accepted my invitation for the next summit meeting, which will take place in Canada in 2007.
[Prime Minister Harper continued in English.]
——grateful for our host, President Fox, and to the workers here at the hotel and the Mexican people for their warm hospitality.
Over the past 2 days, I've had the pleasure of meeting with President Fox and President Bush to discuss issues that jointly affect our three nations. I've been encouraged by the common will of our three nations. We are living today in an integrated economy. We cannot afford the politics of isolation.
During my meetings with Presidents Bush and Fox, we reviewed the progress of our Security and Prosperity Partnership, which provides a framework to advance the common interests in areas of security, prosperity, and quality of life.
We committed to further engage the private sector. We've agreed to set up a North American Competitiveness Council, made up of business leaders from all three countries, to advise us on ways to improve the competitiveness of our economies. They will meet with our ministers, identify priorities, and make sure we follow up and implement them.
We agreed to expand our existing cooperation on key issues such as border security, emergency management, and energy security. As an immediate priority, we'll develop a coordinated and comprehensive approach to preparing for a possible avian or pandemic influenza outbreak in North America. Our action will be guided by shared principles. We'll take concrete steps in the coming 24 months to improve the security at our borders and to ensure the smooth and efficient flow of goods and people, particularly—particular discussions with President Bush on the Windsor-Detroit Corridor.
We'll collaborate on energy, especially with respect to innovation and science and technology, with the focus on clean technologies. We also welcome the discussions—the recent discussions by our trade ministers on NAFTA collaboration on trade negotiations with third countries. And we urge that this work be given priority.
These talks were productive. And I'm, of course, very pleased that President Bush and President Fox have accepted my invitation to have the next leaders' meeting in Canada in 2007.
Thank you.
President Fox. President Bush.
President Bush. Thank you for your hospitality. It's a really good choice to pick Cancun—as my press corps will tell you. They're looking forward to staying by the pool after I leave. [Laughter] It's a beautiful, beautiful part of the country.
I want to thank you for your friendship as well. It's been a joy discussing very important issues with you over the course of my Presidency. And this is probably one of the most productive meetings we've had. It's been a pleasure to meet with Prime Minister Harper in his official capacity as the Prime Minister of Canada. I find him to be a very open, straightforward fellow. If he's got a problem, he's willing to express it in a way that's clear for all to understand. And that's the way I like to deal with people.
We've got big goals for this very important relationship. One goal is prosperity. You can't achieve a standard of living increase for your people unless you have a prosperous neighborhood, and it's this prosperity that has been much of a focus on NAFTA. And one of my vows, and I know the other leaders share this goal, is to make sure that people are able to connect the NAFTA relationship with improvement of their own quality of life.
I know there's deep concern about social justice throughout the neighborhood, and social justice can be achieved more likely if people are able to realize their dreams and if there's a prosperous society. And prosperity has been increased as a result of the trade between our nations. And we want to make sure that trade continues in a way that's fair and free but also in a way that enables our countries to be able to compete with the great challenges we face.
And we face prosperity challenges from abroad like never before—the challenge of a growing Chinese economy or the challenge of an Indian economy. And my attitude is we shouldn't fear these challenges; we ought to welcome them and position ourselves so that we can compete. And I think the leaders share that sense of unity when it comes to being a competitive part of the world in the future.
We talked about security. Look, we got long borders, and we got to make sure we work hard to secure the borders. We also have got to make sure we got smart borders. And so the whole vision of our borders has got to be to enhance trade and tourism but to prevent smugglers and terrorists and dope runners from polluting our countries. And I'm confident, with the use of technology and by close collaboration, we'll be able to achieve those objectives.
I want to thank the CEOs and the business leaders from the three countries who are here. I thought we had a very constructive discussion about ways to make sure that there is harmonization between our industries so that the people benefit. And they brought some really good ideas.
We talked about, of course, bird flu, avian flu, and the need to be prepared in case there is an outbreak. We spend a lot of time in my own country preparing for an avian flu outbreak, strategizing as how to coordinate efforts between the Federal, State, and local governments, working to wisely spend money to come up with, hopefully, a vaccine that would then be available for sharing around the world. And I do want to thank Canada for having taken the lead early in this issue and preparing the world for what is possible so that there's good information sharing if the bird flu were to break out in Southeast Asia, for example. But my point is, it's very important for us to share information and data and strategies amongst our three countries so that if this were to happen, there is a focused, coordinated, intelligent response.
We talked about energy. My view of the energy initiative is that we've got to be wise about the resources we have and be smart about the investment for research and development so we can change our energy habits. The truth of the matter is, we'll all be better off if we use alternative sources of energy like ethanol or explore how to use hybrid batteries in a better way. I mean, there's some really interesting things coming down the pike, and I look forward to not only leading my own nation to spend money to be on the leading edge of technological change when it comes to energy but also sharing those technologies and ideas with our counterparts. Because we want to make sure that we've got national security concerns addressed when it comes to energy; we also want to be good stewards of the environment—and we can do both by the use of proper technologies.
It's been a good meeting. I want to thank you for your leadership. I like coming to meetings where people put things on the table and we try to come up with solutions. And this has been such a meeting, Mr. President. Good job. Es todo.
President Fox. Thank you. Thank you so much. Undoubtedly, these two days have brought about spaces for meeting of both friends and partners, and undoubtedly, we have made a very good use of time.
The visit to Chichen-Itza was excellent, as well as yesterday evening's dinner, in a relaxed atmosphere but, likewise, creating this association and making a very productive association. Equally important were the different working meetings.
We took advantage of time; we were not working isolated. We touched upon fundamental items in that meeting. First of all, we carried out an evaluation meeting. Then we got information about the development of programs. And then we gave the necessary instructions for the works that should be carried out in the next period of work.
This is a most important thing, and this association has become a dynamic and professional process, a constructive process, a short-term action process, and great vision and perspective in a long term. Consequently, we have concluded that institutionalizing all these mechanisms is of utmost importance so that they will have continuity, so that there will be a followup— a necessary followup, so that they will be fruitful both at a short, middle, and long term.
So we have established the next meeting. The Prime Minister of Canada has suggested and has invited us to Canada. Next June, we shall have, let's say, an information, evaluation, and results study of the work of this association, this Security and Prosperity Partnership. And we have carried out a series of actions that should be integrated in this report.
First of all, I would like to make clear what has been the results of 12 years of joint work in the free trade agreement, NAFTA. The three nations are fully satisfied of what we have been able to achieve. We have seen the fruits of work through this tool of cooperation, trade, and investment. Nonetheless, we're not fully satisfied. We have to give steps forward. We have many an opportunity and many a challenge.
I want to mention two figures in reference to the results of NAFTA. Mexico has a commercial balance trade of $535 billion, the seventh in size throughout the world. And these would be a direct product of both trade and investment that has been carried out among the three partner countries. And then we should point out that every single State, border States with the United States had per capita income to December as of last year that go beyond to $10,000. The per capita average income has to do with $7,500—the highest in Latin America. Nonetheless, the borderline States are above $10,000 per capita income, and some of them have a per capita rate to $10,000.
We're not talking about small numbers, small figures; we're talking about a concrete result of the efforts and work through trade. It is achieved through investment, and likewise, it is achieved through joint work, everybody's work. Behind all this, there's nothing else but work, work, and work.
Now I would like to mention a couple of items in the goals. First, strengthen and maintain, growing, the free trade agreement, first of all. Benefits are evident, but before the new reality of the 21st century, we have decided to give steps forward and strengthen the relationship. Now we have the alliance both for security and prosperity. One item is as important as the other—shared responsibility an important element—one as important as the other. And that is what the three countries think.
We started with the constitution of the North American Competitiveness Council, so as to consider public and private policies—face a challenge of our region. We want to institutionalize our mechanisms, have a clear project for the next month of June. It would imply mechanisms by means of which we will give the necessary importance and long-term action, something constant, and continuity should be achieved as well. That has been fruitful, and that can give very good results for our region. We are not renegotiating what has been successful or open the free trade agreement. It's going beyond the agreement, both for prosperity and security.
Summarizing, we have to increase competitiveness of our economies, of our companies, our enterprises, our structures, and likewise, our technological and educational levels so as to face competition of other blocs in the world. We have to homogenize normotivity standards so as to have common standards to facilitate jobs and productivity. We have to make borders much more modern with technology so as to guarantee security but the good flow of commodities and products. We have invested a good amount of time to logistics, efficiency and efficacy in customs, topics that have to do with sharing—sharing these efficiencies.
We are totally aware that we require infrastructure studies in the borderline areas so as to analyze needs, to facilitate both trade and passage of people and goods. This is fundamental; security is fundamental for our future development. It is a problem and a challenge shared by the three countries. Migration can only be solved in that we agree upon under the framework of a legislation that will guarantee our legal order, safe and respectful migration, respecting the rights of people.
We have spoken about the collaboration of the three countries to support development and generation of opportunities for Central American countries and the Carib-bean-area countries. We have seen an excellent level of relationships, and these are giving steps forward. They're better and better.
We have more points of coincidence amongst the three countries. I would like to thank the attendance, the presence, in this beautiful port of Cancun in this area of the Riviera Maya. You can see it is dynamic, a beautiful place, as it always has been. We receive millions of tourists every single year, people that come over, and we're proud to receive.
We want to thank President Bush; we want to thank Prime Minister Harper—my acknowledgment, my thanks, and my commitment. We shall be working together, no doubt about it, to give steps forward in the field of prosperity and security. May you have a happy return back home. Thank you.
For the question-and-answer period, we have two questions for the journalists of each country.
Border Security/Trade
Q. Good morning, Presidents and Prime Minister. President Fox, what are the concrete measures that Mexico is implementing to guarantee this indispensable security so as to have a legal, safe, and orderly migration?
For President Bush and President Harper, do you consider that there should be a continuity on the economic policy in Mexico before the change of President in our country? Last but not least, how can the partners of NAFTA—can be competitive before the Asian countries if there are so many differences that are leading us to talk first about security, then productivity? And what are the unilateral decisions on migration matters? Thank you.
President Fox. First, security—many actions have been implemented. Many actions have to do with close cooperation with the security authorities with the United States. This effort, headed by the representative of Homeland Security, Mr. Chertoff, and Minister of the Interior here in Mexico, Mr. Abascal, and the cooperation based upon mutual trust, coresponsibility, and what has to do with security in the borders.
Likewise, we're doing our own work in cases of homicides and crimes among the different Mafias, the drug cartels. We shall continue working on this. There's a presence of Federal forces in the main points in the border, and then a great commitment to win the battle against organized crime and drug trafficking, particularly in the city of Nuevo Laredo. We have programs such as Programma OASISS, OASISS Program, so as to attack the people that are trafficking with people, with migrants. And fortunately, there are more than 120 in jail. And then we have a permanent program, 24 hours a day, so as to achieve this.
We are working in the inner part and in the southern part of the country to stop migration flows that come from Central America that are crossing illegally the southern border of Mexico. And with all due respect to the dignity of these people, respecting their human rights, they are stopped; they remain on temporary bases and stations. They offer them services with dignity, and then we send them back to their communities of origin; 240,000 people—people that were detained, and then they were sent back to Central America.
We are working jointly with the Central American Governments. We have spoken about the fact that the decision of Mexico is not only assuming our responsibilities mi-gration-wise, but we have a firm commitment of generating jobs and employment. We're working jointly with Central America so as to achieve this, so each country will absorb our commitment and our total commitment generating opportunities within our own countries.
And so this program, like the energy initiative for Central America, is one that has the purpose of bringing development and growth to the Central American economies. Thus we're working on a broad spectrum on the issue of security in all of its facets.
President Bush. I don't see how you can be prosperous if you don't have security. I mean, it's—if people are concerned that, for example, the towns along the border aren't secure, it's going to be difficult to keep prosperity alive. And so I appreciate the President's commitment to security along our border, and we've got—we share the same commitment. It's very important to enforce laws. Robust economy depend upon the rule of law, and therefore, when countries enforce law, it kind of creates the conditions for continued economic growth.
When you have robust trade like we have, there are issues that come up. One way to look at it is if we had no trade, there would be no issues. And the more issues there are and the more opportunities there are to discuss them, the likelier it is these economies will continue to grow. And so I don't worry about having to deal with problems. As a matter of fact, I view the problems that have arisen as a result of complex and active trade as positive. And the fundamental question is, can we resolve these issues in a responsible way? And one of the reasons we meet is to put ourselves in a position to do so.
You mentioned something about the elections. I'm not going to talk about them. The only thing I am going to talk about is I love to have a strong, vibrant democracy on our southern border. And I want to thank the President for his strong leadership and his recognition that democracy is a very important legacy of his administration, the previous administration, that we certainly hope there will be a peaceful transition of power, and I'm confident there will be one.
Prime Minister Harper. Obviously, I don't want to get into the issue of Mexican politics, but I can say the same thing that I said yesterday with regard to the leadership of President Fox. We've had both bilateral and multilateral relationships progressively growing and without precedent. I trust that the President is going to leave a stronger economy that is shared, a firm democracy, respect for human rights, and faithfulness to the most important principles for our shared progress, for the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America, and all the good results that come from a free market economy.
All of these things lead to more progress, which we hope the next President will be able to build upon, which will benefit all of our countries.
[Prime Minister Harper continued in English.]
And I'll just repeat that I, obviously, do not intend to make any comments or get myself involved in Mexican politics, but I'll just repeat what I said yesterday, which is that President Fox has provided unprecedented leadership for both our bilateral and our trilateral relations, unprecedented progressive leadership.
I believe that the legacy of that leadership will be to leave behind not just the strong democracy that believes in liberty and human rights but also loyalty and adherence to the principles that are—on which the success of our integrated economy is based. And those are the principles of NAFTA, the principles of our security and economic partnership, and, of course, the advantages of free markets from which all of our nations benefit.
Immigration Reform
Q. Thank you. Mr. President, would you veto an immigration bill that did not include a guest-worker program? And how do you counter the angry argument from conservatives on Capitol Hill who are saying that your demand for one could hurt the Republican Party this fall?
President Bush. The migration issue has been a topic of discussion here, as you can imagine. I told the President exactly what I told our country, that, one, I expect the debate to bring dignity to America, in recognition that America is a land of immigrants and people ought to be treated with respect; and this debate ought to be a debate that does not pit neighbor against neighbor; that focuses on three elements. One is that we are a nation of laws and, therefore, must enforce our laws. And that includes enforcing the laws of people coming into our country illegally.
President Fox and I discussed this issue at length. I don't know if people recognize, but his Government, all aspects of the Mexican Government came together to send a clear message to the American people: The Mexican Government understands it has a responsibility, as well, to protect the border. It is a nation of law. You heard the President talk about not only enforcing the northern border but also the southern border.
I also have said to the American people that we must enforce our laws in the interior of the country. Employers must be held to account if they're employing the people in our country illegally. However, part of the problem is—that complicates the lives of our many employers who are providing employment for people who are here illegally, is that there has been a lot of document forgery. There's an industry that has sprung up, and part of that industry is to provide forged documents so that our employers don't know whether a person is in our country legally or not.
I also believe strongly that an important part of securing the border and enforcing our laws is to recognize there are people in our country doing work that Americans will not do. And those people ought to be given a chance to have a tamper-proof card that enables them to work in our country legally for a period of time. That's called a guest-worker program. One of the important issues about a guest-worker program is, what does that mean for someone's desire to become a citizen of our country? I believe if someone has been here in our country illegally, they should not get at the head of the line if they want to become a citizen. In other words, we have a line of people waiting, people who are in our country legally, waiting to become a citizen. And people who have been in our country illegally should not get ahead of the line who are there legally.
A nation of laws can also be a welcoming nation, and I believe a guest-worker program will help us rid the society and the border of these coyotes who smuggle people in the back of 18-wheelers. I believe it will help get rid of the document forgers. I believe it will help people on both sides of our border respect the laws of our border and enforce our borders. I believe it is important to bring people out of the shadows of American society so they don't have to fear the life they live. I believe it's important for our Nation to uphold human rights and human dignity. And the plan I've just proposed is one that will do all that and achieve important objectives.
And I'm looking forward to working with the Congress. We're making the—I told the President we're making progress. You know, there's a legislative process. It's— some guy, some wag one time put it, it's like watching people make sausage. It's kind of a—you know, probably appears a little unpleasant from your perspective. [Laughter] But we're making progress. And I want a comprehensive bill. And I've made that very clear to the Members of the Congress, and I will continue making it clear to Members of Congress.
Q. [Inaudible]
President Bush. So, no answer—I said I want a comprehensive bill. You're presuming there won't be a comprehensive bill; I believe there will be a comprehensive bill.
Canada-U.S. Relations/Border Security
Q. Mr. President, can you explain to Canadians——
President Bush. Which one?
Q. That would be you, Mr. Bush.
President Bush. Me.
Q. Could you explain to Canadians why they'll need to have a passport or an unspecified secure document before they cross over to the United States? And what would the impact be on both of our countries economically if Canada doesn't follow through by the deadline of the end of next year?
President Bush. I appreciate you bringing up this issue. This is an issue, obviously, that affects not only border crossings with Canada, it also affects border crossings with Mexico. The Congress passed the law, and I intend to enforce the law. But the law said there ought to be a passport or a pass-port-like document that, I believe, if properly implemented, will facilitate travel and facilitate trade, not hinder travel and trade. And the reason I believe that is, I think we can be wise about the use of technologies to—envision a card that can be swiped across a reading device that facilitates the movement of people.
It's a—look, I understand this issue has created consternation. Your Prime Minister made it very clear to me that he's very worried that such a implementation of the law on the books will make it less likely people will want to travel between our countries. I've heard from business leaders who are concerned about the bookings for conventions. And so what I've told the Prime Minister and told President Fox, as well, is that we have an obligation to work very closely with our counterparts to provide a set of standards as to what will meet the obligations of the law.
Again, I repeat to you: I believe this can be done in such a way that it makes future travel, future relations stronger, not weaker.
Prime Minister Harper. Maybe I could just add to that. Obviously, we are concerned. I expressed those concerns to President Bush, and I know they've been expressed by Canadian business leaders as well. The President is confronted with legislation passed by Congress and has a responsibility to act upon that legislation, and we understand that. We understand the security concerns that are behind that.
At the same time, we're obviously concerned that if we don't move quickly and properly on this, that this could have effects on trade and movement of people, conventions, you name it, that is not helpful to our economy or to relationships. So we've agreed that Minister Day and Secretary Chertoff will meet as soon as possible to make this their top priority.
Democracy in Mexico
Q. Mr. President Fox, two questions. The first is, our Senate last night passed a law, and I'd like to know what you're going to do. Will you veto that law, or will you leave the legislative packet to the next President of our country? And second, you have spoken and you have warned us Mexicans against populism and the demagogues who exist in campaigns, in Presidential campaigns, and that we are going through a very difficult stage. I'd like to ask if you already forgot the populist language that you used in your own Presidential campaign when you even talked about—[inaudible]—and things like that? What about talking about democracy using a populist language in the past, but now you are against candidates doing that.
President Fox. In reference to the first item, the Ministry of the Interior will inform, on behalf of the Federal Government, our position. And I celebrate—I'm glad that both the Congress, the lower chamber and the upper chamber, have exercised their autonomy, their freedom. They have discussed and approved one more of the many laws that have been approved in our country in this last 5 years of democratic and respectful Govern-ment—the autonomies and the independence on the other two powers. As never before, we have lived this reality that has been positive, fruitful, in reference to the application of our autonomy and constitutional freedom that all the other powers have.
Now, in reference to the second item, I can only say—and I will say it very clear-ly—from the second of July and since the second of July of the year 2000, there has been absolute freedom, and that is of utmost importance for all of us. Every single person should express according to his own dec","ision and convenience, by all means, respecting the rights of third parties. But above all this, we have the freedom of both Mexicans, ladies and gentlemen, that work in the mass media: press; newspapers; journals; TV. We have now a freedom that we never had in the past. Every single citizen in our country nowadays exercises this freedom openly. This is one of the great fruits and results of democracy won in the second of July of the year 2000.
Iran
Q. President Bush, Secretary of State Rice is finding common ground with the British today on the view that the next step against Iran could be sanctions. Do you agree that's the way to go if Iran fails to comply with the Security Council's 30-day deadline on its nuclear program?
President Bush. Thanks. First, I do want to offer my country's assistance to the people affected by the recent earthquakes in Iran. We obviously have our differences with the Iranian Government, but we do care about the suffering of Iranian people.
There is common agreement that the Iranians should not have a nuclear weapon, the capacity to make a nuclear weapon, or the knowledge as to how to make a nuclear weapon. And the reason there's common agreement is because the Iranian Government with such a weapon, as is now constituted, would pose a serious threat to world security.
Condoleezza Rice is in Europe today to discuss with the P-5, the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council plus Germany, a strategy to go forward in a unified way that says to the Iranian Government, the world rejects your desires to have a nuclear weapon. Condi is strategizing with those who will be making the U.N. Security Council decisions as to that united front. In other words, we agree on a goal. Now the question is, how do we work together to achieve that goal? And you're watching Secretary of State Rice work with our friends to remind the Iranians on a regular and consistent basis that if they want to be—participate in the international order of things, if they don't want to isolate themselves, they must listen very carefully to what we are saying with unified voice.
Murder Investigation in Cancun
Q. My question is to President Fox, and I wonder if we could prevail upon you, sir, to answer it in English. A few weeks ago, there was a very bloody murder here with the Ianiero family in Cancun. Two young Canadian mothers are very concerned, back in Canada, that Mexican authorities have mistakenly made them suspects amidst concerns, also in Canada, the Mexicans may have bungled this investigation. Can you tell us where this investigation is going, and can you assure those two young women, indeed, they are not suspects?
President Fox. Well, we are absolutely sorry, and we have our, well, feelings that a crime has been carried out here in a hotel in Cancun. The attorneyship office is working, both the Federal one and the local one—they're working on the investigation. When the data is ready and when they finally decide, we can claim which are the guilty people. As of now, that is the only information we have at hand. We're working closely. We are reporting to the Government and the authorities of Canada. Investigation is being carried out. So far we cannot make any further comments. Thank you.
Prime Minister Harper. ——say that we do appreciate the full cooperation of the Mexican Government, Mexican police at all levels. There has been consultation with our officials, and I've spoken to the RCMP, and they assure me that that has been the case, particularly since the commitments made by Secretary Derbez in Ottawa. So we are working together in this; we're fully apprised of the situation. I can just add one small thing, which is that we're told once again, and I think we've been saying this repeatedly for some time, there is no extradition pending—extradition demand pending, nor is there one anticipated in the near future. And that's probably about all I can say.
President Fox. Muchas gracias."
"May 16, 2006",The President's News Conference With Prime Minister John Howard of Australia,George W. Bush,"George W. Bush, The President's News Conference With Prime Minister John Howard of Australia Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/215684",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-john-howard-australia,"President Bush. Thank you all. It's my honor to welcome the Prime Minister of Australia here to the East Room for a press briefing. I'm going to feed him tonight—before I feed him tonight, I'm going to feed him to you. [Laughter]
We just had a really interesting discussion about a lot of issues. First, I admireJohn Howard's understanding that the war on terror still goes on and that we've got to be steadfast and firm if we intend to succeed in defeating the terrorists.
Secondly, I appreciate very much his understanding and discussions about the way forward in Iraq. We spent quite a bit of time talking about the new Government. I described to him as best as I could my feelings about the Prime Minister-designee, who I believe is a firm and decisive person that is going to make a difference in that country's future.
I thanked him very much for the commitment of Australian troops. We, of course, talked about the Iraqi security forces' capacity to defend themselves. I reported to him that we're pleased with the progress being made but that the United States will make decisions about our troop levels based upon conditions on the ground.
We talked about Afghanistan. Again, I want to thank the Prime Minister for his support there for this fledgling democracy. We talked about North Korea. We talked about Iran. We talked about a lot. And that's what you'd expect when you're talking to an ally and a friend and a good strategic thinker.
The Prime Minister is capable of not only seeing the problems for today; he's capable of looking down the road. And I appreciate his advice and his judgment on national security matters, as well as in talking about issues like energy and trade. We've got a good relationship with Australia, and we intend to keep it that way.
I always remind my friends who talk to me about countries around the world, I say, I can't think of a country more like— a place more like Texas than Australia. And that's a compliment—[laughter]—except for some of these people over here. [Laughter] The people of Australia are independent-minded; they're smart; they're capable; they're hard-working. And I really enjoy my relationship with the Prime Minister.
So Mr. Prime Minister, welcome. Thanks for coming, and the floor is yours.
Prime Minister Howard. Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. Again, can I thank you very warmly for the great hospitality that you have extended to me. It was a real privilege to sit around the Cabinet table and talk to your Cabinet officers, which followed a very extensive discussion between the two of us about all of those issues of which you spoke.
We remain a steadfast ally of the United States in the war against terror. I've made that clear on every occasion I've spoken here in the United States. The war against terror will go on for a long time; I think we have to accept that. Progress is being made. The challenge remains very, very strong, and there needs to be a continued commitment. And we admire and respect the leadership given by you and by the United States in that war, and it's a war that confronts us all. Those who imagine that somehow or other you can escape it by rolling yourself into a little ball and going over in the corner and hoping that you're not going to be noticed are doomed to be very, very uncomfortably disappointed.
We did have an opportunity to talk extensively about some of the challenges in our immediate region. And I spoke about the situation in East Timor and the Solomon Islands and the importance of the role of Indonesia, the symbolism and also the practical consequence of Indonesia being the largest Islamic country in the world. And therefore, the success and prosperity of moderate Islamic leadership in that country is itself a very important factor in the long-term success of the fight against terrorism, because the fight against terrorism is not only a military and physical one; it is also an intellectual one. And it's a question of providing within the Islamic world a successful democratic model as an alternative to the fanaticism of those who would obscenely invoke the sanction of Islam to justify what they seek to do.
Can I finally say that of the many ties that bind Australia and the United States, as I said on the lawn earlier today, none are more important, of course, than the shared values and the beliefs that both of our countries have—that the spread of democracy around the world is an important goal and an important responsibility. It's been a privilege for our two peoples to enjoy democracy in an uninterrupted fashion for so long that we tend to take it for granted, and we forget its liberating impact on those who taste and experience it for the first time. And both of our societies have a responsibility in expanding the opportunities for democracy, and that, of course, lies very much at the heart of much of what our two societies do.
Mr. President, thank you very, very much for the honor you've done me and the courtesy and friendship that you've extended to me and all of the traveling party. We appreciate it very, very deeply, indeed. Thank you.
President Bush. Two questions a side. Terry [Terence Hunt, Associated Press].
Terrorist Surveillance Program
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, you've said that the Government is not trolling through the lives of innocent Americans, but why shouldn't ordinary people feel that their privacy is invaded by the NSA compiling a list of their telephone calls?
President Bush. What I have told the American people is, we'll protect them against an Al Qaida attack, and we'll do so within the law. I've been very clear about the principles and guidelines of any program that has been designed to protect the American people.
I've also been clear about the fact that we do not listen to domestic phone calls without court approval and that this Government will continue to guard the privacy of the American people. But if Al Qaida is calling into the United States, we want to know, and we want to know why.
For the Australian press friends here, we got accused of not connecting dots prior to September the 11th, and we're going to connect dots to protect the American people, within the law. The program he's asking about is one that has been fully briefed to Members of the United States Congress in both political parties. They are very aware of what is taking place. The American people expect their Government to protect them, within the laws of this country, and I'm going to continue to do just that.
Prime Minister Howard. Australian press. Mr. Curry.
Australian Prime Minister Howard
Q. Mr. President, your relationship with Mr. Howard is obviously very close, personally. And I was wondering, first, could you just expand a little on that chemistry? And secondly, sir, do you think you would be able to work effectively with a future Australian leader, be it either a successor of Mr. Howard from his own party or from their opposition?
President Bush. Well, I suspect he's going to outlast me, so that is a moot point—[laughter]—probably a question you ought to ask him. Somebody said, ""You and John Howard appear to be so close. Don't you have any differences?"" And I said, ""Yes, he doesn't have any hair."" [Laughter]
Look, ours is a world in which sometimes people tell you something and they don't mean it. In order to work together to make difficult decisions—decisions of war and peace, decisions of security, decisions of trade—you've got to have somebody you talk to that tells you straight up what's on their mind. You know, politics sometimes produces people that will tell you one thing and don't mean it. It's really hard to be making rational decisions if somebody you're talking to just doesn't level with you.
And that's what I like about John Howard. He may not be the prettiest person on the block—[laughter]—but when he tells you something, you can take it to the bank. He is a reliable partner. And we don't agree on 100 percent, of course. But the interesting thing, talking to John Howard, is that you can trust the man. And that's what is a necessary ingredient to be working together for the common good.
And I also appreciate a person who is capable of standing by a decision. I remember the campaign—as a matter of fact, your campaign was right before my campaign— and John Howard stood strong. And I remember telling somebody—and the polls didn't look all that good, I guess, at one point in time—and I remember saying to somebody, ""This man is going to be rewarded at the ballot box because the people of Australia want somebody who is consistently strong, not somebody who tries to waffle around trying to figure out where to end up for political expediency.""
People may not agree with his position on every issue, but people have got to agree with the fact that he's a man of conviction. And that's the essence of leader-ship—courage and conviction. And so we've got a relationship that is based upon respect, and I respect him. I've seen him in action. I've seen what it means to have him being pressured—probably by your newspaper. But I've seen him stand strong, and that's what's needed in this world.
Holland [Steve Holland, Reuters], yes.
Immigration Reform
Q. Thank you, sir. On immigration, some worry that the U.S. military is stretched too thin. How effective can these National Guard troops be if they're shuttling in and out of the border area every two or three weeks? And how are you going to turn around these House Members who seem to be unswayed by your argument on the guest-worker program?
President Bush. The program to put Guard on the border is one that will enable the Border Patrol to do its job better. It's very important for the American people to know it's the Border Patrol that's going to be on the frontline of apprehending people trying to sneak into our country. And the Guard will be doing a variety of functions, which I outlined last night.
Secondly, the Guard is—the up to 6,000 Guard in the first year of operation really is not going to put a strain on our capacity to fight and win the war on terror, as well as deal with natural disasters. And, of course, we'll be working in conjunction with Governors to make sure that that's not the case, that it doesn't put an unnecessary strain on other functions of the Guard.
Thirdly, the Pentagon is briefing today— how the program is going to work. There are Guard troops in Arizona and New Mexico and Texas that can be used by the Governors down there to work with the Border Patrol, that they'll be reimbursed for. And there's also training missions that can be used to help complement the Border Patrol. We're going to have double the Border Patrol agents since 2001, by 2008. And what the Guard is doing, the Guard is providing an interim service until those Border Patrol agents get stood up.
I made it clear to the country last night that we're not going to militarize our border. Mexico is a friend. But what we are going to do is use assets necessary to make sure that we can assure the American people that the border is secure.
Now in order to secure the border, it's important for people up here in Washington to understand that there's got to be a temporary-worker program. Border security and a temporary-worker program are really important because—let me say, a temporary-worker program is really important to border security, because we don't want people trying to sneak into the country. It seems rational to me to say, ""If you're coming to work, come to work in a legal way, on a temporary basis, so you're not trying to sneak across."" So the tem-porary-worker program goes hand in hand with border security. In order for there to be a—in order for us to solve the problem of an immigration system that's not working, it's really important for Congress to understand that there needs a—that the elements I described all go hand in hand.
And so I'll continue to work with them. Look, this is a hard issue for many people.
Q. Would you go along with border protection only and a guest-worker program— [inaudible].
President Bush. I said I want a comprehensive bill because I understand there needs to be a comprehensive bill in order to make—in order for us to achieve the objective.
And the objective is, on the one hand, protect our borders, and on the other hand, never lose sight of the thing that makes America unique, which is, we're a land of immigrants and that we—we're not going to discriminate against people. Now, we don't think there ought to be an automatic path to citizenship; that's called amnesty. Amnesty would be wrong. Amnesty would say that somebody that stood in line legally is—is mistreated, as far as I'm concerned. Amnesty would mean that more people would try to come and sneak into our country in the hopes that they would be granted automatic citizenship.
But there ought to be a way for somebody to pay a fine or learn English or prove that they've been here for a long time working and be able to get in line—not the head of the line but the back of the line—in order to become a citizen.
You know, there are some in our country who say, ""Let's just deport everybody."" It's unrealistic. It may sound attractive to some. You can't deport people who have been in this country for a long period of time— millions of people that have been here.
And so we've got to be rational about how we move forward. And part of my appeal last night was to say to people, let's don't get so emotional that we forget who we are. We're a land of immigrants, and when we welcome somebody to our country who is here legally, willing to work and willing to realize a dream, it helps restore our soul.
So this is a difficult debate for Members. I'm going to continue working with them. Part of my job is to lead, and I did last night. I said, here's how we get to where we need to be.
Australia's Wheat Market/Trade
Q. Mr. President, American wheat growers are angry that hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes were paid to Saddam's Iraq to protect Australia's wheat market. Do you share their anger, and do you sympathize with the push on Capitol Hill to investigate this further in America? And Mr. Prime Minister, I'd be interested in your comments on a possible Capitol Hill inquiry into this.
President Bush. My own judgment is, is that the Howard administration is pretty capable of investigating what took place, and I look forward to seeing the results of the investigation.
Prime Minister Howard. For my part, you are aware of what the Australian Government has done. Australia is the only country in the world that has responded to the bulk of findings with a public inquiry with the powers of a royal commission. And you are aware that the commission has probably completed its public hearings, and we're likely to have a report by the 30th of June.
What the United States Congress does in relation to this is a matter for the United States Congress. And, clearly, if it decides to do something, then we will respond in the appropriate fashion. But for our part, in Australia, we have been open, transparent that we do not approve in any way, shape, or form of the payment of bribes, and if a finding is to that effect, then the full processes of Australian law should be brought to bear. You can't be more transparent than that, and I think that is understood in the United States.
But obviously, just as we have responsibilities within Australia, the legislators of this country, where I'm a guest, have responsibilities in this country. And if it discharges those in a particular fashion, the way it thinks fit—well, that's its right, and we will respond in what is also the appropriate fashion. I don't think I can add anything more to that, and we have been patently transparent and open. And let me just repeat again, Australia is the only country in the world that has established a public inquiry with the powers of the royal commission.
President Bush. Thank you, sir."
"July 06, 2006",The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada,George W. Bush,"George W. Bush, The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/216621",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-stephen-harper-canada,"President Bush. Thank you all. Welcome. It's been my honor to visit with Stephen Harper, the Prime Minister of Canada, in the Oval Office. After this exercise in democracy, I'll be buying him lunch, where we'll continue our discussions. I'm impressed by his leadership style. I appreciate the fact that he doesn't mince words. He tells me what's on his mind, and he does so in a real, clear fashion.
We talked about a lot of subjects. We talked about Iran and our joint desire to convince the Iranian regime to give up its nuclear weapons ambitions. We talked about North Korea, and I shared with him our strategy to work with five other—four other nations to convince the North Koreans to adhere to agreements they had already reached with the world.
We talked about the war on terror, and I told the Prime Minister how pleased Americans were that the Canadian Government did the hard work necessary to disrupt terrorist plots. It just goes to show how safe Canada is. When you've got a government that's active and a police force that's capable, people ought to be rest assured that Canada is on top of any plots.
I thanked the Prime Minister and the Canadian people for their involvement in Afghanistan. This is a serious foreign policy decision by the Government, and it's a necessary decision, in my judgment, to help make this world a more peaceful place. It just goes to show the important role Canada can play in foreign policy. Canada has got a set of values that are extremely important for the world to see.
And I do want to thank the families of those soldiers who are in Afghanistan for supporting their loved ones. Their soldiers are doing fantastic work. I asked prior to your visit here from our military folks how they were doing; they said, great. And they're making the country proud.
I appreciate very much our discussion about Darfur. I believe that Canada and the United States can make a difference in Darfur and should. As you know, our Nation declared the situation in Darfur a genocide. We will work with the international community to bolster the AU forces that are there now. I believe they ought to be blue-helmeted, and I believe there ought to be NATO involvement with a blue-helmeted, AU-augmented force on the ground. The message has got to be clear to the Government of Sudan: We're not going to tolerate this kind of activity.
I speak frequently with my Secretary of State on this issue, Mr. Prime Minister, to make sure that we expedite the arrival of augmented troops to save lives. I talked to Kofi Annan the other night, by the way, about this very subject. And so I appreciate your understanding, and I really appreciate your working on this.
You know, we cooperate closely in our neighborhood. We just renewed the NORAD accord, and I want to thank you for that. I remember going out—one of the hurricanes was about to hit us here, and I can remember talking to and having dinner with a Canadian general there, and it was a—it just reminded me of how close that our relations need to be.
We talked about trade. We have a lot of trade with Canada. It's in this Nation's interest to trade with Canada. It's in, I think, the Canadian interest to trade with the United States. I'll let the Prime Minister speak to that. But it's important when you have trade to have goods and services and people flow as smoothly as possible between our two countries.
We've had some disputes in the past, trade disputes. That's what you expect when you have a lot of trade. And probably the most nettlesome trade dispute was softwood lumber. And I appreciate the Prime Minister's leadership in helping us resolve this issue. It's a tough issue. It was a tough issue for the Canadian Government; it's a tough issue for us. Nevertheless, the fact that we were able to reach an accord just goes to show how trading partners can be active in trade and be will-ing—and solve problems. I think this is a really important solution, and I want to thank you for that.
Needless to say, the Prime Minister expressed deep concerns about the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative. The last time I was with him, he expressed concerns. He basically was a little impatient, if I might clarify your—it seemed like you were impatient, at least—[laughter]—and straightforward. ""Look,"" he said, ""I understand there's a law on the books. Show us what's going to happen."" And I understand the concerns. If you have a relationship like we have, where there's a lot of activity and a lot of people moving across the border, it makes sense for the Prime Minister of Canada to say, ""Look, we just want to know what the rules are to determine whether or not it is compatible with our relationship.""
And so I assured him that my view is— simple and easy to understand is the operative words. And we will continue our discussions about this initiative, particularly since the Secretary of Homeland Security, Chertoff—who is sitting right over there, by the way—will be joining us for lunch. Unless you don't want me to invite him. [Laughter]
We talked about—well, we talked about a lot of subjects, and that's what you'd expect friends to do.
Mr. Prime Minister, the floor is yours. I'm proud you're here, and thanks for coming.
Prime Minister Harper. Well, thank you very much, Mr. President, for the invitation and for the kind words. And thank you for doing something I never thought I'd see, which is have the Canadian media stand when I entered the room. But we certainly enjoy that.
[At this point, Prime Minister Harper spoke in French, and no translation was provided. He then continued in English, as follows.]
Prime Minister Harper. ——your hospitality. The United States and Canada have a strong relationship, strong and firm relationship based on the largest commerce and social interaction in the history of any two countries of the world, and we were able to discuss a wide range of bilateral and international matters where we, more often than not, share common values and common objectives.
We discussed many topics of interest to our respective countries and citizens, in particular, as the President mentioned, the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative. The President and I agreed that the implementation of the provisions of the WHTI must not unduly hinder cross-border travel or tourism or trade. And to that end, we've tasked our officials to agree on common standards for securing alternate documents and, preferably, as soon as possible.
We discussed the critical role Canada, in particular our oil sands, can play in providing energy security. The President and I have agreed to task our officials to provide a more forward-looking approach focused on the environment, climate change, air quality, and energy issues in which our Governments can cooperate. We raised the issue of how regulatory cooperation could increase productivity, while helping to protect our health, safety, and environment.
We also expressed, as the President just did, our mutual satisfaction on the significant progress made on the longstanding softwood lumber dispute. Both countries have now initialed the legal text. That legal text faithfully reproduces and documents the agreements reached between our Governments and various premiers on April the 27th, and I now urge all relevant parties to move forward with its implementation.
The President and I also discussed a number of important international issues, in particular our role in Afghanistan. We have 2,300 men and women on the ground as part of the Canadian forces. They're playing an important role in security and development in order to protect our national interest, rebuild Afghanistan, and ensure it never becomes again a safe haven for terrorists.
We also discussed recent developments in Iran, and we expressed our mutual concern about North Korea's latest provocative acts. We also discussed the upcoming G- 8 meeting in Russia, where issues like energy security, infectious diseases, education, and innovation will be on the agenda. And finally, we did touch briefly on the recent Mexican election. Canada has full confidence in Mexico's institutions and processes, and I look forward very much to working with the next President of Mexico.
President Bush. Thank you, sir.
Keil [Richard Keil, Bloomberg News].
North Korea
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Do you want the United Nations to impose sanctions on North Korea? And how will you go about persuading the Russians and the Chinese to back those moves if you make them? And in addition to that, sir, what kind of threat do you think North Korea poses to world peace right now?
President Bush. Nontransparent societies run by Governments that aren't selected by the people are—very difficult to tell what's going on. That's part of the problem. We're dealing with a person who was asked not to fire a rocket by the Chinese, the South Koreans, the United States, the Japanese, and the Russians. And he fired seven of them, which then caused the Secretary of State and myself to get on the phone with our partners and reminded them that—of the importance of speaking with one voice.
It's to—saying to Kim Jong Il, there is a better way forward for you than isolating yourself from the rest of the world; that there is a opportunity for you to stick to some of your agreements, and that is to verifiably disarm; and that there will be a better life than being isolated and, most importantly, a better life for your people than isolation will bring.
And so I was on the phone this morning with Hu Jintao and President Putin, and last night I talked to Prime Minister Koizumi and President Roh. And my message was that we want to solve this problem diplomatically, and the best way to solve the problem diplomatically is for all of us to be working in concert and to send one message, and that is—to Kim Jong Il—that we expect you to adhere to international norms, and we expect you to keep your word.
One way to send a message is through the United Nations. And the Japanese laid down a resolution which we support. But we're working with our partners to make sure we speak with one voice. Diplomacy takes a while, particularly when you're dealing with a variety of partners. And so we're spending time diplomatically making sure that voice is unified.
I was pleased from the responses I got from the leaders. They, like me, were— are concerned, concerned about a person who doesn't seem to really care about what others say. And so we're working it, working it hard. And it's—and by the way, an effective policy is one which is not just the United States trying to solve problems. So I spent time talking to the Canadian Prime Minister about it. I mean, Canada is a, should be, and must be an active participant in helping deal with problems.
He brought up Haiti, for example, in the Oval Office. Canada has made a significant contribution to stability in Haiti in the past. And it's an important—my only point is, is that we will continue to work with others to deal with problems that crop up.
Q. How much of a threat to the world——
President Bush. Well, you know, Dick, I think that—let's put it this way—he's going to pose less of a threat the more isolated he becomes and the more we work together. And as I mentioned to you, it's hard to tell. This is a society in which there's very little freedom, including freedom of the press. There's not a lot of light shining in there.
And so we take his statements very seriously. He's kind of declared himself to be a nuclear power. We obviously watch very carefully his testings. We're trying to make sure, by the way, that the missile that he fired wasn't headed for Canada. We don't know for a fact where it was headed. But, for example, one thing that Stephen and I talked about is he could be seemingly firing a missile at the United States, say, at—I don't know, this is all speculation— but could be headed toward the Northwest of our country. And it wouldn't take much for it to get off course and end somewhere where he may not have intended.
My only point is, is that we will work very closely on these matters together. It's in our interests that we send a clear message to the leader of North Korea.
Canada-U.S. Border
Q. Christian St. Pierre, Radio Canada. Happy birthday, sir.
President Bush. It's amazing, the first birthday greeting I got from the press came from the Canadian press. [Laughter] Thank you. I am grateful. You're not 60 years old, are you? [Laughter] Well, let me just say this—it's a lot younger than you think.
Q. President Bush—
President Bush. Sure.
Q. My question is about the security at the border. On the passport issue, you seem very open, but there is a deadline of 2008.
President Bush. Yes.
Q. Is there any chance of getting a— of dealing? And Mr. Harper, can you comment in French and English, please?
President Bush. Thank you. We are responding to congressional law. And I—let me reinterpret your—is your question, is there flexibility in the law, basically? Yes, I think that if Congress decides there needs to be flexibility, there will flexibility. Interestingly enough, the Senate passed—made its intention clear to extend deadlines. That hasn't happened in the House yet. And so we are operating in the executive branch under the idea that nothing will change, and therefore, we need to get to the Canadian Government as quickly as possible our definition of what a reasonable policy is. If Congress decides to be flexible, we obviously will be flexible.
But the reason we're dealing with this issue is because the legislative branch put this into law, put the need to have these kind of documents into law. And as I told Chertoff, who is responsible for implementing the law, that I would like this— to the extent the law allows, for there to be a lot of flexibility and simplicity.
As the Governor of Texas, I'm used to a border situation where hundreds of thousands of people crossed every day. See, we—on our southern border, there are a lot of Mexican citizens who come into the United States and work on a daily basis and then go back home. It happens a lot. And therefore, I fully understand the need for there to be simplicity in the documentation. It needs to be easy for somebody who is known and a person that is—makes a living on the other side of the border. There's—a lot of kids go to college in, like, El Paso, Texas, and they're living in Mexico, so they've got to go back and forth on a regular basis. So I'm familiar with this issue a lot, and I really do emphasize the need for us to be mindful of what a onerous program could mean to good relations as well as facilitation of trade.
I can remember Stephen's concerns about the effect of this initiative might have on conventions, for example, in Canada. He brought up today an interesting example of Little League teams playing baseball in Manitoba. And so, in other words, there's a lot of just daily commerce that we've got to be mindful about, not just trade, but the movement of people. And we are, we are.
And so to answer your question, if the Congress provides flexibility, of course we will work with the Canadian Government to extend deadlines. If the Congress says, ""No, this is what our intent is,"" we will work with the Canadian Government to make the law work.
[Prime Minister Harper spoke in French, and no translation was provided.]
Prime Minister Harper. We're on two tracks here. We've indicated we want to cooperate. We understand this is a congressional law the administration has to put into place. We're prepared to cooperate to make it work as smoothly and effectively as possible. We need more information, and we've been pressing for that for some time, and we'll continue to do so.
At the same time, our other track is obviously to encourage some reexamination of the law. The Senate has recently passed an amendment that would delay this process by a year and a half. We have some indications from some quarters of the House of Representatives, some will there to consider the same thing.
As I say, we—and I just want to emphasize—we in Canada share the United States security concerns and objectives. I think, as you all know, recently with events in Toronto, it's been brought home to all of us that we face exactly the same kind of security threats and are defending exactly the same kinds of values. And I would hate to see a law go into place that has the effect of not just limiting and endangering trade or tourism but endangering all those thousands of social interactions that occur across our border every day and are the reason why Canada and the United States have the strongest relationship of any two countries, not just on the planet but in the history of mankind.
And I would just urge the Congress to think carefully, that if the fight for security ends up meaning that the United States becomes more closed to its friends, then the terrorists have won. And I don't think either of us want that. So we're prepared to cooperate, and also urge the Congress to apply some flexibility in reaching their objectives of security.
President Bush. Thank you.
Jim Axelrod [CBS News].
North Korea/Foreign Policy
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Kim Jong Il has been described as quirky, as odd. A member of your administration yesterday compared him to an unloved child looking for attention. And I'm wondering if you agree with that assessment. Does he pose——
President Bush. Who was that person? [Laughter]
Q. Does he pose—come to the booth, sir, I'll tell you who it was. [Laughter] Does he pose any particular unique problems to deal with? And do you feel that he's looking, for instance, at what's been offered to the Iranians by the world community in terms of incentives and saying, ""I'd like a little of that for myself""?
President Bush. It's hard for me to tell you what's on his mind. He lives in a very closed society. It's unlike our societies where we have press conferences and people are entitled to ask questions, and there's all kinds of discussions out of administrations and people saying this, saying that, and the other. This is a very closed society.
We do know there's a lot of concentration camps. We do know that people are starving. As a matter of fact, our Nation has tried to help feed the hungry. But what we don't know is his intentions, and so I think we've got to plan for the worst and hope for the best. And planning for the worst means to make sure that we continue to work with friends and allies, as well as those who've agreed to be a part of the six-party talks, to continue to send a unified message.
We've also got a very strong Proliferation Security Initiative, because one of the threats that can emanate from a closed society, particularly one that claims to have nuclear weapons, is proliferation. One of the real dangers we face is weapons of mass destruction in the hands of people who would like to continue to hurt us, hurt the United States or hurt Canada, hurt anybody who has the courage to stand up and embrace freedom, see. That's the big threat.
And so we don't know, Jim, about his intentions, but we take—we're planning. And so one of the things we've done— and I thank Canada's contribution—is for there to be a very strong initiative to prevent proliferation, through what we call the Proliferation Security Initiative. And it's an important initiative. It's a way to say, we're not going to allow you to threaten us; we're not going to allow you to—the rocket— as I say, I'm not exactly sure what the azimuth was of the rocket. We've got our people still analyzing that. But, for example, we didn't—we don't know what was on the rocket. We don't know where the rocket was headed. It would have been helpful, of course, had he said, ""Here's what we're going to do. Here's our intentions. Here's what—we want to work with you; we want to explain it."" Who knows—maybe send a satellite—who knows what his intention was.
But that's not the way he decided to deal with it. He just decided to say—to start firing, and he fired seven of them. And we take this seriously. We take, and we all should take, threats seriously. That's one of the lessons of September the 11th, is that what takes place in other parts of the world can come home to hurt the American people. See, a failed government in Afghanistan enabled plotters and planners to train and then come and kill 3,000 of our citizens. And so it used to be that's it's okay if something were happening from afar, oceans could protect us. I presume that's how some in Canada used to feel. The lesson of September the 11th is, is that we're vulnerable, and therefore, we've got to deal with each threat.
I've assured the American people and assured our friends and allies, we want to deal with threats diplomatically. The best way to deal with threats diplomatically is to encourage others to be a part of the process. And that's what we're doing. That's why we've got the six-party talks.
And one of the keys in the six-party talks is for all the nations to send clear messages to Kim Jong Il. That's why I was on the phone this morning, saying as clearly as I could to our fellow partners, four other leaders, to say, let's send a common message that you won't be rewarded for ignoring the world and that you'll be isolated if you continue to do this, and yet there's a way forward.
See, I care deeply about the people in North Korea. I truly do. It breaks my heart to know that young children are literally starving to death. And I wish—I just wish at some point in time there was an openness in that society where we could help save lives. I'm also realistic enough to realize what weapons of mass destruction could mean in the world in which we live.
And so we're working this issue hard. We're working the Iranian issue hard. Steve and I talked about a strategy going into the G-8 session. I talked to President Putin this morning abut making sure that not only do we send messages to the North Koreans but that our strategy will work with Iran.
And it's just really important for the American President to see the world the way it is, not the way we would hope it would be, and to deal with threats, and to do so in a way that will achieve results. And it takes a while. I mean, these threats didn't arise overnight, and these problems won't be solved overnight. But we've got strategies in place to deal with them.
And one of the reasons why it's important to have Steve here is so we can talk about how we can work together to deal with it. And they're not just threats to our security that normal people think of. HIV/AIDS on the continent of Africa is a threat to our security in the long run. That's why I'm proud to report the United States took the lead on setting up the Global Fund, as well as bilateral programs to help save people's lives. I think it's in our interests. I also happen to believe in the admonition, ""To whom much is given, much is required.""
And so we've got a robust foreign policy on a lot of fronts, and I intend to keep it that way. And I'm confident that what we're doing is going to make this world a better place. And I'm proud to have allies like Steve who understand the stakes of the 21st century.
Birthday Present for the President
Q. Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, before I ask you a question, I'm just curious what you think of that belt buckle the Prime Minister gave you as a birthday gift, and are you wearing it?
President Bush. I hadn't seen it yet. [Laughter] Oh, Lee, you gave it away. [Laughter]
North Korea/Missile Defense System
Q. Mr. President, on a serious note, in light of the North Korean missile test and the fact that North Korea could launch another series of missiles at any minute, did you ask Canada to reconsider joining in the Ballistic Missile Defense Shield?
And, Prime Minister, do you still think it's wrong and not in Canada's interest to join the BMD? And if—when you're responding, could you do it in French and English, please?
President Bush. Anyway, thanks for the belt buckle in advance. [Laughter]
Prime Minister Harper. No problem at all.
President Bush. Looking forward to getting it.
Prime Minister Harper. Figure if you're going to be 60, you should get something.
President Bush. That's right. Just hope the belt fits. [Laughter]
No, I didn't bring it up, because I figured if he was interested, he would tell me. I did explain to him, however, that we will continue to build a robust system, because I think it's in—I know it's in our interest to make sure that we're never in a position where somebody can blackmail us.
So we'll continue to invest and spend. And since this issue first came up, we've made a lot of progress on how to—towards having an effective system. And it's in our interest that we continue to work along these lines.
But, no, my attitude was—this is a—this was a particularly difficult political issue inside Canada, and my relationship is such that if Stephen thought it was of importance, he would have told me what's on his mind. Now, maybe he's going to bring it up over lunch, but he didn't bring it up earlier.
Prime Minister Harper. Let me just begin by saying——
President Bush. Interesting question, though.
Prime Minister Harper. Let me just begin by saying that—first of all, the question was asked earlier, I think, is North Korea a threat. I don't think the issue is whether North Korea is a threat. North Korea clearly wants to be a threat. And I think—I just want to repeat what the President has said. Given that that's a society of the kind of nature it is, I think this should concern us immensely, and the fact that it is prepared to arm itself and prepared to threaten to use such armaments—I think it is something that we should be gravely concerned about, as was said earlier.
Missiles that are fired in the direction of the United States constitute a threat to Canada. That's one of the reasons why our Government renewed, on a permanent basis, the NORAD treaty. Through NORAD we have a special relationship on air defense and we share information on these kind of matters. I think as you know, to answer your specific question, the Government of Canada is not prepared to open a missile defense issue at this time, but I will say that I think it should be obvious, when we look at this kind of threat, why the United States and others would want to have a modern and flexible defense system against this kind of threat. So I think that's something, at least, our Government fully understands.
[Prime Minister Harper spoke in French, and no translation was provided.]
President Bush. Welcome. Thank you for your birthday greetings.
President's Birthday
Q. Mr. President, happy birthday.
President Bush. Thank you very much. Yes.
Q. It's also my birthday.
President Bush. Today's your birthday, too?
Q. Yes, sir.
President Bush. It is? Come on up. Let's have a birthday picture. Come up, come up, come up. [Laughter] Come on. Get up here. Anybody else have their birthday today? [Laughter] It's your birthday? Yes, sure. It is your birthday? Come on. [Laughter] It's amazing how everybody's birthday is today.
[All present sang Happy Birthday to the President and others celebrating birthdays.]
President Bush. Dear Richard—he just told me he's 30 years old. [Laughter] Happy birthday. Happy birthday."
"September 15, 2006",The President's News Conference,George W. Bush,"George W. Bush, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/268757",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-4,"The President. It's always a pleasure to be introduced into the Rose Garden. Thank you, Wendell [Wendell Goler, FOX News Channel]. Thank you for coming. I'm looking forward to answering some of your questions.
This week, our Nation paused to mark the fifth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. It was a tough day for a lot of our citizens. I was so honored to meet with family members and first-responders, workers at the Pentagon, all who still had heaviness in their heart. But they asked me a question— you know, they kept asking me, ""What do you think the level of determination for this country is in order to protect ourselves?"" That's what they want to know.
You know, for me, it was a reminder about how I felt right after 9/11. I felt a sense of determination and conviction about doing everything that is necessary to protect the people. I'm going to go back to New York to address the United Nations General Assembly. I'm going to talk to world leaders gathered there about our obligation to defend civilization and liberty, to support the forces of freedom and moderation throughout the Middle East. As we work with the international community to defeat the terrorists and extremists, to provide an alternative to their hateful ideology, we must also provide our military and intelligence professionals with the tools they need to protect our country from another attack. And the reason they need those tools is because the enemy wants to attack us again.
Right here in the Oval Office, I get briefed nearly every morning about the nature of this world, and I get briefed about the desire of an enemy to hurt America. And it's a sobering experience, as I'm sure you can imagine. I wish that weren't the case, you know. But it is the case. And therefore, I believe it is vital that our folks on the frontline have the tools necessary to protect the American people.
There are two vital pieces of legislation in Congress now that I think are necessary to help us win the war on terror. We will work with members of both parties to get legislation that works out of the Congress. The first bill will allow us to use military commissions to try suspected terrorists for war crimes. We need the legislation because the Supreme Court recently ruled that military commissions must be explicitly authorized by Congress. So we're working with Congress. The Supreme Court said, ""You must work with Congress."" We are working with Congress to get a good piece of legislation out.
The bill I have proposed will ensure that suspected terrorists will receive full and fair trials without revealing to them our Nation's sensitive intelligence secrets. As soon as Congress acts on this bill, the man our intelligence agencies believe helped orchestrate the 9/11 attacks can face justice.
The bill would also provide clear rules for our personnel involved in detaining and questioning captured terrorists. The information that the Central Intelligence Agency has obtained by questioning men like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed has provided valuable information and has helped disrupt terrorist plots, including strikes within the United States.
For example, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed described the design of planned attacks of buildings inside the U.S. and how operatives were directed to carry them out. That is valuable information for those of us who have the responsibility to protect the American people. He told us the operatives had been instructed to ensure that the explosives went off at a high— a point that was high enough to prevent people trapped above from escaping. He gave us information that helped uncover Al Qaida cells' efforts to obtain biological weapons.
We've also learned information from the CIA program that has helped stop other plots, including attacks on the U.S. Marine base in East Africa or American consulate in Pakistan or Britain's Heathrow Airport. This program has been one of the most vital tools in our efforts to protect this country. It's been invaluable to our country, and it's invaluable to our allies.
Were it not for this program, our intelligence community believes that Al Qaida and its allies would have succeeded in launching another attack against the American homeland. Making us—giving us information about terrorist plans we couldn't get anywhere else, this program has saved innocent lives. In other words, it's vital. That's why I asked Congress to pass legislation so that our professionals can go forward, doing the duty we expect them to do. Unfortunately, the recent Supreme Court decision put the future of this program in question. That's another reason I went to Congress. We need this legislation to save it.
I am asking Congress to pass a clear law with clear guidelines based on the Detainee Treatment Act that was strongly supported by Senator John McCain. There is a debate about the specific provisions in my bill, and we'll work with Congress to continue to try to find common ground. I have one test for this legislation; I'm going to answer one question as this legislation proceeds, and it's this: The intelligence community must be able to tell me that the bill Congress sends to my desk will allow this vital program to continue. That's what I'm going to ask.
The second bill before Congress would modernize our electronic surveillance laws and provide additional authority for the terrorist surveillance program. I authorized the National Security Agency to operate this vital program in response to the 9/ 11 attacks. It allows us to quickly monitor terrorist communications between someone overseas and someone in the United States, and it's helped detect and prevent attacks on our country. The principle behind this program is clear: When an Al Qaida operative is calling into the United States or out of the country, we need to know who they're calling, why they're calling, and what they're planning.
Both these bills are essential to winning the war on terror. We will work with Congress to get good bills out. We have a duty, we have a duty to work together to give our folks on the frontline the tools necessary to protect America. Time is running out. Congress is set to adjourn in just a few weeks. Congress needs to act wisely and promptly so I can sign good legislation.
And now I'll be glad to answer some questions. Terry [Terence Hunt, Associated Press].
War on Terror/Counterterrorism Efforts
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, former Secretary of State Colin Powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism. If a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former Secretary of State feels this way, don't you think that Americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether you're following a flawed strategy?
The President. If there's any comparison between the compassion and decency of the American people and the terrorist tactics of extremists, it's flawed logic. I simply can't accept that. It's unacceptable to think that there's any kind of comparison between the behavior of the United States of America and the action of Islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective, Terry.
My job, and the job of people here in Washington, DC, is to protect this country. We didn't ask for this war. You might remember the 2000 campaign. I don't remember spending much time talking about what it might be like to be a Commander in Chief in a different kind of war. But this enemy has struck us, and they want to strike us again. And we will give our folks the tools necessary to protect the country; that's our job.
It's a dangerous world. I wish it wasn't that way. I wish I could tell the American people, ""Don't worry about it; they're not coming again."" But they are coming again. And that's why I've sent this legislation up to Congress, and that's why we'll continue to work with allies in building a vast coalition to protect not only ourselves but them. The facts are—is that after 9/11, this enemy continued to attack and kill innocent people.
I happen to believe that they're bound by a common ideology. Matter of fact, I don't believe that, I know they are. And they want to impose that ideology throughout the broader Middle East. That's what they have said. It makes sense for the Commander in Chief and all of us involved in protecting this country to listen to the words of the enemy. And I take their words seriously. And that's what's going to be necessary to protect this country, is to listen carefully to what they say and stay ahead of them as they try to attack us.
Steve [Steve Holland, Reuters].
Q. Can I just follow up?
The President. No, you can't. Steve. If we follow up, we're not going to get—I want Hillman [G. Robert Hillman, Dallas Morning News] to be able to ask a question. It's his last press conference—not yet, Hillman. [Laughter] Soon. You and Wendell seem——
""Military Commissions Act of 2006""
Q. Thank you very much, sir. What do you say to the argument that your proposal is basically seeking support for torture, coerced evidence, and secret hearings? And Senator McCain says your plan will put U.S. troops at risk. What do you think about that?
The President. This debate is occurring because of the Supreme Court's ruling that said that we must conduct ourselves under the Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention. And that Common Article Three says that there will be no outrages upon human dignity. It's very vague. What does that mean, ""outrages upon human dignity""? That's a statement that is wide open to interpretation. And what I'm proposing is that there be clarity in the law so that our professionals will have no doubt that that which they are doing is legal. You know, it's—and so the piece of legislation I sent up there provides our professionals that which is needed to go forward.
The first question that we've got to ask is, do we need the program? I believe we do need the program. And I detailed in a speech in the East Room what the program has yield—in other words, the kind of information we get when we interrogate people within the law. You see, sometimes you can pick up information on the battlefield; sometimes you can pick it up through letters; but sometimes you actually have to question the people who know the strategy and plans of the enemy. And in this case, we questioned people like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who we believe ordered the attacks on 9/11, or Ramzi bin al-Shibh or Abu Zubaydah, coldblooded killers who were part of planning the attack that killed 3,000 people. And we need to be able to question them, because it helps yield information, information necessary for us to be able to do our job.
Now, the Court said that you've got to live under Article 3 of the Geneva Convention, and the standards are so vague that our professionals won't be able to carry forward the program, because they don't want to be tried as war criminals. They don't want to break the law. These are decent, honorable citizens who are on the frontline of protecting the American people, and they expect our Government to give them clarity about what is right and what is wrong in the law. And that's what we have asked to do.
And we believe a good way to go is to use the amendment that we worked with John McCain on, called the Detainee Treatment Act, as the basis for clarity for people we would ask to question the enemy. In other words, it is a way to bring U.S. law into play. It provides more clarity for our professionals, and that's what these people expect. These are decent citizens who don't want to break the law.
Now, this idea that somehow we've got to live under international treaties, you know—and that's fine; we do; but oftentimes the United States Government passes law to clarify obligations under international treaty. And what I'm concerned about is if we don't do that, then it's very conceivable our professionals could be held to account based upon court decisions in other countries. And I don't believe Americans want that. I believe Americans want us to protect the country, to have clear standards for our law enforcement, intelligence officers, and give them the tools necessary to protect us within the law.
It's an important debate, Steve. It really is. It's a debate that really is going to define whether or not we can protect ourselves. I will tell you this: I've spent a lot of time on this issue, as you can imagine, and I've talked to professionals, people I count on for advice; these are people that are going to represent those on the frontline of protecting this country. They're not going forward with the program. They're not going—the professionals will not step up unless there's clarity in the law. So Congress has got a decision to make: Do you want the program to go forward or not?
I strongly recommend that this program go forward in order for us to be able to protect America.
Hillman. This is Hillman's last press conference, so—sorry, sorry, about that.
Immigration Reform
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. On another of your top priorities, immigration, leaders of both parties have indicated that any chance of comprehensive immigration reform is dead before the election. Is this an issue you would like to revisit in a lame-duck session after the election? Or would it be put off until the new Congress?
The President. Bob, I strongly believe that in order to protect this border, Congress has got to pass a comprehensive plan that on the one hand provides additional money to secure the border and on the other hand recognizes that people are sneaking in here to do jobs Americans aren't doing. It would be better that they not sneak in, that they would come on a temporary basis, in an orderly way, to do work Americans aren't doing and then go home. And I will continue to urge Congress to think comprehensively about this vital piece of legislation.
I went up to the Hill yesterday, and of course this topic came up. It's exactly what I told the Members of Congress. They wanted to know whether or not we were implementing border security measures that they had funded last January, and the answer is, we are. One of the key things I told them was we had ended what's called catch-and-release. That was a—you know, a Border Patrol agent would find somebody, particularly from—not from Mexico, and would say, ""Well, we don't have enough detention space, so why don't you come back and check in with the local person you're supposed to check in with,"" and then they'd never show back up. And that, of course, frustrated the Border Patrol agents; it frustrates American citizens; it frustrates me. And we ended it because Congress appropriated money that increased the number of beds available to detain people when we get them sneaking into our country illegally.
The border has become modernized. And Secretary Chertoff here, later on this month, will be announcing further modernizations, as he has led a contract that will use all kinds of different technologies to make the border more secure. But in the long run, to secure this border, we've got to have a rational work plan.
And finally, we're going to have to treat people with dignity in this country. Ours is a nation of immigrants, and when Congress gets down to a comprehensive bill, I would just remind them, it's virtually impossible to try to find 11 million folks— who have been here, working hard and, in some cases, raising families—and kick them out. It's just not going to work. But granting automatic citizenship won't work either. To me, that would just provide an additional incentive for people to try to sneak in, and so therefore, there is a rational way forward. I'll continue working—I don't know the timetable. My answer is, as soon as possible; that's what I'd like to see done.
Thank you. Let's see, Wendell. Coming your way. Everybody is going to get one.
United Nations/Iran
Q. My apologies, Mr. President, for talking too long at the start.
The President. Don't worry. I'm not going to apologize for talking too long to your answer. [Laughter]
Q. Talk as long as you'd like, sir. [Laughter]
When you go to New York next week, it's our thinking that one of the things you'll be trying to do is to get more international support for taking a tough stance against Iran. I wonder how much that is frustrated by two things: one, the war in Iraq and world criticism of that; and the other, the Iraqi Prime Minister going to Iran and basically challenging your administration's claim that Iran is meddling in Iraqi affairs.
The President. First, Wendell, my decision, along with other countries, to remove Saddam Hussein has obviously created some concern amongst allies, but it certainly hasn't diminished the coalitions we put together to deal with radicalism. For example, there's 70 nations involved with the Proliferation Security Initiative, and that's an initiative to help prevent weapons of mass destruction and/or component parts from being delivered to countries that could use them to hurt us; or the broad war on terror, the intelligence sharing or financial—sharing of financial information; or Afghanistan, where NATO troops are there now, along with ours.
In other words, there's a broad coalition. Most nations recognize the threat of Iran having a nuclear weapon in the middle of the Middle East. And there's common consensus that we need to work together to prevent the Iranian regime from developing that nuclear weapons program.
I am pleased that there is strong consensus. And now the objective is to continue reminding the Iranian regime that there is unanimity in the world and that we will move forward together. And we expect them to come to the table and negotiate with the EU in good faith. And should they choose to verifiably suspend their program, their enrichment program, we'll come to the table. That's what we have said; offer still stands.
During the Hizballah attacks on Israel, the United Nations did pass a resolution with our European friends and ourselves and, of course, Russia and China voting for the resolution. I think it passed 14 to 1; one nation voted against the resolution toward Iran. So there is common consensus. And you've heard me lament oftentimes, it takes a while to get diplomacy working. There's one nation of Iran and a bunch of nations like us trying to kind of head in the same direction. And my concern is that they'll stall; they'll try to wait us out.
So part of my objective in New York is to remind people that stalling shouldn't be allowed. In other words, we need to move the process. And they need to understand we're firm in our commitment, and if they try to drag their feet or get us to look the other way, that we won't do that, that we're firmly committed in our desire to send a common signal to the Iranian regime.
It is important for the Iranian people to also understand we respect them; we respect their history; we respect their traditions; we respect the right for people to worship freely; we would hope that people would be able to express themselves in the public square; and that our intention is to make the world safer. And we'll continue to do so.

Iran's Nuclear Enrichment Program
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. If I could follow up on that question.
The President. Yes.
Q. Mahmud Ahmadi-nejad, the Iranian President, will actually be in the same building as you next week, in Manhattan for the United Nations General Assembly. You say that you want to give the message to the Iranian people that you respect them. Is this not an opportunity, perhaps, to show that you also respect their leader? Would you be willing to, perhaps, meet face to face with Ahmadi-nejad, and would this possibly be a breakthrough, some sort of opportunity for a breakthrough on a personal level?
The President. No, I'm not going to meet with him. I have made it clear to the Iranian regime that we will sit down with the Iranians once they verifiably suspend their enrichment program. And I meant what I said.
Martha.
Saddam Hussein
Q. Mr. President, you have said throughout the war in Iraq and building up to the war in Iraq that there was a relationship between Saddam Hussein and Zarqawi and Al Qaida. A Senate Intelligence Committee report a few weeks ago said there was no link, no relationship, and that the CIA knew this and issued a report last fall. And yet a month ago, you were still saying there was a relationship. Why did you keep saying that? Why do you continue to say that? And do you still believe that?
The President. The point I was making to Ken Herman's [Austin American-Statesman] question was that Saddam Hussein was a state sponsor of terror and that Mr. Zarqawi was in Iraq. He had been wounded in Afghanistan, had come to Iraq for treatment. He had ordered the killing of a U.S. citizen in Jordan. I never said there was an operational relationship. I was making the point that Saddam Hussein had been declared a state sponsor of terror for a reason, and therefore, he was dangerous.
The broader point I was saying, I was reminding people was why we removed Saddam Hussein from power. He was dangerous. I would hope people aren't trying to rewrite the history of Saddam Hussein; all of a sudden, he becomes kind of a benevolent fellow. He's a dangerous man. And one of the reasons he was declared a state sponsor of terror was because that's what he was. He harbored terrorists; he paid for families of suicide bombers. Never have I said that Saddam Hussein gave orders to attack 9/11. What I did say was, after 9/11, when you see a threat, you've got to take it seriously. And I saw a threat in Saddam Hussein, as did Congress, as did the United Nations. I firmly believe the world is better off without Saddam in power, Martha.

""Military Commissions Act of 2006""
Q. Sorry, I've got to get disentangled——
The President. Would you like me to go to somebody else here, until you—[laughter].
Q. Sorry.
The President. But take your time, please. [Laughter]
Q. I really apologize for that. Anyway——
The President. I must say, having gone through those gyrations, you're looking beautiful today, Dave. [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President, critics of your proposed bill on interrogation rules say there's another important test—these critics include John McCain, who you've mentioned several times this morning—and that test is this: If a CIA officer, paramilitary or special operations soldier from the United States were captured in Iran or North Korea, and they were roughed up, and those governments said, ""Well, they were interrogated in accordance with our interpretation of the Geneva Conventions,"" and then they were put on trial and they were convicted based on secret evidence that they were not able to see, how would you react to that, as Commander in Chief?
The President. David, my reaction is, is that if the nations such as those you named, adopted the standards within the detainee detention act, the world would be better. That's my reaction. We're trying to clarify law. We're trying to set high standards, not ambiguous standards.
And let me just repeat, Dave, we can debate this issue all we want, but the practical matter is, if our professionals don't have clear standards in the law, the program is not going to go forward. You cannot ask a young intelligence officer to violate the law. And they're not going to. They—let me finish, please—they will not violate the law. You can ask this question all you want, but the bottom line is—and the American people have got to understand this—that this program won't go forward, if there is vague standards applied, like those in Common Article 3 from the Geneva Convention; it's just not going to go forward. You can't ask a young professional on the frontline of protecting this country to violate law.
Now, I know they said they're not going to prosecute them. Think about that: Go ahead and violate it; we won't prosecute you. These people aren't going to do that, Dave. Now, we can justify anything you want and bring up this example or that example; I'm just telling you the bottom line, and that's why this debate is important, and it's a vital debate.
Now, perhaps some in Congress don't think the program is important. That's fine. I don't know if they do or don't. I think it's vital, and I have the obligation to make sure that our professionals who I would ask to go conduct interrogations to find out what might be happening or who might be coming to this country—I got to give them the tools they need. And that is clear law.
Q. But sir, this is an important point, and I think it depends——
The President. The point I just made is the most important point.
Q. Okay.
The President. And that is, the program is not going forward. David, you can give a hypothetical about North Korea or any other country; the point is that the program is not going to go forward if our professionals do not have clarity in the law. And the best way to provide clarity in the law is to make sure the Detainee Treatment Act is the crux of the law. That's how we define Common Article 3, and it sets a good standard for the countries that you just talked about.
Next man.
Q. No, but wait a second, I think this is an important point——
The President. I know you think it's an important point.
Q. Sir, with respect, if other countries interpret the Geneva Conventions as they see fit—as they see fit—you're saying that you'd be okay with that?
The President. I am saying that I would hope that they would adopt the same standards we adopt, and that by clarifying Article 3, we make it stronger; we make it clearer; we make it definite.
And I will tell you again, David, you can ask every hypothetical you want, but the American people have got to know the facts. And the bottom line is simple: If Congress passes a law that does not clarify the rules—if they do not do that, the program is not going forward.
Q. This will not endanger U.S. troops, in your——
The President. Next man.
Q. This will not endanger U.S. troops——
The President. David, next man, please. Thank you. It took you a long time to unravel, and it took you a long time to ask your question.
Democracy Efforts in Iraq/Insurgency and Terrorist Attacks
Q. Morning, sir. I'd like to ask you another question about Iraq. It's been another bloody day there. The last several weeks have been 40, 50, 60 bodies a day. We've been talking for the last several months about Iraq being on the brink of a civil war. I'd like to ask you if it's not time to start talking about Iraq as being in a civil war, and if it's not, what's the threshold?
The President. Well, it seems like it's pretty easy to speculate from over here about the conditions on the ground. And so what I do is I talk to people like our Ambassador and General Casey, which I just did this morning. And they and the Iraqi Government just don't agree with the hypothesis it is a civil war. They believe that there's, no question, violence; they believe that Al Qaida is still creating havoc; they know there's people taking reprisal; they're confident there are still Saddamists who are threatening people and carrying out attacks.
But they also believe that the Baghdad security plan is making progress. There was a lot of discussion about Al Anbar Province recently, and I spent some time talking with our commanders. No question, it's a dangerous place. It's a place where Al Qaida is really trying to root themselves; it's a place from which they'd like to operate. You know, this business about Al Qaida, Al Anbar's loss is just not the case; it's not what our commanders think.
So to answer your question, there's no question, it's tough. What I look for is whether or not the unity Government is moving forward, whether or not they have a political plan to resolve issues such as oil and federalism, whether or not they're willing to reconcile, and whether or not Iraqi troops and Iraqi police are doing their jobs.
Q. But how do you measure progress with a body count like that?
The President. Well, one way you do it is you measure progress based upon the resilience of the Iraqi people: Do they want there to be a unity government, or are they splitting up into factions of people warring with the head leaders, with different alternatives of governing styles and different philosophies? The unity Government is intact. It's working forward. They're making tough decisions, and we'll stay with them. We'll stay with them because success in Iraq is important for this country. We're constantly changing our tactics. We're constantly adapting to the enemy. We're constantly saying, ""Here's the way forward; we want to work with you."" But this is really the big challenge of the 21st century, whether or not this country and allies are willing to stand with moderate people in order to fight off extremists. It is the challenge.
I said the other night in a speech, this is like the ideological war of the 21st century, and I believe it. And I believe that if we leave that region, if we don't help democracy prevail, then our children and grandchildren will be faced with an unbelievable chaotic and dangerous situation in the Middle East. Imagine an enemy that can't stand what we believe in getting a hold of oil resources and taking a bunch of oil off the market in order to have an economic punishment. In other words, they say, ""You go ahead and do this, and if you don't, we'll punish you economically."" Or imagine a Middle East with an Iran with a nuclear weapon threatening free nations and trying to promote their vision of extremism through Hizballah.
I find it interesting that young democracies are being challenged by extremists. I also take great hope in the fact that, by far, the vast majority of people want normalcy and want peace, including in Iraq; that there is a deep desire for people to raise their children in a peaceful world; the desire for mothers to have the best for their child. And it's ","not—this isn't— you know, Americans—you've got to understand, this is universal. And the idea of just saying, well, that's not important for us—to me—or the future of the country, it's just not acceptable.
And I know it's tough in Iraq. Of course it's tough in Iraq, because an enemy is trying to stop this new democracy, just like people are trying to stop the development of a Palestinian state, which I strongly support, or people trying to undermine the Lebanese democracy. And the reason why is because the ideologues understand that liberty will trump their dark vision of the world every time. And that's why I call it an ideological struggle. And it's a necessary struggle, and it's a vital struggle.
Richard [Richard Benedetto, USA Today].
United Nations
Q. Mr. President, as you prepare to go up to the United Nations next week to address the General Assembly, Secretary Kofi Annan has been critical of some of U.S. policies, particularly in Afghanistan, lately. How would you characterize the relationship between the United States and the United Nations at this point?
The President. Yes. First of all, my personal relationship with Kofi Annan is good. I like him. And we've got a good relationship, personal relationship. I think a lot of Americans are frustrated with the United Nations, to be frank with you. Take, for example, Darfur—I'm frustrated with the United Nations in regards to Darfur. I have said and this Government has said, there's genocide taking place in the Sudan. And it breaks our collective hearts to know that.
We believe that the best way to solve the problem is there be a political track as well as a security track. And part of the security track was for there initially to be African Union forces supported by the international community, hopefully to protect innocent lives from militia. And the AU force is there, but it needs—it's not robust enough. It needs to be bigger. It needs to be more viable.
And so the strategy was then to go to the United Nations and pass a resolution enabling the AU force to become blue-helmeted—that means, become a United Nations peacekeeping force—with additional support from around the world. And I suggested that there also be help from NATO nations in logistics and support in order to make the security effective enough so that a political process could go forward to save lives.
The problem is, is that the United Nations hasn't acted. And so I can understand why those who are concerned about Darfur are frustrated; I am. I'd like to see more robust United Nations action. What you'll hear is, ""Well, the Government of Sudan must invite the United Nations in for us to act."" Well, there are other alternatives, like passing a resolution saying, we're coming in with a U.N. force in order to save lives.
I'm proud of our country's support for those who suffer. We've provided, by far, the vast majority of food and aid. I'm troubled by reports I hear about escalating violence. I can understand the desperation people feel for women being pulled out of these refugee centers and raped. And now is the time for the U.N. to act.
So you asked if there are levels of frustration; there's a particular level of frustration. I also believe that the United Nations can do a better job spending the taxpayer— our taxpayers' money. I think there needs to be better management structures in place, better accountability in the organization. I hope the United Nations still strongly stands for liberty. I hope they would support my call to end tyranny in the 21st century.
So I'm looking forward to going up there to—it's always an interesting experience, Richard, for a west Texas fellow to speak to the United Nations. And I'm going to have a strong message, one that's hope— based upon hope and my belief that the civilized world must stand with moderate reformist-minded people and help them realize their dreams. I believe that's the call of the 21st century.
Let's see, who else? The front row people have all asked. Hutch [Ron Hutcheson, Knight Ridder].
Terrorist Surveillance Program
Q. Good morning.
The President. Good morning. Thank you.
Q. On both the eavesdropping program and the detainee issues——
The President. We call it the terrorist surveillance program, Hutch.
Q. That's the one.
The President. Yes.
Q. You're working with Congress sort of after the fact, after you established these programs on your own authority. And Federal courts have ruled in both cases, you overstepped your authority. Is your willingness to work with Congress now an acknowledgment that that is a fact?
The President. First of all, I strongly believe that the district court ruling on the terrorist surveillance program was flawed. And there's a court process to determine whether or not my belief is true. That's why it's on appeal. We're working with Congress to add certainty to the program.
In terms of the Hamdan decision, I obviously believed that I could move forward with military commissions. Other Presidents had. The Supreme Court didn't agree, and they said, ""Work with Congress."" And that's why we're working with Congress.
McKinnon [John McKinnon, Wall Street Journal].
National Economy/2006 Midterm Elections
Q. Thank you, sir. Polls show that many people are still more focused on domestic issues like the economy than on the international issues in deciding how to vote in November. And I'd just like to ask you if you could contrast what you think will happen on the economy if Republicans retain control of Congress versus what happens on the economy if Democrats take over?
The President. If I weren't here—first of all, I don't believe the Democrats are going to take over, because our record on the economy is strong. If the American people would take a step back and realize how effective our policies have been, given the circumstances, they will continue to embrace our philosophy of government. We've overcome recession, attacks, hurricanes, scandals, and the economy is growing, 4.7 percent unemployment rate. It's been a strong economy. And I've strongly believed the reason it is because we cut taxes and, at the same time, showed fiscal responsibility here in Washington, with the people's money. That's why the deficit could be cut in half by 2009 or before.
And so I shouldn't answer your hypothetical, but I will. I believe if the Democrats had the capacity to, they would raise taxes on the working people. That's what I believe. They'll call it tax on the rich, but that's not the way it works in Washington, see. For example, running up the top income tax bracket would tax small businesses. A lot of small businesses are subchapter S corporations or limited partnerships that pay tax at the individual level. And if you raise income taxes on them, you hurt job creation. Our answer to economic growth is to make the tax cuts permanent so there's certainty in the Tax Code and people have got money to spend in their pockets.
And so yes, I've always felt the economy is a determinate issue, if not the determinate issue in campaigns. We've had a little history of that in our family and— [laughter]—you might remember. But it's a—I certainly hope this election is based upon economic performance.
Let's see here, kind of working my way— yes, Mark [Mark Silva, Chicago Tribune].
USA PATRIOT Act
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd also like to ask an election-related question. The Republican leader in the House this week said that Democrats—he wonders if they are more interested in protecting the terrorists than protecting the American people. Do you agree with him, sir? And do you think that's the right tone to set for this upcoming campaign, or do you think he owes somebody an apology?
The President. I wouldn't have exactly put it that way. But I do believe there's a difference of attitude. I mean, take the PATRIOT Act, for example—an interesting debate that took place, not once, but twice, and the second time around there was a lot of concern about whether or not the PATRIOT Act was necessary to protect the country. There's no doubt in my mind we needed to make sure the PATRIOT Act was renewed to tear down walls that exist so that intelligence people could serve— could share information with criminal people. It wasn't the case, Mark, before 9/11.
In other words, if somebody had some intelligence that they thought was necessary to protect the people, they couldn't share that with somebody who's job it was to rout people out of society to prevent them from attacking. It just made no sense. And so there was a healthy debate, and we finally got the PATRIOT Act extended after it was passed right after 9/11. To me, it was an indication of just a difference of approach.
No one should ever question the patriotism of somebody who—let me just start over. I don't question the patriotism of somebody who doesn't agree with me; I just don't. And I think it's unwise to do that. I don't think that's what leaders do. I do think that—I think that there is a difference of opinion here in Washington about tools necessary to protect the country—the terrorist surveillance program—or what did you call it, Hutcheson? Yes, the illegal eavesdropping program is what you wanted to call it—[laughter]—IEP as opposed to TSP. [Laughter] There's just a difference of opinion about what we need to do to protect our country, Mark. I'm confident the leader, you know, meant nothing personal. I know that he shares my concern that we pass good legislation to get something done.
Ken.
Former Governor Ann Richards of Texas
Q. Thank you, sir. I'd be interested in your thoughts and remembrances about Ann Richards, and particularly what you learned in running against her 12 years ago.
The President. Yes. Obviously, Laura and I pray for her family. I know this is a tough time for her children. She loved her children, and they loved her a lot.
Running against Ann Richards taught me a lot. She was a really, really good candidate. She was a hard worker. She had the capacity to be humorous and yet make a profound point. I think she made a positive impact on the State of Texas. One thing is for certain: She empowered a lot of people to be—to want to participate in the political process that might not have felt that they were welcome in the process.
I'll miss her. She was a—she really kind of helped define Texas politics in its best way. And one of the things we have done is we've—in our history, we've had characters, people larger than life, people that could fill the stage; when the spotlight was on them, wouldn't shirk from the spotlight but would talk Texan and explain our State. And she was really good at that.
And so I'm sad she passed away, and I wish her family all the best—and all her friends. She had a lot of friends in Texas. A lot of people loved Ann Richards.
And anyway, as I understand, they're working on the deal and how to honor her, and she'll be lying in state in the capitol, and——
Q. Will you be sending anybody to——
The President. Yes, I will send somebody to represent me. I don't know who it is going to be yet. Well, we're trying to get the details. Before I ask somebody, I've got to find out the full details.
Thanks for asking the question. Let's see, New York Times, Sheryl [Sheryl Gay Stolberg].
""Military Commissions Act of 2006""
Q. Hi, Mr. President.
The President. Fine. How are you doing?
Q. I'm well today. Thank you. [Laughter]
The President. Did you start with, ""Hi, Mr. President""?
Q. Hello, Mr. President.
The President. Okay, that's fine. Either way, that's always a friendly greeting. Thank you.
Q. We're a friendly newspaper.
The President. Yes. [Laughter] Let me just say, I'd hate to see unfriendly. [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Want me to go on to somebody else and you collect your— [laughter]. Sorry, go ahead, Sheryl.
Q. Mr. President, your administration had all summer to negotiate with lawmakers on the detainee legislation. How is it that you now find yourself in a situation where you have essentially an open rebellion on Capitol Hill led by some of the leading members of your own party, very respected voices in military affairs? And secondly, would you veto the bill if it passes in the form that the Armed Services Committee approved yesterday?
The President. First, we have been working throughout the summer, talking to key players about getting a bill that will enable the program to go forward, and was pleased that the House of Representatives passed a good bill with an overwhelming bipartisan majority out of their committee, the Armed Services Committee. And I felt that was good progress. And obviously, we've got a little work to do in the Senate, and we'll continue making our case. But, no, we've been involved—ever since the Supreme Court decision came down, Sheryl, we've been talking about both the military tribunals and this Article 3 of the Geneva Convention.
The Article 3 of the Geneva Convention is hard for a lot of citizens to understand. But let's see if I can put it this way for people to understand. There is a very vague standard that the Court said must kind of be the guide for our conduct in the war on terror and the detainee policy. It's so vague that it's impossible to ask anybody to participate in the program for fear— for that person having the fear of breaking the law. That's the problem.
And so we worked with members of both bodies and both parties to try to help bring some definition to Common Article 3. I really don't think most Americans want international courts being able to determine how we protect ourselves. And my assurance to people is that we can pass law here in the United States that helps define our treaty—international treaty obligations. We have done that in the past. It is not the first time that we have done this. And I believe it's necessary to do it this time in order for the program to go forward. Peter [Peter Baker, Washington Post].
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Sheryl's second question was whether you would veto the bill as it passed yesterday.
The President. Oh, I don't—that's like saying, can you work with a Democrat Congress, when I don't think the Democrat Congress is going to get elected. I believe we can get a good bill. And there is— as you know, there's several steps in this process. The House will be working on a bill next week—the Senate will be. Hopefully, we can reconcile differences. Hopefully, we can come together and find a way forward without ruining the program.
So your question was Sheryl's question?
Q. No, sir.
The President. Oh, you were following up on Sheryl's question?
Q. Yes, sir.
The President. That's a first. [Laughter]
Iraqi Military and Security Forces/U.S. Armed Forces
Q. We're a friendly paper too. [Laughter]
Mr. President, you've often used the phrase ""stand up/stand down,"" to describe your policy when it comes to troop withdrawals from Iraq—as Iraqi troops are trained and take over the fight, American troops will come home. The Pentagon now says they've trained 294,000 Iraqi troops and expect to complete their program of training 325,000 by the end of the year. But American troops aren't coming home, and there are more there now than there were previously. Is the goalpost moving, sir?
The President. No, no. The enemy is changing tactics, and we're adapting. That's what's happening. And I asked General Casey today, ""Have you got what you need?"" He said, ""Yes, I've got what I need.""
We all want the troops to come home as quickly as possible. But they'll be coming home when our commanders say the Iraqi Government is capable of defending itself and sustaining itself and is governing itself. And you know, I was hoping we would have—be able to—hopefully, Casey would come and say, you know, ""Mr. President, there's a chance to have fewer troops there."" It looked like that might be the case, until the violence started rising in Baghdad, and it spiked in June and July, as you know—or increased in June and July.
And so they've got a plan now. They've adapted. The enemy moved; we'll help the Iraqis move. And so they're building a berm around the city to make it harder for people to come in with explosive devices, for example. They're working different neighborhoods inside of Baghdad to collect guns and bring people to detention. They've got a ""clear, build, and hold"" strategy.
The reason why there are not fewer troops there, but are more—you're right; it's gone from 135,000 to about 147,000, I think, or 140-something thousand troops—is because George Casey felt he needed them to help the Iraqis achieve their objective.
And that's the way I will continue to conduct the war. I'll listen to generals. Maybe it's not the politically expedient thing to do, is to increase troops coming into an election, but we just can't—you can't make decisions based upon politics about how to win a war. And the fundamental question you have to ask—and Martha knows what I'm about to say—is, can the President trust his commanders on the ground to tell him what is necessary? That's really one of the questions.
In other words, if you say, ""I'm going to rely upon their judgment,"" the next question is, how good is their judgment, or is my judgment good enough to figure out whether or not they know what they're doing? And I'm going to tell you, I've got great confidence in General John Abizaid and General George Casey. These are extraordinary men who understand the difficulties of the task and understand there is a delicate relationship between self-sufficiency on the Iraqis' part and U.S. presence.
And this is not a science but an art form in a way, to try to make sure that a unity government is able to defend itself and, at the same time, not be totally reliant upon coalition forces to do the job for them. And the issue is complicated by the fact that there are still Al Qaida or Saddam remnants or militias that are still violent. And so to answer your question, the policy still holds. The ""stand up/stand down"" still holds, and so does the policy of me listening to our commanders to give me the judgment necessary for troop levels.

Usama bin Laden/Pakistan's Role in the War on Terror
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Earlier this week, you told a group of journalists that you thought the idea of sending Special Forces to Pakistan to hunt down bin Laden was a strategy that would not work.
The President. Yes.
Q. Now recently you've also——
The President. It's because, first of all, Pakistan is a sovereign nation.
Q. Well, recently you've also described bin Laden as a sort of modern day Hitler or Mussolini. And I'm wondering why— if you can explain why you think it's a bad idea to send more resources to hunt down bin Laden, wherever he is?
The President. We are, Richard. Thank you. Thanks for asking the question. They were asking me about somebody's report, well, Special Forces here—Pakistan—if he is in Pakistan, which this person thought he might be, who is asking the question— Pakistan is a sovereign nation. In order for us to send thousands of troops into a sovereign nation, we've got to be invited by the Government of Pakistan.
Secondly, the best way to find somebody who is hiding is to enhance your intelligence and to spend the resources necessary to do that. Then when you find him, you bring him to justice. And there is a kind of an urban myth here in Washington about how this administration hasn't stayed focused on Usama bin Laden. Forget it. It's convenient throw-away lines when people say that. We have been on the hunt, and we'll stay on the hunt until we bring him to justice. And we're doing it in a smart fashion, Richard, we are.
And I look forward to talking to President Musharraf. Look, he doesn't like Al Qaida. They tried to kill him. And we've had a good record of bringing people to justice inside of Pakistan, because the Paks are in the lead. They know the stakes about dealing with a violent form of ideological extremists.
And so we will continue on the hunt. And we've been effective about bringing to justice most of those who planned and plotted the 9/11 attacks, and we've still got a lot of pressure on them. The best way to protect the homeland is to stay on the offense and keep pressure on them.
Last question. Allen.
American Culture
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. It was reported earlier this week that in a meeting with conservative journalists, you said you'd seen changes in the culture. You referred to it as a ""Third Awakening."" I wonder if you could tell us about—what you meant by that, what led you to that conclusion? And do you see any contradictory evidence in the culture?
The President. No, I said—Mike, thanks. I was just speculating that the culture might be changing, and I was talking about when you're involved with making decisions of historic nature, you won't be around to see the effects of your decisions. And I said that when I work the ropelines, a lot of people come and say, ""Mr. President, I'm praying for you""—a lot. As a matter of fact, it seems like a lot more now than when I was working ropelines in 1994. And I asked them—I was asking their opinion about whether or not there was a ""Third Awakening,"" I called it.
I'd just read a book on Abraham Lincoln, and his Presidency was right around the time of what they called the Second Awakening, and I was curious to know whether or not these smart people felt like there was any historical parallels. I also said that I had run for office the first time to change a culture—Herman and Hutch remember me saying, you know, the culture that said, ""If it feels good, do it, and if you've got a problem, blame somebody else""—to helping to work change a culture in which each of us are responsible for the decisions we make in life. In other words, ushering in a responsibility era. And I reminded people that responsibility means, if you're a father, love your child; or if you're corporate America, be honest with the taxpayers; if you're a citizen of this country, love your neighbor.
And so I was wondering out loud with them. It seems like to me that something is happening in the religious life of America. But I'm not a very good focus group either. I'm encapsulated here. I'm able to see a lot of people, and from my perspective, people are coming to say, ""I'm praying for you."" And it's an uplifting part of being the President; it inspires me. And I'm grateful that a fellow citizen would say a prayer for me and Laura.
Anyway, thank you all very much."
"February 14, 2007",The President's News Conference,George W. Bush,"George W. Bush, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/270604",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference,"The President. Thank you all. Please be seated. Thanks for coming in on an icy day. I have just finished a conversation with General David Petraeus. He gave me his first briefing from Iraq. He talked about the Baghdad security plan. It's the plan that I described to the Nation last January, and it's a plan that's beginning to take shape. General Petraeus and General Odierno talked about how the fact that the Iraqi Government is following through on its commitment to deploy three additional army brigades, Iraqi Army brigades in the capital. We talked about where those troops are being deployed, the position of U.S. troops with them, as well as the ""embeds"" with the Iraqi troops. And we talked about the plan.
He also talked about the new Iraqi commander. The commander who Prime Minister Maliki picked to operate the Baghdad security plan is in place. They're setting up a headquarters, and they're in the process of being in a position to be able to coordinate all forces. In other words, there's still some work to be done there to get the command and control center up and running in Baghdad.
We talked about the fact that our coalition troops that are heading into Baghdad will be arriving on time. In other words, I'm paying attention to the schedule of troop deployments to make sure that they're there, so that General Petraeus will have the troops to do the job—the number of troops to do the job that we've asked him to do.
We talked about the coordination between Iraqi and coalition forces. And I would characterize their assessment as—the coordination is good. In other words, there's good conversation, constant conversation between the commanders of our troops and their troops, and that's a positive development.
The operation to secure Baghdad is going to take time, and there will be violence. As we saw on our TV screens, the terrorists will send car bombs into crowded markets. In other words, these are people that will kill innocent men, women, and children to achieve their objective, which is to discourage the Iraqi people, to foment sectarian violence, and to frankly discourage us from helping this Government do its job.
Yesterday there was a suicide bomber. In other words, there's an active strategy to undermine the Maliki Government and its Baghdad security plan. And our generals understand that; they know that they're all aimed at frankly causing people here in America to say it's not worth it. And I can understand why people are concerned when they turn on the TV screens and see this violence. It's disturbing to people, and it's disturbing to the Iraqi people. But it reminds me of how important it is for us to help them succeed. If you think the violence is bad now, imagine what it would look like if we don't help them secure the city—the capital city of Baghdad.
I fully recognize we're not going to be able to stop all suicide bombers; I know that. But we can help secure that capital, help the Iraqis secure that capital so that people have a sense of normalcy, in other words, that they're able to get a better sense that this Government of theirs will provide security. People want to live in peace; they want to grow up in a peaceful environment. And the decision I made is going to help the Iraqi Government do that.
When General Petraeus's nomination was considered 3 weeks ago, the United States Senate voted unanimously to confirm him, and I appreciated that vote by the Senators. And now Members of the House of Representatives are debating a resolution that would express disapproval of the plan that General Petraeus is carrying out. You know, in recent months, I've discussed our strategy in Iraq with Members of Congress from both political parties. Many have told me that they're dissatisfied with the situation in Iraq. I told them I was dissatisfied with the situation in Iraq. And that's why I ordered a comprehensive review of our strategy.
I've listened to a lot of voices; people in my administration heard a lot of voices. We weighed every option, and I concluded that to step back from the fight in Baghdad would have disastrous consequences for people in America. That's the conclusion I came to; it's the conclusion members of my staff came to; it's the conclusion that a lot in the military came to.
And the reason why I say ""disastrous consequences,"" the Iraqi Government could collapse; chaos would spread; there would be a vacuum; into the vacuum would flow more extremists, more radicals, people who have stated intent to hurt our people. I believe that success in Baghdad will have success in helping us secure the homeland.
What's different about this conflict than some others is that if we fail there, the enemy will follow us here. I firmly believe that. And that's one of the main reasons why I made the decision I made. And so we will help this Iraqi Government succeed.
And the first step for success is to do something about the sectarian violence in Baghdad so they can have breathing space in order to do the political work necessary to assure the different factions in Baghdad—factions that are recovering from years of tyranny—that there is a hopeful future for them and their families. I would call that political breathing space. And by providing this political breathing space—in other words, giving the Maliki Government a chance to reconcile and do the work necessary to achieve reconciliation—it'll hasten the day in which we can change our force posture in Iraq.
A successful strategy obviously—a successful security strategy in Baghdad requires more than just military action. I mean, people have to see tangible results in their lives. I mean, they have to see something better. They not only have to feel secure where they live, but they've got to see positive things taking place.
The other day, the Iraqi Government passed a $41 billion budget, 10 billion of which is for reconstruction and capital investment. There's a lot of talk in Washington about benchmarks. I agree, ""benchmarks"" meaning that the Iraqi Government said they're going to do this, for example, have an oil law as a benchmark. But one of the benchmarks they laid out, besides committing troops to the Iraqi security plan, was that they'll pass a budget in which there's $10 billion of their own money available for reconstruction and help. And they met the benchmark, and now, obviously, it's important they spend the money wisely.
They're in the process of finalizing a law that will allow for the sharing of all revenues among Iraq's peoples. In my talks with Members of Congress, some have agreed with what I'm doing; many who didn't—they all, though, believe it's important for the Iraqi Government to set benchmarks and achieve those benchmarks. And one benchmark we've all discussed was, making it clear to the Iraqi people that they have a stake in the future of their country by having a stake in the oil revenues. And so the Government is in the process of getting an oil revenue law that will help unify the country.
The Iraqi Government is making progress on reforms that will allow more of its citizens to reenter political life. Obviously, I'm paying close attention to whether or not the Government is meeting these benchmarks, and will continue to remind Prime Minister Maliki that he must do so.
We've given our civilians and commanders greater flexibility to fund our economic assistance money. Part of the strategy in Baghdad is to clear and then to hold and then to build. We've been pretty good about clearing in the past; we haven't been good about holding, ""we"" being the Iraqis and coalition forces. So we spent time today talking to General Petraeus about the need—his need and his understanding of the need to hold neighborhoods so that the people themselves in the capital city feel more secure.
But also part of the strategy is to make sure that we build. And so we're giving our commanders flexibility with reconstruction money that they have at their disposal. We're also sending more PRTs, Provincial Reconstruction Teams, into Iraq. We're trying to speed up their arrival into Iraq so that the Iraqi people see tangible benefits from the Government that they elected under one of the most progressive Constitutions in the Middle East.
Later this week, the House of Representatives will vote on a resolution that opposes our new plan in Iraq, before it has a chance to work. People are prejudging the outcome of this. They have every right to express their opinion, and it is a nonbinding resolution. Soon Congress is going to be able to vote on a piece of legislation that is binding, a bill providing emergency funding for our troops. Our troops are counting on their elected leaders in Washington, DC, to provide them with the support they need to do their mission. We have a responsibility, all of us here in Washington, to make sure that our men and women in uniform have the resources and the flexibility they need to prevail.
Before I'm going to take some questions, I'd like to comment about one other diplomatic development, and that took place in the Far East. At the six-party talks in Beijing, North Korea agreed to specific actions that will bring us closer to a Korea Peninsula that is free of nuclear weapons. Specifically, North Korea agreed that within 60 days, it will shut down and seal all operations at the primary nuclear facilities it has used to produce weapons-grade plutonium. It has agreed to allow international inspectors to verify and monitor this progress. It is committed to disclosing all of its nuclear programs as an initial step toward abandoning these programs.
In exchange, five other parties at the table—that would be China, Russia, Japan, South Korea, and the United States—have got commitments. We will meet those commitments as this agreement is honored. Those commitments include economic, humanitarian, and energy assistance to the people of North Korea.
This is a unique deal. First of all, unlike any other agreement, it brings together all of North Korea's neighbors in the region as well as the United States. The agreement is backed by a United Nations Security Council resolution. That resolution came about—the sanctions came about as a result of the resolution because of a unanimous vote on the Security Council.
This is good progress. It is a good first step. There's a lot of work to be done to make sure that the commitments made in this agreement become a reality, but I believe it's an important step in the right direction.
And with that, I'll be glad to take your questions, starting with you, Terry [Terence Hunt, Associated Press].
Russia-U.S. Relations
Q. Mr. President, on Russia, is the Vladimir Putin who said, ""The United States is undermining global security and provoking a new arms race,"" the same Vladimir Putin whose soul you looked into and found to be trustworthy? Has he changed? Are U.S.-Russian relations deteriorating?
The President. I think the person who I was referring to in 2001 is the same strong-willed person. He is a person with whom I have had agreements and disagreements throughout the course of my Presidency and his. We've disagreed on the utility of NATO. I've tried to convince Vladimir that NATO is positive; it's a positive influence; that democracies on your border are good things to have. Democracies tend not to fight each other. And I firmly believe NATO is a stabilizing influence for the good, and that helps Russia. Evidently, he disagrees with that assessment; part of his speech was expressing concerns about NATO.
There's a lot we can work together on, and that's what's important for American people to understand. We know that we've got common goals that make sense for both our peoples. Two such goals are Iran, convincing the Iranians to get rid of its nuclear weapons. And Russia's leadership on this issue is very important to getting a Chapter VII resolution out of the United Nations. And by the way, they were constructive, in terms of the resolution I just described about North Korea. In other words, where we have common interests and we work together on those common interests, we can accomplish important things for the security of our own people as well as the security of the world.
And secondly, Russia and the United States work very closely on proliferation concerns. We're both concerned about the proliferation of technologies that could end up hurting our people and other people in the world.
And so there's—it's a complicated relationship. It's a relationship in which there are disagreements, but there's also a relationship in which we can find common ground to solve problems. And that's the spirit I'll continue to work with Vladimir Putin on.

Iran/War in Iraq
Q. Thank you, sir. General Pace says that these bombs found in Iraq do not by themselves implicate Iran. What makes you so certain that the highest levels of Tehran's Government is responsible?
The President. Yes——
Q. And how can you retaliate against Iran without risking a war?
The President. What we do know is that the Qods Force was instrumental in providing these deadly IEDs to networks inside of Iraq; we know that. And we also know that the Qods Force is a part of the Iranian Government; that's a known. What we don't know is whether or not the head leaders of Iran ordered the Qods Force to do what they did.
But here's my point: Either they knew or didn't know, and what matters is, is that they're there. What's worse: that the Government knew or that the Government didn't know? But the point I made in my initial speech in the White House about Iraq was, is that we know they're there, and we're going to protect our troops. When we find the networks that are enabling these weapons to end up in Iraq, we will deal with them. If we find agents who are moving these devices into Iraq, we will deal with them. I have put out the command to our troops—I mean, to the people who are commanders that we'll protect the people—the soldiers of the United States and innocent people in Iraq and will continue doing so.
Now, let me step back on Iran itself. We have a comprehensive strategy to deal with Iraq [Iran]. * There's a variety of issues that we have with Iraq [Iran]. * One, of course, is influence inside of Iraq. Another is whether or not they end up with a nuclear weapon. And I believe an Iran with a nuclear weapon would be very dangerous for world peace, and have worked with other nations of like mind. And it turns out, there's a lot of countries in the world that agree with that assessment. After all, we did get a Chapter VII resolution out of the United Nations that included EU-3 as well as Russia and China. That's a positive development.
The message to the Iranian people is, is that your leaders are making decisions that are isolating you in the world, thereby denying you a brighter future. And I believe Iran is a unbelievably vital nation. It's got a great history; it's got wonderful traditions; it's got very capable, smart people. There is—I believe there's also a desire to not be isolated from the world. And our policies are all aimed at convincing the Iranian people there's a better way forward, and I hope their Government hears that message.
Yes, anyway, that's a long answer to a short question, and now you're trying to get to me to another one, aren't you? Gregory [David Gregory, NBC News].
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Excuse me, David— David.
Q. Thank you, sir. I'd like to follow on Iran. Critics say that you are using the same quality of intelligence about Iran that you used to make the case for war in Iraq, specifically about WMD that turned out to be wrong, and that you are doing that to make a case for war against Iran. Is that the case?
The President. I can say with certainty that the Qods Force, a part of the Iranian Government, has provided these sophisticated IEDs that have harmed our troops. And I'd like to repeat: I do not know whether or not the Qods Force was ordered from the top echelons of Government. But my point is, what's worse: them ordering it and it happening or them not ordering it and it's happening? And so we will continue to protect our troops.
David, our strategy is comprehensive in order to resolve problems that will affect our own peace and the peace in the world. And the biggest problem I see is the Iranians' desire to have a nuclear weapon. And as you know, we've been dealing with this issue ever since you've been covering me and pretty much ever since I've been the President. And we've made it very clear to the Iranians that if they would like to have a dialog with the United States, there needs to be a verifiable suspension of their program. I would hope that they would do that. I would like to be at the—have been given a chance for us to explain that we have no desire to harm the Iranian people.
But my focus is on making sure that this weapon is dealt with—the program is dealt with in a constructive, peaceful way. And we'll continue to work toward achieving our common objectives with other nations in the world in a peaceful way.
Sheryl [Sheryl Stolberg, New York Times].
Q. ——using faulty intelligence to provoke Iran?
The President. Well, no, I heard your question. And I told you, I was confident that the Qods Force, a part of the Iranian Government, was providing weaponry into Iraq. And to say it is provoking Iran is just a wrong way to characterize the Commander in Chief's decision to do what is necessary to protect our soldiers in harm's way. And I will continue to do so.
Bret [Bret Baier, FOX News].
Six-Party Talks
Q. Mr. President, on the North Korea deal, the former U.N. Ambassador, John Bolton, yesterday said, quote, ""It's a bad, disappointing deal, and the best thing you can say about it is that it will probably fall apart."" This is from a man you repeatedly praised for his judgment and leadership at the United Nations. His main criticism is that the financial pressure led North Korea back to the table, and now it's being released. How do you respond to that?
The President. I strongly disagree, strongly disagree with his assessment. I have told the American people, like the Iranian issue, I wanted to solve the North Korean issue peacefully, and that the President has an obligation to try all diplomatic means necessary to do so. I changed the dynamic on the North Korean issue by convincing other people to be at the table with us, on the theory that the best diplomacy is diplomacy in which there is more than one voice—that has got an equity in the issue— speaking.
And so we had a breakthrough as a result of other voices than the United States saying to the North Koreans, ""We don't support your nuclear weapons program, and we urge you to get rid of it in a verifiable way."" Perhaps the most significant voice that had been added to the table was China. But the South Korean voice was vital, as was the Japanese and Russian voices as well. So the assessment made by some that this is not a good deal is just flat wrong.
Now, those who say the North Koreans have got to prove themselves by actually following through in the deal are right— and I'm one. This is a good first step. It will be a great deal for the North Korean people if their Government follows through with the agreement, which, by the way, started in September of 2005. The agreement that we announced the other day was a continuation of the initial agreement in September of 2005. And for those who say that, well, this is an interesting moment, and now it's up to the North Koreans to do that which they say they will do, I couldn't agree more with you.
And the first phase is to shut down and seal their facility, their main weapons manufacturing facility, and then disclose their programs. And for that, they'll receive some help from the South Koreans, the equivalent of 50,000 tons of fuel.
And the second phase is to disable and abandon their facilities. In other words, this is a phased approach that will enable all of us to say to our respective populations, we're watching carefully and that there's a opportunity for the North Koreans to prove that this program can work.
If they do the second phase, there is a—there will be about the equivalent of a million tons—minus the 50,000 tons— available of food, economic assistance, and fuel. I am particularly interested in helping get food to the North Korean people. Now, that's not going to happen until there's some verifiable measures that have been taken.
The financial measures that you're speaking about are really a separate item, because it has everything to do with—it's a banking issue that our Treasury Department is analyzing to determine whether or not funds were illicitly moved through the bank.
Let's see, yes, sir.
Iran/War in Iraq
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to follow up on Iran one more time. You saying today that you do not know if senior members of the Iranian Government are, in fact, behind these explosives—that contradicts what U.S. officials said in Baghdad on Sunday. They said the highest levels of the Iranian Government were behind this. It also—it seems to square with what General Pace has been saying, but contradicts with what your own Press Secretary said yesterday.
The President. Can I—let me explain it to you, Ed [Ed Henry, Cable News Network], I can't say it more plainly: There are weapons in Iraq that are harming U.S. troops because of the Qods Force. And as you know, I hope, that the Qods Force is a part of the Iranian Government. Whether Ahmadi-nejad ordered the Qods Force to do this, I don't think we know. But we do know that they're there, and I intend to do something about it. And I've asked our commanders to do something about it. And we're going to protect our troops.
Q. But given some of those contradictions, Mr. President——
The President. There's no contradiction that the weapons are there and they were provided by the Qods Force, Ed.
Q. What assurances can you give the American people that the intelligence this time will be accurate?
The President. Ed, we know they're there; we know they're provided by the Qods Force; we know the Qods Force is a part of the Iranian Government. I don't think we know who picked up the phone and said to the Qods Force, ""Go do this,"" but we know it's a vital part of the Iranian Government.
What matters is, is that we're responding. The idea that somehow we're manufacturing the idea that the Iranians are providing IEDs is preposterous, Ed. My job is to protect our troops. And when we find devices that are in that country that are hurting our troops, we're going to do something about it, pure and simple.
Now David says, ""Does this mean you're trying to have a pretext for war?"" No, it means I'm trying to protect our troops; that's what that means. And that's what the family members of our soldiers expect the Commander in Chief and those responsible for our troops on the ground. And we'll continue do so.
Yes, ma'am. You're not a ""ma'am."" Martha [Martha Raddatz, ABC News].
Situation in Iraq
Q. Mr. President, do you agree with the National Intelligence Estimate that we are now in a civil war in Iraq? And also, you talk about victory, that you have to have victory in Iraq; it would be catastrophic if we didn't. You said again today that the enemy would come here, and yet you say it's not an open-ended commitment. How do you square those things?
The President. You know, victory in Iraq is not going to be like victory in World War II. And it's one of the challenges I have, to explain to the American people what Iraq will look like in a situation that will enable us to say, we have accomplished our mission.
First, the—Iraq will be a society in which there is relative peace. I say ""relative peace"" because if it's, like, zero car bombings, it never will happen that way. It's like—I mean, the fundamental question is, can we help this Government have the security force level necessary to make sure that the ethnic cleansing that was taking place in certain neighborhoods has stopped?
Look, there's criminality in Iraq as well as the ethnic violence. And we've got to help the Iraqis have a police force that deals with criminals. There is an Al Qaida presence in Iraq, as you know. I believe some of the spectacular bombings have been caused by Al Qaida. As a matter of fact, Zarqawi—the terrorist Zarqawi, who is not an Iraqi—made it very clear that he intended to use violence to spur sectarian—car bombings and spectacular violence—to spur sectarian violence. And he did a good job of it.
And so there—and then there's this disaffected Sunnis, people who believe that they should still be in power in spite of the fact that the Shi'a are the majority of the country. And they're willing to use violence to try to create enough chaos so they get back in power.
The reason I described that is that no matter what you call it, it's a complex situation, and it needed to be dealt with inside of Iraq. We've got people who say ""civil war""; we've got people on the ground who don't believe it's a civil war. But nevertheless, it is—it was dangerous enough that I had to make a decision to try to stop it, so that a government that is bound by a constitution, where the country feels relatively secure as a result of a security force that is evenhanded in its application of security; a place where the vast resources of the country—this is a relatively wealthy country, in that they've got a lot of hydrocarbons—is shared equally amongst people; that there is a federalism that evolves under the Constitution, where the local Provinces have got authority as well; and where people who may have made a political decision in the past and yet weren't criminals can participate in the life of the country; and is an ally in the war on terror—in other words, that there is a bulwark for moderation as opposed to a safe haven for extremism. And that's what I would view as successful.
Q. Do you believe it's a civil war, sir?
The President. I can only tell you what people on the ground, whose judgment— it's hard for me, living in this beautiful White House, to give you an assessment— firsthand assessment. I haven't been there. You have; I haven't. But I do talk to people who are and people whose judgment I trust, and they would not qualify it as that. There are others who think it is. It is, however, a dangerous situation, thereby requiring action on my part.
Listen, I considered several options: One, doing nothing—and that if you don't believe the situation was acceptable, then you should do something. And I didn't believe the situation was acceptable.
Secondly, I could have listened to the advice of some and pulled back and hoped for the best. I felt that would be extraordinarily dangerous for this young democracy, that the violence in Baghdad could escalate mightily and then spill out across the country, creating chaos, vacuums into which extremism would flow. Or make the decision I made, which is to reinforce the troops that were on the ground, to help this Iraqi Government and security force do what they're supposed to do.
Sir, you dropped?
Q. Bad hands. [Laughter]
The President. Yes.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Modern guy, you know— you got the Blackberry and everything there.
Military Families/U.S. Armed Forces
Q. I'd like to ask you about troop morale.
The President. Yes.
Q. As you know, a growing number of troops are on their second, third, or fourth tour in Iraq. There have been a growing number of reports about declining morale among fighting men. I spoke personally to an infantry commander—tough guy, patriot—who says more and more of the troops are asking, questioning what they're doing here. Does this come as a surprise to you? Are you aware of this? Is it a minority opinion? Is it a growing opinion? And does it concern you?
The President. I am—what I hear from commanders is that the place where there is concern is with the family members, that our troops, who have volunteered to serve the country, are willing to go into combat multiple times, but that the concern is with the people on the homefront. And I can understand that. And I—and that's one reason I go out of my way to constantly thank the family members. You know, I'm asking—you're obviously talking to certain people—or a person. I'm talking to our commanders. Their job is to tell me what— the situation on the ground. And I have— I know there's concern about the home-front. I haven't heard deep concern about the morale of the troops in Iraq.
Q. Would a commander tell you that? Would he—[inaudible]—because you're the President of the United States?
The President. Yes, they'd tell me that. Sure, absolutely. Just like they told me that they thought they needed extra troops to do the job. Sure.
Listen, I want our troops out of there as quickly as possible. But I also want to make sure that we get the job done, and I made the decision I made in order to do so.
Jim [Jim Gerstenzang, Los Angeles Times].
Iran/Diplomacy
Q. You spoke positively about the role of diplomacy in North Korea, and you obviously gave it a long time to work. Where does diplomacy fit in, in terms of Iran, and do we have any leverage if we try diplomacy there?
The President. Well, I guess you could call getting the EU-3, China, and Russia on the same page on a Chapter VII resolution successful diplomacy. I thought that was diplomacy. And it took a long time to get there. I mean, we're working hard to send a concerted message to the Iranians, a focused, unified message that the world believes you should not have a nuclear program. And so this is a multilateral approach to try to get the Government to alter its course on a nuclear weapons program.
I can't think of any more robust diplomacy than to have more than one party at the table talking to the Iranians. And we did so through the United Nations at this case. If they want us at the table, we're more than willing to come, but there must be a verifiable suspension of this wea","pons program that is causing such grave concern.
We'll continue to work with other nations. Matter of fact, I believe that it is easier for the United States to achieve certain diplomatic objectives when we work with other nations, which is precisely why we adopted the strategy we did in dealing with the Iranians.
Sheryl.
U.S. Congress/Iraq
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, it seems pretty clear where this Iraq vote in the House is headed. Your Press Secretary has said repeatedly that Members of Congress ought to watch what they say and be concerned about the message that they're sending to our enemy. I'm wondering, do you believe that a vote of disapproval of your policy emboldens the enemy? Does it undermine your ability to carry out your policies there? And also, what are you doing to persuade the Democratic leadership in Congress not to restrict your ability to spend money in Iraq?
The President. Yes, thanks. A couple of points: One, that I understand the Congress is going to express their opinion, and it's very clear where the Democrats are, and some Republicans; I know that. They didn't like the decision I made. And by the way, that doesn't mean that I think that they're not good, honorable citizens of the country—just have a different opinion. I considered some of their opinions and felt like it would not lead to a country that could govern itself, sustain itself, and be an ally in the war on terror—one.
Secondly, my hope, however, is that this nonbinding resolution doesn't try to turn into a binding policy that prevents our troops from doing that which I have asked them to do. That's why I keep reminding people, on the one hand, you vote for David Petraeus in a unanimous way, and then the other hand, you say that you're not going to fund the strategy that he thought was necessary to do his job, a strategy he testified to in front of the Senate. I'm going to make it very clear to the Members of Congress, starting now, that they need to fund our troops, and they need to make sure we have the flexibility necessary to get the job done.
Secondly, I find it interesting that there is a declaration about a plan that they have not given a chance to work. Again, I understand; I understand. The other part of your question?
Q. It emboldens the enemy——
The President. Oh, yes. The only thing I can tell you is that when I speak, I'm very conscious about the audiences that are listening to my words. The first audience obviously is the American people. My second audience would be the troops and their families. That's why I appreciate the question about whether or not—about the troop morale; it gave me a chance to talk to the families and how proud we are of them.
Third, no question, people are watching what happens here in America. The enemy listens to what's happening; the Iraqi people listen to the words, the Iranians. People are wondering; they're wondering about our commitment to this cause. And one reason they wonder is that in a violent society, the people sometimes don't take risks for peace if they're worried about having to choose between different sides, different violent factions. As to whether or not this particular resolution is going to impact enemy thought, I can't tell you that. But I can tell you that people are watching the debate.
I do believe that the decision I made surprised people in the Middle East. And I think it's going to be very important, however, that the Iraqi Government understand that this decision was not an open-ended commitment, that we expect Prime Minister Maliki to continue to make the hard decisions he's making.
Unlike some here, I'm a little more tolerant of a person who has been only in government for 7 months and hasn't had a lot of—and by the way, a Government that hasn't had a lot of experience with democracy. And on the other hand, it's important for him to know, and I believe he does know, that the American people want to see some action and some positive results. And listen, I share that same desire.
The faster that the Maliki Government steps up security in Baghdad, the more quickly we can get to what Baker-Hamilton recommended, and that is embedding and training over the rise in presence, protection of the territorial integrity of Iraq, and a strong hunt for Al Qaida and terrorists who would try to use that country as safe haven. I thought the Baker-Hamilton made a lot of sense, their recommendations. We just weren't able to get there if the capital was up in flames. And that's why I made the decision I made.
Yes, Peter [Peter Baker, Washington Post].
CIA Employee Identity Leak Investigation
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Sir, we've now learned through sworn testimony that at least three members of your administration, other than Scooter Libby, leaked Valerie Plame's identity to the media. None of these three is known to be under investigation. Without commenting on the Libby trial, then, can you tell us whether you authorized any of these three to do that——
The President. Not going to talk about it.
Q. ——or were they authorized without your permission?
The President. Yes, thanks, Pete. I'm not going to talk about any of it. Thank you.
Q. They're not under investigation, though, sir?
The President. Peter, I'm not going to talk about any of it.
Q. How about pardons, sir? Many people are asking whether you might pardon somebody——
The President. Not going to talk about it, Peter. [Laughter] Would you like to think of another question? Being the kind man that I am, I will recycle you. [Laughter]
John [John McKinnon, Wall Street Journal].
Economic Sanctions/Iran
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Do you like that one— ""recycling"" him? [Laughter]
Q. That took care of one of my questions as well, sir, but——
The President. If that's the case, sit down. Next question. [Laughter]
Q. A lot of our allies in Europe do a lot of business with Iran, so I wonder what your thoughts are about how you further tighten the financial pressure on Iran, in particular, if it also means economic pain for a lot of our allies?
The President. Yes. It's an interesting question. One of the problems—not specifically on this issue, just in general—that— let's put it this way: Money trumps peace, sometimes. In other words, commercial interests are very powerful interests throughout the world. And part of the issue in convincing people to put sanctions on a specific country is to convince them that it's in the world's interest that they forgo their own financial interest.
And, John, that's why sometimes it's tough to get tough economic sanctions on countries. And I'm not making any comment about any particular country, but you touched on a very interesting point.
And so therefore, we're constantly working with nations to convince them that what really matters in the long run is to have the environment so peace can flourish. In the Iranian case, I firmly believe that if they were to have a weapon, it would make it difficult for peace to flourish. And therefore, I'm working with people to make sure that that concern trumps whatever commercial interests may be preventing governments from acting. I make no specific accusation with that statement. It's a broad statement. But it's an accurate assessment of what sometimes can halt multilateral diplomacy from working.
Let's see here. Ann [Ann Compton, ABC Radio].
Iraq/2008 Presidential Election
Q. Thank you. Iraq is not only being debated in Congress, but it's going to be debated in the Presidential election that's coming ahead. Is that debate—is there a chance that that is going to hurt your progress in Iraq? And is it appropriate, at some point, perhaps, for the Government to brief the Presidential candidates so they have a better understanding of what it is you're trying to do?
The President. Thank you for that question. I thought for a minute you were going to try to get me to comment on the Presidential race. And I'd just like to establish some ground rules here with those of you who are stuck following me for the next little less than 2 years: I will resist all temptation to become the pundit in chief and commenting upon every twist and turn of the Presidential campaign. As much as I like politics and am intrigued by the race— it's very similar to how I deftly handled Baker's question—I won't comment.
Secondly, I remember a Member of Congress came to me before one of my speeches—I think it was the Iraq speech as opposed to the State of the Union speech—and said, ""You'd better be eloquent in order to convince the American people to support this plan."" He didn't say ""articulate""; he said ""eloquent."" [Laughter] And my point to the person was, what really matters is what happens on the ground. I can talk all day long. But what really matters to the American people is to see progress—which leads to your point, Martha, and that is, progress can best be measured by whether or not the people can see noticeable changes of security inside the capital city. In this case, the Baghdad security plan has got to yield peace in certain mixed neighborhoods, for example.
And so therefore, to the extent that it affects votes, speeches, perceptions, elections, what really is going to matter is what happens ultimately. And that's all I really care to comment about it. You know, it's——
Q. Do you think you could win reelection——
The President. I'm not running. [Laughter] And I know that's going to disappoint some of you. But, anyway, that's pundit in chief-type questions, so I'm not going to answer those. Pundit in chief—trying to get me to be pundit in chief. No.
Let's see here. Hutch [Ron Hutcheson, McClatchy].
Support for Troops in Iraq
Q. Morning.
The President. Yes, thanks.
Q. I think I'd like to follow on Sheryl's question about undermining the troops.
The President. Yes.
Q. Do you have to support the war to support the warrior? I mean, if you're one of those Americans that thinks you've made a terrible mistake, that it's destined to end badly, what do you do? If they speak out, are they by definition undermining the troops?
The President. No, she actually asked ""the enemy,"" not ""the troops."" But I'll be glad to answer your question. No, I don't think so at all. I think you can be against my decision and support the troops; absolutely. But the proof will be whether or not you provide them the money necessary to do the mission.
I said early in my comment—my answer to Sheryl was that somebody who doesn't agree with my policy is just as patriotic a person as I am. And your question is valid. I mean, can somebody say, ""We disagree with your tactics or strategy, but we support the military""—absolutely, Ron, sure. But what's going to be interesting is if they don't provide the flexibility and support for our troops that are there to enforce the strategy that David Petraeus, the general on the ground, thinks is necessary to accomplish the mission.
Michael [Michael Allen, Politico]. Michael, who do you work for? [Laughter]
Bipartisanship in Congress/Legislative Agenda
Q. Mr. President, I work for politico.com.
The President. Pardon me? Politico.com?
Q. Yes, sir. Today. [Laughter]
The President. Do you want a moment to explain to the American people exactly what—[laughter].
Q. Mr. President, thank you for the question. [Laughter]
The President. Quit being so evasive. [Laughter]
Q. You should read it.
The President. Is it good? You like it?
Q. David Gregory endorsed——
The President. David Gregory likes it. I can see the making of a testimonial. [Laughter] Anyway, go ahead, please.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You spoke hopefully about your ability to work with Democrats, their willingness to work with you in this new world. I wonder how that's going so far, what you've learned about how they think, and does the current debate constitute grounds for divorce?
The President. Interesting way to put it. First of all, I think they're patriotic people who care about our country—back to Hutch's penetrating comment—or question. I do. I was very appreciative of the reception I got at the State of the Union. It was a cordial, respectful reception that gave me a chance to talk about what I believe. I was also very grateful for the reception I received at the Democratic retreat that I went to there in Virginia.
You know, my impression of the meeting there was that we share a lot in common. We're people that actually put filing papers down and ran for office; we're willing to put our families through the grind of politics; we wanted to serve our country, that we care deeply about what takes place in Washington, America, and the world.
My hope is, is that we can get positive pieces of legislation passed, because I think there's a lot of expectation that the difference of opinion on Iraq would make it impossible for us to work on other areas. I disagree with that assessment. And I hope I'm right, and the best way to determine whether I'm right is, will I be able to sign legislation that we have been able to work on?
One such piece of policy is a balanced budget. There seems to be agreement that we should have a balanced budget. I laid out one way forward to achieve that balance, and it shows that we can balance the budget without raising taxes and do so in a 5-year horizon. And I would like to work with the Democrat leadership as well as obviously my Republican folks, to get it done.
Secondly, an interesting opportunity is immigration. As you know, I strongly believe that we need to enforce our borders and that—and have taken steps to do so. But I also believe that in order to enforce the borders, we need a temporary-worker program so that people don't try to sneak in the country to work, that they can come in an orderly fashion, and take the pressure off the Border Patrol agents that we've got out there, so that the Border Patrol agents don't focus on workers that are doing jobs Americans aren't doing but are focusing on terrorists and criminal elements, gun runners, to keep the country—both our countries safe—Mexico and the United States safe.
I also know that we need to deal with the people who are here—the 12 million people who are here illegally. I have said multiple times that we can't kick them out of our country. It doesn't make any sense to me to try to do that, and I don't think— maybe some feel that way, but I don't feel that way. But I also don't believe we should give them automatic amnesty—automatic citizenship, which I view as amnesty. And we look forward to working with Democrats and Republicans to have a comprehensive immigration plan.
Energy is an opportunity for us to work together. We've done a lot of work in the past on promoting alternative sources of energy. America has done more than any nation in the world in promoting alternatives and renewables, all aiming to make sure our economy grows, that we have energy independence, and that we're good stewards of the environment. And I look forward to working with the Democrats on the energy independence initiative I laid out.
One such initiative was the mandatory fuel standards that relies upon alternative fuel to power automobiles. Ethanol is the first and most notable place where we can start, but we also need to spend monies to develop technologies that will enable us to make energy out of products other than corn, switchgrass or wood chips, for example.
The problem with relying only on corn is that—by the way, when your demand for corn stays high, the price tends to go up, and your hog farmer gets disgruntled with the alternative energy plan. And therefore, what's going to matter is that new technologies come on line as quickly as possible to take the pressure off of corn ethanol—or corn, as a result of being used in ethanol, and we can work with Congress to do that. That's an area we can work.
Health care: I got a letter the other day from a group of Republican and Democrat Senators talking about the desire to work on health care. And they liked some of my ideas. But my only point is, is that there's an opportunity for us to work together to help the uninsured have private insurance so they can be—so they can get good health care. And there's an opportunity to work together there.
The Governors are coming into town soon. And I'm going to have Secretary Leavitt describe to them the affordable grants program that is a part of our comprehensive approach, including rewriting the Tax Code.
Finally, No Child Left Behind needs to be reauthorized. I fully understand that if you read your newspaper articles—which I do, sometimes—and listen carefully, you'll hear voices in both parties saying they don't like No Child Left Behind—it's too much testing, or we don't want to be held to account, or whatever they say. The bill is working. It makes a lot of sense.
There's an income gap in America that I talked about when I went to Wall Street. And what's clear to me is that our kids have got to have education so that in this global economy, the jobs of the 21st century stay here at home. And it starts with good education. And therefore, I will argue vociferously that No Child Left Behind Act needs to be reauthorized—it's working; it's an important piece of legislation—and will reach out to Democrat Members, as well as Republican Members, to get this bill reauthorized.
And so there's a lot of areas, Mike. I'd say it's a little early in the process. This is a 2-year term. We've got time to work together to get important pieces of legislation done. And I like the start. As a matter of fact, this afternoon I've got members of both parties, both Chambers coming down to visit about how we can continue to work together to get some legislation done.
As I told the Democrats, and as the Democrats have made clear to me in my visits, that neither of us are going to abandon our principles, that I don't expect them to change their principles, and they shouldn't expect me to. But there's ways for us to work together to achieve legislative successes for the common good. That's what the American people want to see, and that's what I believe we can do. Is it going to take work? Yes, it's going to take work, but it's okay. That's why you pay us all this money.
Richard [Richard Wolffe, Newsweek].
Iran
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Last question, then I've got to go have lunch with Bob Gates, Secretary of the Defense.
What are you looking at there? Checking the time? For the viewer out there—you're getting a big—timekeeper and everything. [Laughter]
Q. I don't mean to interrupt. [Laughter]
The President. I just thought he was looking at the watch because he was getting bored. I wasn't sure, you know?
Q. I'm never bored.
The President. Remember the debates?
Q. Yes.
The President. Yes. [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President, Republican and Democratic Presidents before you sat down for face-to-face talks with the Soviet Union, a nation that was clearly hostile, tyrannical, and had a huge nuclear arsenal. Why do you think that face-to-face talks between yourself and the leadership of Iran would be any more compromising for you?
The President. Richard, if I thought we could achieve success, I would sit down, but I don't think we can achieve success right now. And therefore, we'll want to work with other nations. I think that we're more likely to achieve our goals when others are involved as well. I really don't want to put the situation—listen, let me put it this way: I want to make sure that in the Iranian issue that the whole world stays engaged, because I believe that's a more effective way of convincing the Iranians that—to give up their nuclear weapons ambitions. That's why.
Look, I know this is a world in which— and I'm not suggesting you're this way— but this is a world in which people say, ""Meet, sit down and meet."" And my answer is, ""If it yields results, that's what I'm interested in."" And so I believe the strategy that—and by the way, I remember this during the North Korean issue, debate. People kept saying, ""Well, all you've got to do is sit down with the guy."" And I kept saying, ""Well, I think it's going to be more effective if we have other people at the table with us saying the same thing, so that just in case he decides not to honor the agreement, there will be other people saying the same thing I'll say, which is, ‘You said one thing; you did another.""' It will make it easier for us to send that message that the world, pretty well united in solving this problem peacefully.
And so that's why I made the decision I made. It sounds tempting for somebody to say, ""All you've got to do is sit down with the people."" I'm in a little different position in that I'm trying to achieve certain objectives. And we are making progress on the Iranian issue. If you step back to early on in the process, there was doubt as to whether or not the world would come together, sometimes because of the reason John mentioned, in other words, the conflicting interests. And I believe we are making good progress toward solving this issue peacefully.
And we'll continue to try to solve the issue peacefully. It's an important issue whether or not Iran ends up with a nuclear weapon. It's one of these issues that people are going to look back and say: ""You know, how come they couldn't see the impending danger? What happened to them?"" You've heard me say that often about what would happen if we don't—if we were to abandon our efforts in the Middle East for stability and peace through forms of government that are more likely to defeat an extremist ideology that would like to be able to prevail.
And it's a—at any rate, that's why I made the decision I made. Presidents have to weigh different options all the time. Look, I fully understand there are some who are—don't agree with every decision I make. I hope the American people understand I make those decisions because I believe it's going to yield the peace that we all want.
Listen, thank you for your time. Enjoyed it very much."

There's more journalists here than at the Oscar—[laughter]—although the artists aren't quite as good looking as the ones that get Oscars.
Your Excellency, Mr. George Bush, President of the United States of America; the members of the North American and Brazilian delegations; Governor of Sao Paulo, Jose Serra; our dear president of Petrobras, Mr. Gabrielli; ministers; journalists; my friends; ladies and gentlemen:
This second visit by President Bush to Brazil in little more than 1 year is another step in intensifying dialog between our Governments and our countries. This is a dialog which began even before I took office, when President Bush received me in a visit in December 2002 at the White House. During the frequent meetings and phone calls we have had since then, our relations have always been characterized by extreme frankness, mutual respect, and a constructive spirit.
Our societies are multiethnic. Many cultures and ideas live together within them. They were founded on the principles of pluralism, tolerance, and respect for diversity. The fact that our Governments respect each other, mutually, explains the excellent moment that relations between Brazil and the United States are going through. It also reveals the great potential for cooperation between our countries, if we are able to continue building common objectives.
This has been the basis of the conversations we held today, when we went over our broad bilateral agenda and evaluated how we could best work on regional and multilateral issues. The relationship between Brazil and the U.S. historically has gone beyond individual governments at the head of either of our countries. One proof of this is the broad range of relations amongst business leaders, representatives of civil society, and the citizens of our two countries.
The United States are our largest individual trade partner and the largest investor in Brazil. During my first mandates in Government, trade between our countries increased over 50 percent; U.S. investments in Brazil doubled over the past decade. Brazilian companies are more and more active inside the U.S. economy. They are, alongside the major Brazilian community that lives there, are contributing to generate jobs and income in that country.
Ladies and gentlemen, Brazil is proud of having contributed to the decision by the U.S. Government to increase the share of biofuels in its energy mix. I recall the enthusiasm with which President Bush was first exposed in the meeting we had in Brasilia in 2005 to Brazil's success story in terms of biofuel.
Here in Brazil, we have an extremely successful program, considered a model, which came out of the investment of over 30 years in research and development. It's a program which brings together respect for the environment with the preservation and intensification of the food security of our society. It's a program which has a major social impact because of its capacity to generate jobs, to strengthen family farming, and to distribute income.
This is a field where our two countries can cooperate. The memorandum of understanding on biofuels, which our ministers signed today, is a decisive step in that direction. Bringing together their efforts, the U.S. and Brazil can further push the democratization of energy and bring biofuels to all.
One of the most complex tasks that we face will be to assure access to major consuming centers. Brazil hopes that the ethanol market will be benefited by free trade, free of protectionism. That is the only way that the fuel of the future will be able to promote sustainable development. It also benefit poor and developing countries, by making trade a factor of prosperity for all. This will be a challenge about which I spoke at length with President Bush. We need to eliminate imbalances that still constrain world trade and that aggravate the asymmetries of today's world.
I expressed to the President my feeling that we are closer than ever to a successful conclusion of the negotiations of the Doha round. All should come out winning, with an ambitious and balanced agreement, especially the poorest countries. More opportunities for growth and for development would be created in the poorest regions of the world. International trade in agriculture would increase, thereby reducing poverty, generating jobs and income in the least favored countries and regions.
That is why I repeated to President Bush my willingness to participate in a meeting in any part of the world to bringing together leaders if this can help us overcome the final difficulties between us and a truly historic agreement.
My dear Mr. President, your visit to Brazil coincides with an exceptional moment that our continent is going through, particularly South America. The dictatorships which our region suffered from for two decades are no more than a painful memory of the past. All South American Governments have arisen from free elections with broad, popular participation. All of them are working in projects for growth with income distribution, capable of putting an end to terrible social inequalities that we have inherited and which has been aggravated by macroeconomic adventures in the past. We are all finally involved in a project for South American integration.
The countries in our region have associated their destiny with that of the MERCOSUR and that of the South American Community of Nations. We know that integration is the best pathway to strengthen democracy and to achieve regional prosperity. It creates wealth and promotes development. It guarantees a more sovereign presence of our region in the world. Our integration is taking place amongst independent nations, where diversity and tolerance are also factors of strength.
We respect the political and economic options of each country. This has allowed us to make notable advances: expanding trade, carrying out infrastructure works, strengthening our energy security, the well-being of our societies, and bringing closer together peoples that will be able to move down their own roads. Integration also opens the way for investments from outside the region in the area of infrastructure and will have a multiplying effect on our economies, dynamizing all forms of exchange.
Mr. President, redemocratization and the conquering of political freedom were not enough to keep millions of Brazilians and Latin Americans out of a situation of extreme poverty. That is why all governments in our region have implemented programs to develop our countries and to fight social exclusion. We, the Presidents, must think about the lives of those people who suffer the most and who, in addition to having democracy to elect their rulers, also have the right to health, to education, to housing, to public safety, to bring up their children as citizens. We all know that political democracy prospers when we have economic and social development, when we eradicate poverty, when we fight exclusion and social inequities.
That is why, my dear President Bush, your visit to Brazil—second visit in such a short time—opens the possibility for the U.S. and Brazilian peoples, and I believe all Latin American peoples, to have the prospect that we are not far away from being able to build a new standard of relations amongst nations, to be able to discuss freely and sovereignly about how rich countries can help poorer countries to develop, and more important than all of that, to assure that democracy will be the reason why the benefits of wealth, the building of wealth itself, and the social benefits that the people need, can fully justify the hard fight to win democracy in our continent.
President Bush, I would like to conclude by saying to you that Brazil is aware of the meaning of the integration of South America; Brazil is aware of the meaning of the integration of Latin America, just as Brazil is aware of the meaning coming closer—of Brazil coming closer to Africa, and also the U.S. coming closer to Africa. I think the U.S. and Brazil, working together, could build some—carry out some projects that could have the meaning for poorer countries to be able to provide certainty that people would not see in richer countries, just exploiters, but to see richer countries in the world as something else.
And that is why the Doha round is important. That's why the WTO agreement is important. And I see that your negotiating minister is here, the USTR is here; my minister is here, and I think that we should give them one single order: Come to an agreement as soon as possible. Because if the U.S. and Brazil come to an understanding, it's easier for us to convince those who are still not participating in that agreement.
I want to thank you and say that this relation between Brazil and the U.S., which is a longstanding relation consecrated by decades of time, will continue to be strengthened to the extent that we respect each other, to the extent that each respects the sovereign political decision of each state, and to the extent that we are able to build together projects that can help other countries to pull themselves out of the situation of poverty they're in.
Thank you very much, President Bush, for your visit to Brazil.
President Bush. I was really looking forward to coming back and visiting with you because every time we have a conversation about mutual concerns and opportunities, it is a constructive and positive dialog.
I respect President Lula. Obviously, the people of Brazil respect him. After all, you won by a landslide election, and I congratulate you for your election, yet was not— had not been back to your country since the elections. I think it's great to be able to say a good friend won reelection because it confirms the fact that democracy is alive and well in Brazil. And Brazil serves as such a great example for other democracies about what is possible and what's important.
Thanks very much for the trip to the biofuels plant today. I think it's interesting, as I said there at the plant, that we spent a lot of time and a lot of conversations on how we can work together to promote alternative sources of energy. It's in the interests of the United States that we promote alternative sources of energy. And Brazil has showed what's possible.
And so, Mr. President, I appreciate very much your leadership on this issue. I talked to my country about the need to reduce our gasoline usage by 20 percent over 10 years, that we will have 35 billion gallons of alternative fuels by the year 2017. I think it's an achievable goal. You have shown what is possible. I look forward to sharing research between our countries. I look forward to continuing to explore opportunities.
I share your concerns about the people in democracy not receiving the benefits of democracy. I think you're very wise to recognize that democracy is only as strong as the people feel that the society benefits them. Part of the message on my trip to South America—and eventually Guatemala as well as Mexico—is to say that the American people care deeply about social justice, that we believe in education and health, that we believe in supporting programs that help lift people out of their current conditions, and we want to help.
Thank you very much for our strong discussion on trade. It turns out America and Brazil have—are in the center of the WTO debate; that if we're despondent on the trade talks, a lot of the world will be despondent on the trade talks; that if we're unable to work together on the WTO talks, the world can't work together on the WTO talks. And that's why our conversation was vital, because success of the Doha round for the WTO is necessary for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is the most effective antipoverty program is trade.
And so I commit to you the same thing that you have just committed, and that is, we will work together. We will lock our trade ministers in a room—[laughter]—all aimed at advancing this important round.
I share your optimism about what can get done, and it's going to take a lot of work. I caution other countries, though, that if the United States and Brazil agree, that does not let them off the hook in terms of making the concessions necessary so that everybody is a winner in these trade negotiations.
One thing that I strongly believe in is that I think America needs to be more open to students coming to our country. And I talk to Secretary Rice about that a lot, and I hope a lot of Brazilian students are coming to the United States of America. I hope—I think you'll find it to be a fantastic opportunity to study and learn. And it's in our interests that we have people come and see what we're like, to have people come and see the compassion of the American people.
We talked about foreign policy in our discussions. We spent time on Central America, and one of the messages we will send to our Central American friends is that one way to help develop your countries is for you to adopt ethanol and biodiesel industries.
We talked about Haiti, and I congratulate the President for his strong leadership in accepting the responsibilities for helping Haiti. Brazil has been a strong leader in helping provide stabilization and providing troops. I know it's a strain, Mr. President, but you made a tough choice, and it's a humanitarian choice, and it's a decent choice. And the people of Brazil ought to be proud of your leadership on this important issue.
We talked about Africa. The President shares deep concerns about Africa, as do I. We talked about how we can work together on specific projects aimed at helping people. And so our foreign ministries will talk about specific programs—a Brazilian-American joint venture to help eliminate poverty and lift people's lives up.
I thank you for your leadership. People don't understand this, probably, but I spent a lot of time on world affairs, and the President of this country is highly respected around the world. People listen to him. He speaks clearly, but he speaks with a set of values that are noble.
And so, Mr. President, I'm so glad you're here—I mean, so glad I am here. I'm looking forward to welcoming you to the United States later on this month at Camp David, to be able to continue our dialog and our discussion about how we can work together for the common good.
Thank you.
President Lula da Silva. Thank you very much. As we agreed earlier, we will have two questions from Brazilian journalists and two from U.S. journalists. I'll open the floor for the first question from—[inaudible]— from the Brazilian Television Record Station.
Trade
Q. How could we believe that these possibilities, these commitments that you're taking on to negotiate opening up for the Doha round will be possible, since you have a very recent experience in negotiating FTAA, which did not work out? So what's the difference now in trade negotiations? Will you be trying to speak the same language, despite the difference between Portuguese and English, but try to speak the same language to the rest of the world that these two countries are willing to negotiate? Why is this negotiation at this time different? And perhaps your meeting in Washington will be another chance to set a deadline for the negotiations. Maybe by the end of this month, you can have a commitment.
President Bush. First, I think deadlines are a little dangerous when two countries set them, and we're dealing with a lot of other countries. Remember, we can agree, but if other major trading partners don't agree, then all of a sudden, we have set ourselves up for failure. I'm an optimist that we can get it done. Therefore, I think we need to be careful about creating the conditions that will—for the world to say, ""Oh look, they failed.""
Since we discussed the FTAA—and the United States has entered into a series of agreements, as have Brazil—in other words, there's a lot of bilateral and regional trade agreements going on. And so just because we had difficulty getting the FTAA done, should not discourage one from trying to do something globally. I mean, after all, there's been a lot of successes on the trade front, just not on that particular trade front.
And no question it was hard on the FTAA, and no question it's going to be hard on Doha. But the thing that's important about Doha is that it is—it really is an opportunity to—for the world to get together to help eradicate world poverty. And there's a compelling reason to keep trying.
And so I'm not the least bit discouraged by past failures, nor am I overly optimistic because we've had a lot of successes in trade agreements. I am realistic in knowing that it's hard work, but it's going to require the leadership of Brazil and the United States to stay at it and work hard and see if we can't reach a positive agreement.
President Lula da Silva. Well, my dear friend, Celso, first of all, to achieve an agreement between nations is not a simple thing to do. The complexity of economic problems, as well as political and social problems involved in final decisions, may have extraordinary or disastrous results. I think that we have talked a lot about the Doha round in recent months, and I think that we are moving. We're moving on solid ground to find a chance for the so-called ""G-point"" to come to an agreement. I am convinced of the willingness, as President Bush said, if Brazil and the U.S. find— both find a point of equilibrium where we can make offers to other countries—because the U.S. had an advantage in this negotiation. There's a lot of people that depend on the negotiations from the U.S., but they negotiate in their own name. We, in Brazil, have to negotiate together with the G-20. And the European Union is a group of countries. So you can see that we, in addition to convincing the richer partners, we also have to convince our poorer partners to accept an agreement.
And we accept that challenge; we take it on. We're taking on that challenge because at this point, the success of negotiations is no longer just economic in nature. It's not just a matter of who is going to win or lose economically; the problem now is eminently political. The problem now is whether, as world leaders, we will be competent or not to decide, for better or worse, on the future of millions of human beings that depend on this agreement. I'm convinced that we'll get there.
Second, we cannot compare what we're negotiating now in the Doha round with conversations on FTAA. Of course, you covered my 2002 campaign, and you saw how many speeches I made against the FTAA, back in 2002 when I was first elected. Me and almost all the Presidential candidates running for office in South America were against it, because we believed in the strengthening of MERCOSUR. And we achieved that. We believed, first of all, in strengthening the integration of South America as a first priority. And today, Brazil's largest share of trade is with the rest of Latin America.
This is a demonstration that we took major steps, and that does not mean that we cannot discuss as many bilateral agreements are as possible between Brazil and the U.S., other countries—U.S. and other countries with Brazil. Concretely, when you're negotiating, the numbers get built, and no country wants to be the first one to make an offer. It's just like playing cards; every card you put on the table is spent; you can't take it back. And nobody wants to make the first offer.
Of course, President Bush has his offer up his sleeve; Brazil has one in its vest pocket; the European Union has one stuck someplace. And others don't want to even play. But I'm certain that he and I do have our cards ready, because we want to play. So at some point, we're going to put our cards on the table, and we're going to see whether we'll be capable or not of coming to an agreement.
I want to say that I am convinced that we can make an agreement. It certainly will not be everything that we could do, but will do enough to continue encouraging the rest of the world, especially the poorest countries, that they will have a chance in the 21st century that they did not have in the 20th century.
Central and South America-U.S. Relations
Q. Mr. President Bush, Hugo Chavez of Venezuela has been using his country's vast oil wealth to court a whole new generation of Latin Americans. You pretty much avoided using his name. He certainly used yours a lot, including saying earlier today, ""Go home, gringo."" Do you think a visit to Latin America and agreements like the one you forged today will help counter his influence or just give him more ammunition?
And to President Lula da Silva, were you able to persuade President Bush to help you on getting our Congress to lower the sugar ethanol tariffs?
President Bush. I'll answer that one for him; he can answer it too. It's not going to happen. The law doesn't end until 2009; then the Congress will accept it—will look at it when the law ends.
You may want to expand on that answer.
As to my trip, I bring the good will of the United States to South America and Central America. That's why I'm here. I don't think America gets enough credit for trying to help improve people's lives. And so my trip is to explain, as clearly as I can, that our Nation is generous and compassionate; that when we see poverty, we care; that when we see illiteracy, we want to do something about it; that when we find there to be a deficiency in health care, we'll help to the extent we can.
I'm sure most people here in South America don't understand the United States has doubled our bilateral aid to countries in Central and South America since I've been the President. It's gone from 800 [$800 million] * to 1.6 billion last year. And I say that not to just brag about dollars, but it's a starting point for people to understand this Nation is committed to this prospect. A prosperous neighborhood is in the interest of the United States; a peaceful neighborhood is in our interests.
And so we fully understand that if there's illiteracy, it will affect our country eventually. Plus, the American people have got a great compassion for human rights and human dignity. I'm going to go see some programs here after this press conference, all aimed at lifting the lives of citizens, all aimed at focusing on individuals and how best can they be helped.
There is a lot of investment in the region, as the President noted. Oh, for some, that's just a fancy word, but for others who benefit from the investment through jobs, it's a central part of their life. And so my trip down here is to remind our country that South America and Latin America are good places to invest, particularly in countries that adhere to rule of law and are transparent and believe in the fundamentals of freedom.
And so I'm reminding people that which is pretty evident, that a lot of people know that there are direct ties between our countries. There's a lot of remittances from the United States back to the region. Why? Because there are people working for a living in our country that are sending money home to support their families. So this trip is to remind people of the ties that bind us and the importance of this region for the future of the United States. And I'm real glad to be here, and I appreciate the hospitality.
Get another question moving.
U.S. Foreign Policy/Trade
Q. [Inaudible] My question is for President Bush, is whether you agree that in recent years, the U.S. really had its back turned to Latin America? And if so, what could be done to make up for the losses in the past, in the last 2 years of your Presidency? And to ask President Lula, as well, yesterday you criticized U.S. subsidies as nefarious. So if you really decided to put the two ministers in a room to have an agreement, did you receive any signals that it's possible to reduce domestic subsidies in the U.S. to their farmers?
President Bush. Well, I strongly disagree with your description of U.S. foreign policy. That may be what people say, but it's certainly not what the facts bear out. I just told you that our bilateral aid package has doubled.
Again, I fully recognize that money alone is not a sign of compassion or care, but it's money aimed at helping people improve their lives. It's social justice money. Most of the bilateral aid money that we spend goes to education programs, health programs.
I'm going to—when I go to Guatemala, I'm going to go to a—I'm going to go outside the capital and see our military building health clinics. The USS Comfort is coming to the region to provide care for thousands of people who need health care. We train teachers; we train doctors; we train nurses. And so the characterization that our back has been turned is just— it's not borne out by the facts. It may be a perception, but the facts certainly dispel that.
And that's why I've come. I've been in your great country twice in a very quick period of time, all aiming at sending the message that we care about our neighborhood a lot. And relations between our Governments are strong; we have an open relationship; the dialog is friendly. There's not 100-percent agreement on issues, but, nevertheless, issues are brought to the table in a constructive manner. And it's amazing what you can do when it comes to solving problems, if there's a feeling of mutual respect and a priority.
It's easy to kind of dismiss the United States foreign policy in the region, but think about this: There are millions of people living in our country from the region. The United States is a multicultural society. We've got people from all over South and Central America living in the United States—many there legally, many there illegally, which, by the way, argues for a comprehensive immigration reform plan that teaches people with respect and dignity. It's one of the big issues that I put forth to our Congress, to get a comprehensive immigration plan done.
I appreciate your question, and I'm glad to be down here to be able to answer it.
President Lula da Silva. In terms of the question from the U.S. journalist, he asked whether I was capable of convincing President Bush to get the tariffs reduced. If I were able to—if I had that capacity for persuasion that you think I might have, who knows, I might have convinced President Bush to do so many other things that I couldn't even mention here. [Laughter]
This is a process. There's no difference between—in negotiating processes like this and normal negotiations between human beings. There's a time you look a person in the face and say, ""I don't like that guy."" And a few months later, they might be your best friend, and you were wrong when you said that you didn't like them. So I don't think that a country will give up on the things that protect their trade because someone else is asking. It's a process of convincing that has to take place, a lot of talking. And the day will come when that conversation will mature, and then we can find a common denominator that will allow us to come to an agreement.
In terms of the journalist from the O Globlo newspaper, your question, today we have a problem of what's at stake. I learned from my Minister Celso Amorim that if we draw a triangle, we could show you what the difficulties are in the negotiations we have. What do countries want from the European Union? They want it to facilitate access to their agricultural market for poorer countries to export to them, including the U.S. wants to export to them.
What do we want from the U.S.? We want them to reduce subsidies that they pay in their domestic market. And what does the U.S. and the European Union— what do they want from us Brazilians and other countries in the G-20? That we have greater flexibility and access to markets for industrial products and services. That's what's at stake; that's what's in the game.
If we are intelligent enough and competent enough to pull out of our vest pockets the numbers that are still held secret, as top state secrets, then we will find a common ground. Don't ask me what the number is. If I knew, I wouldn't tell you, because if I knew, then I'd establish a paradigm, and he'd say that I should back off a little bit. So that's why these numbers are held back, though—as a soccer player, when they're going to kick a penalty goal, they never say which corner they're going to try to kick into. But things are happening. They're underway. Of course there's pessimists about everything in the world. That's no problem.
And the third thing I would like to say to President Bush, if you'd allow me to say one thing: Over time, I have become more and more convinced—and I've said this to my colleagues in CARICOM and Central America, I've said this to countries in Africa—that we actually do not need to be discussing aid to those countries. What we need to discuss is something that's even more important than aid. We need to build projects together, projects that mean development, and that after some time, we can see the concrete results of the money that's been invested. Because in some countries over the years, aid money doesn't always lead to concrete results because you don't control how it's spent that well.
I'm convinced that in the biofuel programs, if we are mature enough and have the political understanding and can carry out joint projects with other countries with the U.S., involving South Africa, China, India, European countries, and if we fund projects to produce biodiesel and ethanol in poorer countries, and then the richer countries buy biodiesel that's produced there, then we'll see that investments put into those countries have produced results and, even more important, generated jobs. Because nothing gives more citizenry to a man or a women than to know that they have a job, and to take some money home at the end of the month.
I think that's what we could do. And I said to President Bush: ""We could do that for Central America. We could build development projects for poorer countries."" Then after 5, 10 years, we'll be able to see that som","ething was done there that's generating wealth. That, in my opinion, is the real way, the major way that richer countries can aid poorer countries.
Iraq
Q. Mr. President, the Iraqis hold their regional conference tomorrow. What are your expectations for it? And are you now willing to talk directly with Iran and Syria at this meeting?
President Bush. The expectations are that nations in the neighborhood, plus nations of the world, recognize that democracy can lead to peace, and that when 12 million people vote to live in a free society, it's in all our interests to help them realize the blessings of a free society. That's the expectations—in other words, a commitment to helping this young democracy survive and thrive.
Our message to the Syrians and Iranians won't change at that meeting, that I've stated publicly, which is, we expect you to help this young democracy. And we will defend ourselves and the people in Iraq from the—from weapons being shipped in to cause harm; that we will protect ourselves and help the Iraqi people protect themselves against those who would murder the innocent to achieve political objectives.
And it's a positive meeting, Steve [Steve Holland, Reuters], particularly for Prime Minister Maliki and his Government, in that countries will now be coming to a rather formal meeting to express support. And it's positive because I think it's going to be important for the Iraqi people who have been suffering a lot to hear from other countries in the world that say: ""We embrace your courage; we embrace your willingness to take risk for freedom."" And we'll see how it goes, but I'm happy to have supported the Prime Minister's request that this meeting take place.
Mr. President, thanks. Your press conferences are nice. I appreciate the Brazilian press for coming. Glad the American press behaved okay. [Laughter] Be careful, they may spend a lot of time at the bars around here. [Laughter] Yes.
Okay, thanks."
"March 12, 2007",The President's News Conference With President Oscar Berger Perdomo of Guatemala in Guatemala City,George W. Bush,"George W. Bush, The President's News Conference With President Oscar Berger Perdomo of Guatemala in Guatemala City Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/271974",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-oscar-berger-perdomo-guatemala-guatemala,"President Berger. Distinguished members of the media, welcome, and thank you for honoring us with your presence. A very fruitful, interesting, and productive day with President Bush. Today's visit to the Department of Chimaltenango, Iximche, the contact that we were able to have with our people, the cultural legacy that we were able to witness together, and that the special meaning that it is together closer to the Guatemalan people, and hear from them of their history with President Bush and Mrs. Bush, has been very important today.
After that very interesting visit, we met with teams of Presidents Bush and Berger, and evidently, on the table were extremely important topics, particularly as regards Guatemala. And we were able to discuss security and our efforts to fight drug trafficking. In that sense, President Bush expressed his full support for—expressed his support, also, for the Maya Jaguar plan that is already in operation, and has told us that he is going to make a regional proposal to fight drug trafficking, regionally, where he is inviting Mexico and the Central American countries to join the United States in that fight. Part of this strategy seeks to train the security bodies that are in charge of fighting drug trafficking and the intelligence that is going to surround these teams, and then be able to identify these sources in a permanent strategy—and I insist, regional strategy—which I think is key: We should no longer work in isolation; we should work jointly, that is, the countries that face this very serious problem.
Likewise, we talked about the Millennium Challenge Account. And Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told us that Guatemala continues to be among the countries that could be elected. In the coming 2 months, we are going to receive a response. We expect that it might be favorable for Guatemala.
Today President Bush, who is participating in this productive effort, we were able to see how these Guatemalan workers produce the best vegetables in the world and have been able to enter a very important market, particularly the Central American market, the effort of whose integration President Bush is also aware of.
Of course, President Bush's visit brings us closer to the most important and largest economic power and the largest market in the world, with many possibilities, through CAFTA, where we can have—give better access to the U.S. market to Guatemalan produce, where we highlighted snow peas and berries, chili peppers and tomatoes. We had a limitation, and there was—as of a couple of months, we are exporting significant amounts of Guatemalan produce. So we also mentioned support by U.S. Customs to control Guatemalan port and customs services. This gives us a better rating and makes it possible for us to exercise a more efficient trade effort.
We've mentioned to President Bush, and we've invited the United States to become the partner of the Central American Economic Integration Bank—CABEI—one that he favored. And he is well aware of the fact that this bank and it's resources are used to build infrastructure, to promote investment, and to give support to governments as well.
I believe that everyone will probably be waiting to hear from the—about the topic of migrants. This is a topic that we discussed at greater length with President Bush during the trip this morning and during this afternoon's meeting. It is a concern for President Bush; it is a concern for the Guatemalans and the 13 million illegal aliens who are currently living in the United States.
President Bush has confirmed that there are no express instructions to persecute Guatemalan illegal aliens; that is, somebody is acting beyond the scope of the law, he has to be brought before the law. But if— there is no intention to persecute undocumented workers. He has convinced us that the best proposal is the migration law reform. He extensively explained the efforts that the—what the efforts will need to be engaged by the Democratic groups and the Republican groups in the Senate, but that should not be an issue that should be on the agenda next year. That should be taken care of, and he expects that by August, we will have a reform for the immigration act, where a legal status will be considered for those who are already living there and regulations of how to become a legal worker in the United States.
I would like to take this opportunity, President Bush, to thank you for your visit. Guatemala feels honored. We feel highly satisfied and deeply committed with this effort. We have been in the eyes and the minds of the entire world during these couple of hours that we have been sharing with you. And what is most important, I believe that for the people in the highlands of Guatemala today, there was a message of closeness, of rapport with President Bush, and of a hope. Together, we can achieve great things, as Mariano Canu said in Tecpan, where he showed us what he can do with his work team, how he can give added value to the wonderful vegetables of the highlands of Guatemala, to be able to send it to the great U.S. market.
Once again, for President Berger, this has been a wonderful opportunity to have been able to share with Mrs. Bush and President Bush. And for Guatemala, it is a reason for pride. Once again, thank you very much for your visit.
President Bush. Senor Presidente, thank you very much for your warm welcome. I agree with you; it's been a great day for Laura and me. And we really loved traveling with you and Wendy, and it's just a wonderful experience.
I appreciate your kindness on this first official visit to your country. Relations between the United States and Guatemala are stronger than ever. We're friends, and that's important. Our countries are fellow democracies. We're partners in trade. We're allies in the cause of social justice. Today President Berger and I discussed some of the ways that the United States and Guatemala can continue to work together to build a more hopeful future for the people in our respective countries.
Guatemala is a strong and vibrant democracy of more than 12 million people. President Berger understands the importance of building a government that is accountable to all its citizens, and I appreciate that commitment. I appreciate the steps you've taken to increase transparency, to reduce corruption, to modernize the civil service, and to help improve Guatemala's record on human rights. You've got strong leadership, Mr. President.
In September, you elect a new President, who will face the task of building on your successes. The United States and the international community will support the people of Guatemala in holding free and fair elections.
Your President and I both believe that a strong democracy requires security from drug lords and violent criminals. So we spent a lot of time talking about that today. I appreciate the fact that you have renewed the fight against the drug trade, that you've worked to eradicate opium poppy, and you fired hundreds of corrupt police officers. That's what leaders do; you find problems and you address them for the good of the people. We appreciate Guatemala's commitment to this work, and we'll continue to stand with you.
President Berger is working with the United Nations to form an international commission to help investigate and prosecute organized crime in Guatemala, and the United States strongly supports this effort. Our countries are working together to fight transnational gangs. And the President was right: I suggested we think about this issue regionally. You've got to understand that these gangs are able to move throughout Central America and up through Mexico into our own country, and therefore, we've got to think regionally and act regionally.
The first thing we can do is share information so we can help track down gang members, and we can increase communications; we can develop effective ways to protect children from gangs. There's a lot of work to be done, but it first starts with making a sincere commitment to addressing the problem.
Improving education is an important goal for both our nations. We spent a lot of time today talking about education. And the President and First Lady of Guatemala are absolutely committed to extending education's reach beyond just the capital city. And I appreciate that commitment, Mr. President. More than 40 percent of the population of this country is under 15 years old—it's an interesting statistic, isn't it?— which means that a more hopeful future depends on teaching the younger generation the skills necessary to be able to succeed in the 21st century.
And we want to help. We've done some interesting work here, and the American people need to know that our commitment, our bilateral aid in Guatemala, goes toward helping meet education goals. It's in the interest of the United States that there be literate populations in our neighborhood. In the city, in the Department of Iximche, we established a project that helped raise the number of children who complete first grade from 51 percent to 71 percent. It's not a well-known program, but it worked. And this country of mine is committed to helping make these kind of programs successful, Mr. President.
We also want to expand access to health care. Today, as the President mentioned, we went to Santa Cruz Balanya; it was a really interesting moment. The American people would have been incredibly proud of watching our military folks dispense with basic health care needs to people who needed help. And the people of Guatemala would be especially proud to have seen your military working side by side with our troops to do the same thing. There's a great mission of compassion, and it's making a difference to people's lives.
Imagine not being able to see, and all of a sudden, somebody appears in your life, gives you an eye test, and fits you for glasses so you can see better. Or you have a perpetual toothache, and somebody shows up, in this case in military uniforms, and says, ""How can I help?"" It is in the interest of the United States to continue these kinds of missions, Mr. President.
It is estimated that we have served more than 160,000 Guatemalans since 2001, providing health care, basic health care needs. And I was sharing with the President a little earlier that we're going to set up a health care training mission in Panama, so that we can train trainers, so that people in Guatemala can come and get just the basic skills necessary to take back to their towns and villages to be able to dispense with basic health care.
The United States and Guatemala trade a lot, especially now that Guatemala has become a full member of CAFTA-DR. President Berger and I believe that CAFTA can spread opportunity, provide jobs, and help lift people out of poverty. We saw how trade can transform the small village of Chirijuyu, part of our experience in traveling with the President was to get outside the capital. It was really, really fun and really heartwarming. As a matter of fact, it was one of the great experiences of my Presidency. The town has grown from subsistence farming to selling high-value crops like lettuce and carrots and celery. As a matter of fact, I got to pack some lettuce. The President and I were hauling boxes of lettuce; we were putting them in the truck.
I met Mariano Canu. See, I talked about this man, Mariano Canu, in my speech in Washington, DC. I'd never met him, but I was intrigued by his story about how a fellow had gone from being a subsistence farmer, just scratching out a living, barely making it, the father of six kids wondering whether or not they would have a future, and then he organized an organization of small farmers called Labradores Mayas. And they came together and became more efficient, and then they found markets. They found markets throughout Central America as a result of CAFTA, and into the United States as a result of CAFTA.
And the guy is making a living. He's making more than a living; he's built a thriving enterprise. You should have seen the look on his face, about how proud he was to show to the President of his country and the President of the United States the great progress being made.
As the President mentioned, I'm working with the United States Congress on comprehensive immigration reform. He asked me about an incident that took place up in Massachusetts the other day. I said, ""Yes, we're going to enforce the laws in our country, just like you should enforce the laws in yours."" It is against the law for somebody to hire somebody who is in our country illegally to work. And therefore, the deportations took place as a result of law enforcement enforcing the law. This wasn't—they didn't say, ""Oh, maybe there's Guatemalans there; let's go get them."" That wasn't what happened, just so you know. You've got to understand that when we enforce the law, we do so in a fair and rational way. It just so happened that Guatemalans were working there illegally.
He also mentioned to me that there's some conspiracies about how children are being left behind in Guatemala. No es la verdad. That's not the way America operates. We're a decent, compassionate country. Those are the kind of things we do not do. We believe in families, and we'll treat people with dignity. And the system needs to be fixed. And so we spent time talking about our strategy to get comprehensive immigration reform out of the Congress.
As I told the President, it seems like to me, we've got to get this done by August. I hope so. I don't want to put a timetable on the legislative process. Timetables are generally meant to be broken. We don't believe in timetables, but I do believe in pressing hard and working with Democrats and Republicans to get it done, Mr. President. And we want there to be a rational way for people to come and do jobs Americans aren't doing. We don't want people to feel like they have to get stuffed into the back of a truck and pay exorbitant fees to coyotes to come and try to realize dreams. There's got to be a better system.
And I told him the biggest problem in the debate is going to be what to do with the people who are already in our country illegally. And I explained to him, there will not be amnesty, automatic citizenship; it's just not going to happen. Nor is it feasible to try to kick everybody out of our country. That's not possible. And so I'm going to work with members of both parties to find a rational middle ground to have a comprehensive plan, Mr. President. It's important to you, but it's important to the United States of America to do this as well.
We also talked about adoption. I don't know if my fellow citizens understand this, but there are a lot of U.S. families who adopt babies from Guatemala—thousands of babies. This year, it is very important for the United States and Guatemala to implement the Hague Convention on adoptions to help protect children and families during the adoption process. We found common ground on that issue. And I appreciate your strong stand, Mr. President, and I assured the President we would follow through ourselves.
I can't thank you enough for your leadership. I appreciate the vision you have for your country. When you speak, you speak with passion, because you care deeply about the future of Guatemala, and you care deeply about the people of Guatemala. It's an honor to be with you. It's been a joyful trip for us. I'm looking forward to the dinner that you're hosting for Laura and me. I'm not going to talk too long because I might get too hungry. [Laughter] But thank you for your time.
President Berger. Thank you, Mr. President. Very nice—[inaudible]. Thank you. Thank you, President Bush. I have here a note where I'm asked to make reference to the members of the media who are going to ask questions.
Go ahead, Francisco.
Illegal Immigrants
Q. President Bush, good afternoon. Mr. President, deportations continue. At the end of 2006, and only a week ago, this practice of deporting, of arresting immigrants and beginning a process of deportation, continued. In Guatemala, information of abuse of authority and lack of respect for the right of the Guatemalan immigrants has been disseminated. My question is, now that you are in Guatemala, is there a commitment from your country to the 13 million Guatemalans to cease these deportations since you expect to have a comprehensive immigration reform?
President Bush. The commitment is, people will be treated with respect, but the United States will enforce our law. It's against the law to hire somebody who is in our country illegally, and we are a nation of law.
The best way to solve the concerns of the citizens of Guatemala—listen, I fully understand that the citizens of Guatemala are concerned about their relatives or friends who are in the United States. And I appreciate that. The best way to address the concerns inherent in your question is for me to work with Congress to get a comprehensive bill. And I'm optimistic we can do so. It's going to be tough work— don't get me wrong—but I believe we can get a comprehensive bill out of the Congress.
And I think you'll find that—let me say, I certainly hope you'll find that people who are in the—that are interfacing with our Government are treated with respect and decency. That's certainly the instructions. Now, I'm sure they don't want to be sent home, but, nevertheless, we enforce laws. And I readily concede the system needs to be changed, and I hope I can convince the majority of both the House and the Senate to change the law in a rational way.

Congressional Action on Immigration Reform
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. May I extend good wishes to your father's health.
President Bush. Thank you.
Q. You've spoken throughout this trip about the——
President Bush. That's actually a kind gesture. Thank you.
Q. You've spoken throughout the trip about the need for comprehensive immigration reform. It's been a big subject here in Guatemala City. Can you provide a little more detail, sir, if you would, about how you intend to overcome congressional opposition? There is opposition in both parties, specifically at the moment. A bill has been expected for some time now. You've been working with Senators, and your staff have been working with Senators. Is there a holdup? How are you tackling the problem at the moment, sir?
President Bush. Yes. No, I appreciate that. He's referring to the process at this point in time, about why hadn't a consensus bill in the Senate began to emerge. And it's because this is a complicated issue that requires both parties learning to work together on this issue. I believe it is, first of all, incumbent to find, as best as possible, a coherent Republican position in the Senate. And that's where we're spending a lot of time right now. And then, as I understand it, Senator Kennedy will be carrying the bill on the Democrat side, and then once we can get a coherent Republican position, one that most Republicans are comfortable with, then we'll start working with the Senator.
As you know full well that if we don't have enough consensus, nothing is going to move out of the Senate. And if nothing moves out of the Senate, nothing is going to happen in the House. And so therefore, the initial stages of getting a bill that meets objections is time consuming, but it is worth it and necessary in order for us to be able to address the concerns, many of which were expressed during the last debate on immigration reform.
Now, I'm optimistic, I really am. I believe we can get something done, and I believe we're beginning to find consensus. I think there is pretty widespread consensus that there ought to be a temporary-worker plan that says, you can come legally to the United States to do a job Americans are not doing, for a period of time. That will help a lot of the Guatemalan citizens. It will mean somebody, first of all, doesn't have to sneak in the country in the first place and pay a coyote or buy forged documents or sleep in some sleazy place hiding from authorities until you're able to make destination. You'll be able to come in, in a rational way.
Secondly, that once you're in the United States, if you have to come home to be with your family, you'll be able to do so in a legal way; in other words, you'll be able to come back and forth without fear. Now, you won't be able to—there will be a time limit on the amount of time, and that's part of the negotiations.
The hard issue, as the President noted and I just talked about, was what to do with the people who've been in our country for more than a limited period of time. And that's a difficult issue, and it's one that's got a lot of politics in the country. The idea of giving someone automatic citizenship is just not acceptable. It's not acceptable to a lot of people in our country, and, Massimo, you understand that. And yet the fundamental question is, how do you design a system that doesn't raise those fears? And yes, obviously, he didn't like my answer. Oh, you did like it? Well, good. [Laughter]
My dad had been ill, and he kindly brought greetings, for which I am grateful.
Legislative Agenda on Immigration Reform
Q. Thank you, sir. That was very specific. That's a lot, though. Do you think you can get that done by August?
President Bush. Well, I—you know, August is a date that I was musing about, and that date came to mind because I understand how difficult it can be coming down the stretch in the legislative session in a calendar year, because the appropriations bill—you're learning more about this than you probably want to know—but the appropriations bills begin to crowd out the calendar in the latter part of the year. And they can consume a lot of time.
And therefore, my hope is—it's certainly not a promise, but my hope would be— that we'd be able to get something out of the Senate and then into the House, and something—then they can work the conference in the fall. That would be the hope.
And—but I'm not the person that sets the calendar. I'm just a simple member of the executive branch. [Laughter] It's the legislative branch that decides the calendar.
And—go ahead.
President Berger. I would like to say that, in fact, the Guatemalan people would have preferred a more clear and positive response, no more deportations, so to say. But, as the President has said, there is a legal framework that needs to be respected. But historically, I think that we have never been so close to finding a solution to this problem as now.
I was very pleased to hear President Bush say that this is a problem that they also have. It is not only a problem for migrants, it is a problem for the American citizens who have—and a problem that has to be resolved. We have never before been as close as we are at this time of seeing a light at the end of the tunnel and, in a near future, in getting the undocumented status changed for 13 million illegal aliens who are living in the U.S.
Narcotics and Drug Trafficking/Death of Salvadoran Congressmen
Q. Good afternoon, President Bush and President Berger. President Bush, in Guatemala, there is a very serious problem of drug trafficking. You talk about a regional strategy to tackle it. I would like to ask you to expand on this topic, also taking into account that the latest reports produced by the United States on Guatemala have not been very favorable. And also, the issue of drug trafficking has led to very serious security problems in Guatemala. The latest was the murder of three Salvadoran Congress Members. The U.S. is also participating in this investigation. How far will the U.S. cooperation go? Because there is also the request for a mini-Colombia Plan to face it.
President Bush. Yes. The drug trafficking is very serious—a serious problem for the United States, and so—most of the drugs end up in the United States, which really says that we need to do a better job of convincing our citizens not to use drugs. If demand for the drugs went down, it could make it more difficult for the drug traffickers to find markets.
Secondly, drug trafficking is a serious problem because narcotrafficking destabilizes areas. It's in our interests, in our country, to promote prosperity and peace and stability. Narcotraffickers promote instability and tensions, which make it hard for the general populous to become prosperous. It also turns out, narcotraffickers oftentimes leave behind the poison as they head to other markets; in other words, the local population can become deeply affected by drogas.
And so this is a serious issue. We've had experience in dealing with one state that obviously had to deal with the potential of narcotraffickers undermining democracy, and that's Colombia. This is—in my judgment, the best way to deal with this problem and to convince others throughout our country that it makes a lot of sense to commit assets is to think regionally, because as the President mentioned, he said, one of the interesting dynamics that's taking place here is that people and goods are moving quite freely across borders. Well, if people and goods are moving quite freely, drug traffickers will be moving quite freely. And there's kind of almost a border-less domain for these people.
And therefore, thinking regionally—and that includes the United States and Mexico and Central America. Now, I'll bring this up with President Calderon tomorrow, about how we can work constructively. A lot of this has to do with sharing of information; in other words, we pick up pretty good information at times. After all, the United States, oftentimes, is the endpoint, is the end of the distribution chain. And sometimes our DEA or folks can trace back movements of drugs, which might then be able to help the region be able to disrupt and affect.
Look, I am a ""if they break the law, arrest them"" person. I think we ought to go find these people and bring them to justice. And it's tough, because the richer they become, the more lethal they become and the more dangerous they are to democracies. And that's why there needs to be a collaborative effort, the details of which will emerge as we continue to strategize. But step one is to share information.
As to the Salvadorans, of course, I'm deeply concerned about their death, as is the President. And we have sent, I think, four FBI agents down here to help with forensics and to help track down the leads, so that wherever those killers may light, the authorities can go get them. And that's what we need to do.
But this is a serious issue, and we spent a lot of time talking about it.
Elaine [Elaine Quijano, Cable News Network].
This will be your last question, Mr. President, and then we can start thinking about dinner, la cena. Que vamos a comer?
President Berger. Tortillas.
President Bush. Tortillas? Que bueno. [Laughter]
President Berger. We have tortillas with guacamole and beans.
President Bush. Con almuerzo, hoy.
Border Security/Immigration Reform/Trade
Q. Thank you. President Bush, your decision to sign legislation authorizing construction of a fence along the U.S.-Mexico border was not viewed positively here in the region. How would you respond to critics who feel that that sent a message that Latin Americans are not welcome in the United States?
And, President Berger, what are your thoughts on the idea of a fence, the U.S. border policy in regard to a fence?
President Bush. I did sign legislation modernizing our border. It was more than just fence; it was infrastructure—kind of a novel infrastructure, like detection devices, berms. We've got a very long border, and it needs to be enforced. It needs to be enforced not only to stop coyotes, but it needs to be enforced to stop drugs. It needs to be enforced to stop potential terrorists, and it needs to be enforced to stop arms—by the way, arms that sometimes go the other way—I'm told. And so we've got to have border. That's what countries do; they enforce their borders.
And so we modernized the border. It was more than just fence. And I understand it sent a signal that said, you're not welcome. Quite the contrary: People are welcome, but under the law. There are thousands of people in our country who are not citizens who are there legally. The question is, what do we do with people who have been there over years, the result of a law that isn't working well? And I've already given that answer.
I will also explain that part of convincing people that a comprehensive plan can work is to assure the American people that we're doing our duty by enforcing law. In other words, a lot of citizens said, ""You just don't care about whether or not we have a border that's secure."" And the Congress responded by saying, ""Of course, we care."" It is the first step toward a comprehensive bill. In other words, people in Congress were saying, ""Let us do something about border enforcement, and then let's go comprehensive."" I hope that's what they're saying.
In other words, that's what I'm pressing them to say. Okay, we've responded to the needs of border enforcement; there are people being sent back. As a matter of fact, I think it's interesting—and frankly, I didn't anticipate this—that the good press corps of Guatemala, reflecting the concerns of the Guatemalan people, and the President of Guatemala reflecting the concerns, asked me about deportations. I mean, that was a primary concern. It means that something is—the law is being enforced, is what that means.
The American people need to be persuaded, Elaine, that the Government takes our responsibilities seriously, which then will make it easier to convince reluctant Members of Congress to come up with a comprehensive plan.
Now, I've always been for a comprehensive plan. You might remember, if you look back at some of my speeches—I know you didn't listen to any of them, but you might want to go back and read them. [Laughter] Well, that's not fair. Okay, anyway, but I've always felt it was important. And I learned firsthand how important it was as the ","Governor of Texas. I used to say, family values do not stop at the Rio Grande River and that people are coming to do jobs Americans are not doing because they want to feed their families. That's why I said that.
By the way, the reason why trade is important in helping the programs like Labradores Mayas is that I also believe most citizens in Guatemala would rather find meaningful jobs at home instead of having to travel to a foreign land to work. And therefore, the more we can enhance prosperity in our neighborhood, the more we can encourage trade that actually yields jobs and stability, the less likely it is somebody who is worried about putting food on the table for their family will be coming to the United States.
Anyway, I thank you for your interest on the topic, Mr. President. It's been a wonderful press conference. Thank you.
President Berger. I would like to close with that topic: the American Dream for everyone. And we can have that American Dream in our own countries by promoting education, by improving infrastructure, by implementing CAFTA, which is a very interesting tool to produce and to export and also to attract investment and generate jobs. I would believe that we are firm along those lines and that the American Dream is going to be the dream for all the Americans living in the American Continent.
Thank you very much.
President Bush. Thank you all."

Bush, The President's News Conference With President Felipe de Jesus Calderon Hinojosa in Merida Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/272005",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-felipe-de-jesus-calderon-hinojosa-merida,"President Calderon. Good morning, Mr. President, dear friends from the media. I thank you for being here in this press conference. I would like to thank very sincerely President George Bush for visiting our country and for dedicating almost 3 days to his visit in Mexico.
I am very pleased to inform you that President George Bush and myself, we're fully satisfied for how fruitful this meeting has been for both countries. As leaders of sovereign nations, we have talked in a respectful environment and a cordial environment about very diverse and complex issues of our bilateral agenda. We coincided in sharing our core responsibility, which now, more than ever, happened to be a shared responsibility. We reiterate our commitment with democracy, with the defense and respect of human rights, the promotion of free trade, with the rule of law, security, sustainable development and, in particular, our fight against poverty.
From this platform of understanding, we have covered in detail each of the issues of our bilateral agenda. I would like to express my gratitude to President Bush that we have talked so openly, with the sincerity and respect of both countries that are not only neighbors, but they are pursuing to do what true friends should do.
We have talked, for example, about the strengthening of a task force that will be directed to the transition of full trade of sensitive products such as corn and beans. We talked about the need to cover the phenomenon of migration as a factor of prosperity for both nations, orderly migration process. And we acknowledged the effort that President Bush and his administration is doing in order to promote within the Congress a comprehensive migratory reform that will acknowledge the rights of the migrants and workers, that would allow orderly and legal programs for temporary jobs, and would allow the reunification of family ties.
We have expressed our concern for protecting and guaranteeing human rights of those who cross the border and, above all, about the enormous relevance of generating in Mexico opportunities that the citizens need for their development.
We shared the need of having a safe border that will close the gates to drugs, arms, and terrorism and that will open its doors to trade, prosperity and trade. Our border should be a tightening and closing point; the border should bring us together and not separate us. For this, we are considering the possibility of establishing new cross points and border bridges that will speed up the transit of goods and people. Both Presidents have agreed to coordinate in a better way our actions in order to confront organized crime in both sides of the border.
Mexico and the United States are nations that are joined together in the pursuit for better levels of well-being for its people. We do have the means, and, in this meeting, we have seen the political will in order to reach shared goals. I'm fully convinced, then, from this visit on, we will be able to start a new stage of the relationships that take place between Mexico and the United States.
President Bush. Senor Presidente, gracias. Buenos dias. Laura and I have had a fascinating trip, and our final stop was a really good one, Mr. President. Glad to be back in Mexico. This is an especially beautiful part of your wonderful country. The hospitality was very generous, and the meals were quite good. [Laughter] Estoy lleno. [Laughter]
Over the past 2 days, the President and I have had a very—a series of friendly and very productive meetings. That's what the people of our respective countries expect. They expect people to work out differences in a constructive way. They expect leaders to seize opportunities for the benefit of our respective peoples. And the spirit is very strong to work together.
I appreciate so very much the fact that during our meetings, we reaffirmed the values of democracy and transparency and rule of law that guide both our countries. We discussed ways to make our Nation safer, both nations safer and both nations prosperous.
President Calderon is taking a tough stand against organized crime and drugs, and I appreciate that. I made it very clear to the President that I recognize the United States has a responsibility in the fight against drugs. And one major responsibility is to encourage people to use less drugs. When there is demand, there is supply. And to the extent, Mr. President, that we can continue to make progress to reduce drugs, it will take pressure off of Mexico. So we have a responsibility.
Mexico has a responsibility as well, and the President is working hard on that responsibility. And we agreed to work together. Mexico is obviously a sovereign nation, and the President, if he so chooses, like he has, will lay out an agenda where the United States can be a constructive partner.
And the other place where we can work together is in the region. And so the President, who is a very strong leader in Central America, for example, will work with the United States and the Central American countries to develop a regional plan, because it could be successful in Mexico, and yet the problem could be transferred to the south, in which case we wouldn't have the security we would want. So, Mr. President, thank you for your leadership on this issue. I'm looking forward to working with you on it.
We talked about the economy. My view is, is that when Mexico grows, the United States benefits. And obviously, to the extent, Mr. President, you're able to put forth your innovative policies, we applaud your efforts. I appreciate so very much some of the innovative ideas that you're putting forward. As I said last night in the dinner, I appreciate very much the fact that you're focusing development in the south of your country.
Obviously, there was a lot of discussion about trade. People in my country are concerned about trade; people in Mexico are concerned about trade. There are strong protectionist sentiments in the United States. And I will work, Mr. President, to reject those protectionist sentiments, because I believe trade is one of the best avenues to help common prosperity. And anytime we have trade relations, there will be complications. And I pledged to the President that we would work together to ensure a smooth transition to full trade in dealing with sensitive issues such as corn and beans.
Education is an important issue that is— for our two countries. And I appreciate your commitment to strong education. The United States can help. I'm a big believer in student exchanges between our two nations, on both sides of the border. And one reason I am, is because I think it's important, sometimes, for people to gain an accurate perception of my country by coming to my country. I love for the fact that students travel back and forth.
Mr. President, this morning I met with some students that are funded through USAID programs, who have come to the United States to take different courses in different subjects, and then have come back to Mexico to lend the expertise that they have gained to improve the communities in which they live. This is a vital program that the United States must continue, in my judgment, in order to help people realize the great benefits of education.
We spent a lot of time on the important and sensitive issue of migration. I say ""sensitive"" because obviously this is an issue that people can use to inflame passions. I say ""important"" because a good migration law will help both economies and will help the security of both countries. And the reason I say that is that if people can come into our country, for example, on a temporary basis to work, doing jobs Americans aren't doing, they won't have to sneak across the border.
And by the way, a system that encourages people to sneak across the border is a system that leads to human rights abuses. It's a system that promotes coyotes and document forgers. It's a system that allows for the exploitation of citizens who are trying to earn a living for their families.
And so, Mr. President, as we discussed, I will work with Congress, with members of both political parties, to pass immigration law that will enable us to respect the rule of law and, at the same time, respect humanity in a way that upholds the values of the United States of America.
I appreciate your hospitality. It's been a very warm greeting, Mr. President. I thank you and your good wife for being so kind to Laura and me. I look forward to future conversations. Muchas gracias.
President Calderon. Gracias, el Presidente. We will have a Q&A session now, starting with the Mexican press.
Mexico-U.S. Relations/Mexico's Foreign Policy
Q. Good morning, President of the United States of America, President of the United Mexico States.
President Bush. Perdoname.
Q. Good morning. Your visit is coming to an end now—this is a question for President George Bush: At the end of your visit, sir, have you found allies in order to place a counterweight to the initiatives of Hugo Chavez? What commitments did Felipe Calderon take on in order to be a counterweight to these initiatives of Hugo Chavez, on the one hand?
And on the other hand, President Felipe Calderon, Foreign Minister Patricia has said that you are working in order to strengthen the relationship with Venezuela. How is this compatible with the commitments that you're taking on with President Bush in order to give thrust to this counterweight in Latin America concerning Hugo Chavez?
President Bush. Thank you for the question. We spent a lot of time talking about Mexico's role in the world. Mexico is a respected nation; President Calderon is a respected leader. But our conversations focused on democracy and rule of law and prosperity and how to improve the lives of our fellow citizens. We spent time talking about social justice and concern for the poor.
One of the reasons I've come down here again is to remind people in this important part of the world that the United States cares deeply about the human condition; that we spent 1.6 billion of bilateral aid last year, most of the money going to social justice programs. And that doesn't include programs like the one I saw in the highlands of Guatemala, where our military was providing basic health care for citizens.
So, Mr. President and I spent time talking about how to advance a hopeful agenda, one that will lift the spirits of people. And I respect the role Mexico plays. I mean, Mexico will lead diplomatic efforts for the common security and common prosperity, and that's an important role.
President Calderon. The commitment and purpose of my Government is to have constructive, positive, and sound relations with all countries of the world and, of course, with the countries of Latin America, without exception. And certainly the more—the most important relationship with Mexico abroad is the one that we have with the United States, due to the migration that exists, the flows through the borders, and all else that you are well aware of.
However, Mexico is respectful of the opinions of other leaders. We are respectful of the heads of states of other countries, such as Venezuela and certainly the United States. We are a government that has principles and values, values such as democracy, freedom, liberty, and legality and certainly security and safety.
On the other hand, not as a strategy— this was not something that we focused on as a strategy in our talks, but as a conviction of our government. Mexico has to play a role which is balanced, weighed, and it has to be a leader in Latin America, in agreement with its culture, its history, its economy, its people.
We are deeply Latin American, and we, too, want justice, development, democracy for all of Latin America. That is where we are engaged, and we are committed. We certainly do agree and coincide with other countries, many countries, of course, who coincide and agree with those principles.
Department of Justice
Q. Mr. President, thank you. The Attorney General acknowledged yesterday that in a statement made by——
President Bush. Hold on, Roger [Roger Runningen, Bloomberg News]. The world wants to hear your voice.
Q. Thank you. The Attorney General acknowledged yesterday that there were mistakes in the firing of prosecutors. What is his future in your cabinet? Do you have confidence in him? And more importantly—or just as important—how effective can he be in Congress going forward when he's lost a lot of confidence among Democrats and doesn't have any defenders among Republicans?
President Bush. I do have confidence in Attorney General Al Gonzales. I talked to him this morning, and we talked about his need to go up to Capitol Hill and make it very clear to members in both political parties why the Justice Department made the decisions it made, making very clear about the facts. And he's right: Mistakes were made. And I'm frankly not happy about them, because there is a lot of confusion over what really has been a customary practice by the Presidents: U.S. attorneys and others serve at the pleasure of the President. Past administrations have removed U.S. attorneys; it's their right to do so.
The Justice Department recommended a list of U.S. attorneys. I believe the reasons why were entirely appropriate. And yet this issue was mishandled to the point now where you're asking me questions about it in Mexico, which is fine. I mean, if I were you, I'd ask the same question. This is an issue that—and so Al—let me just say, Al was right; mistakes were made; and he's going to go up to Capitol Hill to correct them.
I appreciate the fact that he's taken some action, because anytime anybody goes up to Capitol Hill, they've got to make sure they fully understand the facts and how they characterize the issue to Members of Congress. And the fact that both Republicans and Democrats feel like that there was not straightforward communication troubles me, and it troubles the Attorney General, so he took action. And he needs to continue to take action.
Immigration Reform/President Calderon's Meeting With Former President Vicente Fox of Mexico
Q. Good morning to both Presidents. President Bush, I ask you, why do Mexicans want to—why would you think that Mexicans could believe in a reform in migration when for so many years, this was not a possibility nor reality? And what are your chances of coming through with this bill in Congress? And President Calderon, you had lunch with President Fox. Can you tell us what you talked about?
President Bush. They talked about carne. [Laughter] Excuse me. I wasn't there. [Laughter]
No, that's a legitimate question, and the question is, why now? Why do I think something positive can happen? Well, first of all, the legislative process takes awhile in the United States. I don't know about Mexico, Mr. President, but sometimes legislators, you know, debate issues for awhile before a solution can be achieved.
And we had a very—by the way, we haven't had a serious debate on migration until recently. A law was passed in 1986, and then there really wasn't a serious debate until pretty much starting after the year 2000, if my memory serves me well. I've always known this is an important issue because I happened to have been the Governor of Texas. And so I'm very comfortable about discussing the issue and have elevated the issue over the past years. And Members of Congress have taken the issue very seriously, but it's hard to get legislation out of the Congress on a very complex issue.
A lot of Americans were deeply concerned that the United States was not enforcing our laws. They felt like there wasn't a commitment to the rule of law. Over the past year, I believe we have shown the American people that there is a strong commitment to the rule of law. And I think Members of Congress are now feeling more comfortable that the country is committed to rule of law, which then makes some more openminded to my argument, which is that if we can have migration reform, it will make it less likely somebody will feel like they have to sneak across our border, and, therefore, take pressure off the border. In other words, security for the country, border security, will be enhanced by a good migration law, and then it will make it easier for us to focus our assets on drugs, terrorists, criminals, and guns moving both ways.
I believe—I feel pretty good about it. I don't want to predict legislative successes. But I can tell you my mood, and my mood is optimistic because the mood in the Congress seems like it has changed from skepticism last year to knowledge that getting a comprehensive bill will be in the Nation's interests.
Secondly, I'm optimistic because Republicans in the Senate are working with Democrats in the Senate. We're facilitating that work. The administration is very much involved with helping the Senators find common ground, to the point where we can move a bill as quickly as possible out of the Senate so it gets to the House of Representatives.
I'm not a betting man. I don't like to bet, because when I do, I usually lose. But I'm an optimistic man, in this case, about getting comprehensive reform, and a bill is in the interests of both countries.
President Calderon. I met with former President Vicente Fox, whom I like, and we have a good friendship. We belong to the same party. I invited him to lunch; we talked for quite a while, talked about matters in a very constructive fashion. And he congratulated us for the work that we've done during these first 100 days. He also said that he had the will to collaborate and cooperate in a respectful fashion with the government for the benefit of Mexicans.
I have also met with other former Presidents, and I'm sure that I will continue to meet with President Fox in the future throughout my administration.
President Bush. Here it comes.
Department of Justice
Q. Thank you, Mr. President, President Calderon. On the dismissal of U.S. attorneys: There have been allegations that political motivations were involved. Is political loyalty to your administration an appropriate factor? And when you talked to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales last year, what did you say? And what did you direct him to do?
President Bush. Thanks, Kelly [Kelly O'Donnell, NBC News]. I've heard those allegations about political decisionmaking; it's just not true. Secondly, just so you know, I get asked—I mean, I get complaints all the time from Members of Congress on a variety of subjects—this Senator, this Congressperson so-and-so—and there's occasionally frustration with the executive branch. And they will pull me aside and say, ""Are you aware of this? Are you aware of that?"" And I did receive complaints about U.S. attorneys.
I specifically remember one time I went up to the Senate, and Senators were talking about the U.S. attorneys. I don't remember specific names being mentioned, but I did say to Al last year—you're right, last fall, I said, ""Have you heard complaints about AGs? I have""—I mean, U.S. attorneys, excuse me—and he said, ""I have."" But I never brought up a specific case nor gave him specific instructions.
Q. Sir, might he have inferred that you discussed it with him—was a need for him to take action?
President Bush. You're going to have to ask Al that question, but as I say, I discuss with my Cabinet officials complaints I hear. I mean, when Members of the Senate come up and say to me, ""I've got a complaint,"" I think it's entirely appropriate and necessary for me to pass those complaints on. Now, I don't every single time, but people view their moment with the President, sometimes, as an opportunity to unload their frustrations about how things may be working in their State—or Congresspersons, how things may be working in their district. And whether it be the Attorney General or the Secretary of State or other members of my Cabinet, I pass those complaints on at times.
What Al did was, and what the Justice Department did was appropriate—U.S. attorneys serve at the pleasure of the President. In other words, they're appointed by the President; they can be removed by the President. What was mishandled was the explanation of the cases to the Congress. And Al has got work to do up there. And the thing I appreciate about the Attorney General was, he said publicly that he could have handled it better—mistakes were made—and took action. And obviously, more action needs to be taken. That's what I discussed with him on the phone today.
Energy/Trade
Q. Good morning. President Calderon, concerning energy matters, 3 days before the celebration of the anniversary of the expropriation of oil in our country, could you tell us what the position of the Senators of opposition have stated about these matters of oil? We know that the reserves and, of course this oil abundance, perhaps, is coming to its end. Was this issue on oil discussed here?
And, President Bush, 2008 will welcome the opening up of livestock and agriculture matters. Sir, is there a possibility of renegotiating or, perhaps, leave it for a later date this negotiation of this part of the trade agreement because of the complaints of Mexican producers?
President Calderon. The truth of the matter is that we did not discuss this issue of oil, because this is something that has to do specifically with Mexicans. This is a Mexican issue. We will not privatize a company that belongs to Mexicans, such as of the case of Pemex. We will have to see this later on, in terms of sovereignty, and speak about the initiatives, of course, and to see what our Congress states. We do have problems with the decline of, especially, Cantarell, which has been very important in the production of oil throughout the years, but which is declining in amounts. But we will have to be very clear on the fact that we will be sharing responsibility between Congress and the President.
Concerning agriculture and livestock, I do share the sensitivity of our working group and President Bush. We have set up a working group to deal with the matters of corn and bean, precisely to make more agile this transition, which is established at the end of the free trade agreement, NAFTA.
We do have different problems now today, different from what it was 1 year ago, when we see that the prices of corn are going down. We are having very high costs in our production. This has left our producers out of competition. And now we are seeing what consumption is all about with these very high prices, in the case of corn.
However, due to the circumstance we have had in this meeting, we strengthened and we will be strengthening even more a group, a working group, which will address these issues, which are very sensitive for Mexican producers.
President Bush. No, no. Excuse me, Tony. One reason I didn't bring up energy is because energy is—it belongs to sovereign Mexico. And I'm confident that the President will make the best interests for the people of Mexico, working with the Congress.
In terms of opening up NAFTA, renegotiating NAFTA is a mistake, in my judgment. NAFTA has worked. And there is a mechanism in place, that the President just described, about how to resolve sensitive issues. There will be sensitive issues on a frequent basis when it comes to trade. And the best way to resolve those is through negotiations and discussions, recognizing the sensitivities on both sides of the border. But trying to renegotiate a treaty that has been incredibly important for both sides of the border, in my judgment, would be a mistake. You don't want to weaken NAFTA; you want to make sure it stays strong in order that prosperity continues to expand and people benefit on both sides of the border.
Immigration Reform/Immigrant Life in the United States
Q. Thank you. President Bush, you said the other day that you want to first—on immigration, want to first find a coherent Republican position in the Senate. Most Senate Republicans voted against last year's bill in the Senate. What changes are you willing to make? And would you be willing to forgo a path to citizenship as part of that bill? And, President Calderon, it's been reported you have relatives working in the United States. What have you learned from their experiences? Do you know, do they want to become citizens? And do you know, are they there legally? [Laughter]
President Bush. What was your question again? No. [Laughter] Michael Chertoff and Carlos Gutierrez are negotiating with Republicans, helping Republicans find common ground, Steve [Stephen Dinan, Washington Times], and this isn't the appropriate place to be conducting negotiations.
It is the appropriate place to talk about the spirit of moving the bill forward. And obviously, we would like to be able to convince no-voters that it makes sense to be for a comprehensive immigration policy. I feel strongly that it's in our interests, national interests, to get a bill done. That's why, after all, I took—I gave the address to the United States from the Oval Office on this very subject.
And you asked about amnesty—look, amnesty is not going to fly. There is not going to be automatic citizenship; it just won't work. People in the United States don't support that, and neither do I; nor will kicking people out of the United States work. It's not practical. It is not a realistic solution. Some may articulate that, but it's empty talk. And so therefore, there's got to be a middle ground, a reasonable way to deal with the 12 million or so people that have been in our country for a period of time. And that's where a lot of the discussions are taking place, Steve. And I think we can find a rational way forward, somewhere in between automatic citizenship and kicking people out of the country. It's in our interests we do so. I mean, we are a nation of law, and therefore, if we can change the law for the better, we ought to do so.
And so, Mr. President, back to the man's question over there, I'm optimistic. And— but he helped—his question was somewhat insightful—well, very insightful—because what he pointed out was the legislative challenges that we face. He also made it clear in his question that the administration is very much involved with working with Republican Senators to help find common ground between Republican Senators and Senator Kennedy, who is emerging as the lead Senator on the Democrat side.
I will tell you, if we can find that common ground, we have a very good chance of getting the bill out of the Senate, because Senator Kennedy is one of the best legislative Senators there is. He can get the job done. I know firsthand, because we reformed our education system, Mr. President, with his help in 2001. Not to slip in another issue, but we do need to get No Child Left Behind reauthorized, and I'm looking forward to working with Senator Kennedy on the reauthorization.
President Calderon. Yes, I do have family in the United States, and what I can tell you is that these are people who work and respect that country. They pay their taxes to the government. These are people who work in the field; they work with—in the fields with vegetables. They probably handle that which you eat—the lettuce, et cetera. These are people who respect the United States. These are people who have children, who want these children to be educated with respect for the land where they live and with respect for Mexico.
I am from Michoacan, and in Michoacan, we have 4 million people—2 million of these Michoacanos are in the States. We want them to come back; we want them to find jobs here in Mexico. We miss them. These are our best people. These are bold people—they're young, they're strong, they're talented, they have overcome tremendous adversity—who are working so that they can come back to their country someday.
And I'm saying this for all Mexicans, not only those Mexicans that I am related to by blood, by land, soil, air. And I want to say that I am fighting so that instead of having our people cross the border to find work, we want investments to cross the border and come over here.
The U.S. economy is capital intensive. We are labor intensive. We can give democracy to our people if we find sound basis so that we could also find those factors which can give jobs to our people. I have said this, and I will continue to say this: I hope—and I've hoped—that someday, everybody will believe as I do. I believe in work. I believe that I will see all of these people coming back, and embrace them knowing that, well, that we live in countries that defend liberty and freedom."
"May 17, 2007",The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Tony Blair of the United Kingdom,George W. Bush,"George W. Bush, The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Tony Blair of the United Kingdom Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/276155",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-tony-blair-the-united-kingdom-9,"President Bush. Thank you. I'm pleased to welcome Tony Blair back to the White House. He is a good friend. He has led the British people for a long time, since 1797. [Laughter]
You know, I was sitting with Tony on the Truman Balcony last night, and we were discussing a lot of issues. And it dawned on me, once again, what a clear strategic thinker he is. Somebody asked me the other day, how would you define Tony Blair and your relationship with him? I said, first of all, it's cordial; it's open; and I appreciate the fact that he can see beyond the horizon. And that's the kind of leadership the world needs.
I do congratulate the Prime Minister for being a—when he gets on a subject, it's dogged. Witness his patience and resolve regarding Northern Ireland. And congratulations for your leadership.
We talked about a lot of issues at dinner and our meetings. We talked about, of course, Iraq. As a matter of fact, the Prime Minister and I have just finished a video conference with our respective commanders and Ambassadors from Baghdad. We got a full briefing on the situation on the ground. I appreciated Tony's willingness to interface with our people there. I remind our people that the best decisions are made when you listen to the commanders. And our commanders have got good, specific advice as how to achieve our objectives—which I believe we'll achieve— objectives that I know are necessary for peace, peace in the Middle East, peace in the United States and the United Kingdom.
We talked about Afghanistan. We strongly support our NATO mission in Afghanistan, and I informed the Prime Minister that the Secretary General of NATO will be coming to Crawford this weekend. I'm looking forward to talking to him about how we can continue to work together. And I want to thank you for your strong commitment to the NATO mission and the people of Afghanistan.
We talked about the Middle East, and we're concerned about the violence we see in Gaza. We strongly urge the parties to work toward a two-state solution. I'm looking forward to continue to work on this issue. I've instructed my Secretary of State to be actively engaged. She represents the position of the Bush Government, which is two states living side by side in peace. We believe that vision is possible, but it requires strong leadership on both sides of the issue.
The Prime Minister and I discussed the humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people. We recognized the deep humiliation that can come as a result of living in a land where you can't move freely and where people can't realize dreams. We talked about the need to reject and fight terrorism. We understand the fright that can come when you're worried about a rocket landing on top of your home. I'm committed to peace in the Middle East, and I appreciate Tony Blair being a partner in peace.
We talked about Iran. We fully recognize that the Iranians must not have a nuclear weapon. And therefore, it's important for us to continue to work in the international arena to speak with one voice. And if we're unable to make progress with the Iranians, we want to work together to implement new sanctions through the United Nations to continue to make it clear that Iran with a nuclear weapon is not in the interests of peace in the world.
We talked about, of course, Africa. We spent a lot of time talking about Africa. I told the Prime Minister that the AIDS initiative that got started under my administration will continue, that I'll work with Congress to make sure that the PEPFAR initiative that has been so effective at getting antiretroviral drugs to people on that continent will continue. It's an important initiative of ours.
I applaud the Prime Minister's education initiative on the continent of Africa. It's a bold stroke. And we look forward to working with you on that initiative.
We talked about Darfur and how frustrated I am—and I know the Prime Minister is frustrated—at the inability for the international community to react with consequence in Darfur. And I explained to him my strategy of moving forward with sanctions and, hopefully, a new, stronger United Nations resolution if we don't see some improvement in the lives of the people there.
And we talked, of course, about climate change. We spent a lot of time on climate change. And I agree with the Prime Minister, as I have stated publicly: This is a serious issue, and the United States takes it seriously, just like we take energy security seriously. We talked about the upcoming G-8, and I assured the Prime Minister we want to be a part of a solution, that we want to work constructively together. He's got some really good ideas on how to advance the technologies that are going to be necessary to help solve this problem. And I told him I've got some good ideas as how to convince China and India to be a part of a global solution. We have a lot of common ground that we've been discussing today.
Finally, we agreed to improve defense cooperation by working towards an agreement reducing barriers to trade in defense goods and services and information between the United States and the United Kingdom, including defense industries. This is an important issue for the Prime Minister; it's an important issue to me. I made it clear to the Prime Minister we will work on this issue tirelessly until we can get it solved.
It's been a joy having you back here. I appreciate—every time I'm with you, I appreciate very much the insight you provide. And here, I guess, for the final time as Prime Minister, you get to address the good folks in our country from the Rose Garden.
Prime Minister Blair. Well, thank you very much, Mr. President, and thank you, as ever, for the kindness and graciousness of your welcome to me here at the White House. And thank you also for the strength of your leadership over the past few years. You have been a strong leader at a time when the world needed strong leadership. You've been unyielding and unflinching and determined in the fight that we face together. And I thank you for that.
And I also would take this opportunity of saying that I believe that the relationship between the United States of America and Britain is a relationship that is in the interests of our two countries and in the interests of the peace and stability of the wider world. And sometimes it's a controversial relationship, at least over in my country, but I've never doubted its importance. I've never doubted that it's based on principle, on shared values, and on a shared purpose, which is to make our world a better, more free, more just place in which people of all nations and all faiths can live. So, I would like to thank you for the strength, also, of that relationship over these past few years.
The President has, rightly and comprehensively, gone through the various issues that we discussed. And I would like to pick out from those, first of all, the discussion we were able to have with our Ambassadors and commanders in respect of Iraq, where there's no doubt at all it's immensely challenging, immensely difficult. But also, there is a huge amount that is being done, not just to improve the security there, which is important, but also in respect to the politics where, as they were telling us, there are the majority elements in each of the main communities, whether Sunni or Shi'a or Kurd, who actually want to live in peace with one another and want a future for that country that is not marred by terrorism and sectarianism. And we, of course, want to see that happen in the interests of that country and the interests of the stability of the wider region and the world.
Again, in respect of Afghanistan, where American troops and, of course, British troops, down in the Helmand Province, are doing an extraordinary job—a heroic job, actually—and I think we can be so proud of the Armed Forces of both countries and what they're doing in the world today. The situation is fraught with danger, which they take on with immense courage and immense determination.
And down in the south of Afghanistan at the moment, there are operations the whole time against the Taliban, in favor of, again, what the Afghan people want, which is the chance to have a better future and escape from the poverty and misery and oppression of the Taliban years.
We discussed, of course, the Middle East and the very dangerous, difficult situation there, and our belief, again, that the important thing is how we make progress towards the two-state solution, which is the only solution in the end that will offer a realistic prospect of progress in that region.
And of course, also, we talked about the upcoming G-8, where there's going to be important negotiations over the issue of climate change and over the issue of Africa. I mean, in respect of climate change, I welcome very much what the President has said today. I mean, the important thing is that we see if it is possible for people to come together on an agreement for the future that will allow us to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, that will allow us to have a way forward that involves not just Europe and the United States of America but China and India and the rest of the developing world also. And that also addresses what is an issue of top, top priority now in Europe but also, I know, here, which is energy security.
So, there are two reasons why this issue is on the agenda in a way that is perhaps more acute than ever before. There is the issue of the environment; there's the issue of energy security. And I think there's a synergy between those two issues and the way they come together, which offer some prospect of hope for the future.
And in respect of Africa, as you will know, at the Gleneagles summit a couple of years ago, we made Africa, if you like, the center piece of the summit. I think it's important that we recommit to the undertakings we gave there to help people in Africa and that we do not lose sight of that as a major—in some senses, the major moral course of our time, which is to lift people out of poverty on that troubled continent. And I totally agree with what the President was saying. We have the same position exactly on Darfur and the need to take action there.
And finally, can I thank the President for what he has said on the issue to do with defense and trade between our two countries. This is an issue that seems technical but actually is a very important way of trumpeting the understanding, the work that we're doing together on the issue of defense and technology between our two countries.
And so let me end where I began, which is the importance of the relationship between the United States and Britain. I mean, whether it's in respect of fighting terrorism, the big issues to do with energy and climate change, the cause that is Africa, the agreements between our two countries in respect of defense: our two nations should always work together. It's served us well in the past. But it's not a relationship that's founded on history, it's a relationship that is about a shared future.
Thank you.
President Bush. So as a parting gift to the Prime Minister, we'll take some questions. [Laughter]
Hunt [Terence Hunt, Associated Press].
United Kingdom-U.S. Relations/Emergency Supplemental Appropriations
Q. Thank you. Mr. Prime Minister, will Britain in the coming months and years be as staunch an ally in Iraq for the United States as it has been under your leadership?
And, Mr. President, will you sign a war spending bill that has consequences for the Iraqi Government if it fails to meet benchmarks for progress?
Prime Minister Blair. The answer to your question is yes, I believe that we will remain a staunch and steadfast ally in the fight against terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere.
Let me just explain one thing that came out very powerfully from the discussion we had with our commanders this morning. Essentially, what we have in Iraq at the moment is a situation where there is a renewed attempt to find political reconciliation, between Sunni and Shi'a, particularly. And I believe there are signs, real and genuine signs of progress there.
But what you are seeing in Iraq is an attempt by Al Qaida—through these appalling suicide bombs and, also, particularly down in the south, through the improvised explosive devices by Iranian-backed elements—to try to disturb any prospect of Sunni and Shi'a coming together and delivering what the people of Iraq want to see.
And the only point that I would make is this, and this is the reason why it's important that Britain holds steadfast to the course of fighting, alongside America in this battle against terrorism: The forces that we are fighting in Iraq—Al Qaida on the one hand, Iranian-backed elements on the other—are the same forces we're fighting everywhere. And over these past few weeks, you can see in different parts of the world—Morocco, Algeria, Pakistan, in Saudi Arabia recently—where this extremism is rearing its head, is trying to dislodge the prospects of stability and progress in so many different countries. There is no alternative for us but to fight it wherever it exists. And that is true whether it's in our own countries, which have both suffered from terrorism, or in Iraq or Afghanistan.
And so this is not a—it's not about us remaining true to the course that we've set out because of the alliance with America. It is about us remaining steadfast because what we are fighting, the enemy we are fighting, is an enemy that is aiming its destruction at our way of life and anybody who wants that way of life. And in those circumstances, the harder they fight, the more determined we must be to fight back.
If what happens is, the harder they fight, the more our will diminishes, then that's a fight we're going to lose. And this is a fight we can't afford to lose.
President Bush. I've instructed Josh to stay in touch with leaders—Josh Bolten, Chief of Staff, stay in touch with leaders— both Democrat and Republican, about moving a supplemental as quickly as possible. First, I applaud what Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi said, that time is of the essence; we've got to get the bill done, and if need be—I think they said—they would keep Members here to get the troops funded.
Secondly, I appreciate you trying to get me to negotiate here on the platform. Josh has been told that; we understand benchmarks are important. I talked specifically about benchmarks, and he'll work with Members of Congress to come up with a supplemental that we—both sides can live with. And I'm confident we can get the job done.
And there's been a series of votes in Congress that people have been able to express their opinion. Now it's time to put forth a spending bill that doesn't have artificial timetables for withdrawal, doesn't micromanage the military, and is wise about how we spend the people's money. And we'll work it hard, and I think we can get a deal.
Q. [Inaudible]—question?
President Bush. As I said, you're trying to get me to negotiate. Our negotiator is Josh. And we fully understand the need to have benchmarks in a bill. I accept, respect the Members' desire to have bench-marks—after all, I'm the person who laid them out initially. We will work through something we can all live with and enable us to get the job done.
And again, I—this is an issue that has been very emotional here in Washington. People have got strong opinions. I do appreciate the leadership of the Speaker and the leader in saying, okay, now let's work together and get it solved. Optimistic we can do so.
Finance Minister Gordon Brown of the United Kingdom/Prime Minister Blair
Q. Adam Boulton, Sky News. During the course of this visit, it has been confirmed that Gordon Brown is going to be the next British Prime Minister, taking over in 40 days' time. I wonder if I could have both your reactions to that. And, in particular, to Mr. Blair, what do you say to those people who are saying, now there is a new Prime Minister in place, you should go sooner? And to Mr. Bush, whether——
President Bush. That's a lovely question—isn't it?—for the guy. [Laughter]
Q. ——however inadvertently, you once said that you would like Tony Blair to stay for the duration of your Presidency. He's not doing that. Do you think you're partly to blame for that?
President Bush. I haven't polled the Labour conference, but could be. [Laughter] The question is, am I to blame for his leaving? I don't know.
Q. And what do you think of Brown?
President Bush. I hope to help him in office the way Tony Blair helped me. Newly elected President, Tony Blair came over, and he reached out; he was gracious—was able to converse in a way that— where our shared interests were the most important aspect of the relationship. I would hope I would provide the same opportunities for Gordon Brown. I met him; thought he was a good fellow.
But my attitude is this: This man here is the Prime Minister; we've got a lot of work to do until he finishes. He's going to sprint to the wire. He's going to finish the job that the people want him to do, and I'm going to work with him to do it. The meetings today weren't—this wasn't, like, a farewell deal; this was ""how can we continue to work together for the common good?"" And that's what we'll do.
As to why things happen politically in Great Britain, I'd suggest you go over there and ask people. Nice to see you again. [Laughter]
Prime Minister Blair. You had kind of forgotten what the British media were like, hadn't you? [Laughter] But these things——
President Bush. He woke up to ask the question. [Laughter]
Prime Minister Blair. First of all, I'm— having signed Gordon's nomination forms to nominate him as leader, of course I wish him well, and I believe he'll make a great Prime Minister. And I know he believes in the relationship with America too. And as for me, I mean, I will carry on doing the things that I've set out over the next few weeks that I need to do, not least and what we're talking about with the upcoming G-8 summit and the deal which we've been trying to put together, different countries involved on climate change and Africa.
And then, of course, you've got the European agreement then at the end of June, which is going to be very important. And just let me to stress to you, incidentally, there will be a Government position. I mean, that's—it will be a Government negotiation that goes on there. But it's very, very important so that we can make sure that Europe moves forward. And then, of course, there are various domestic issues, too, as well.
But I—I'll answer the question about the President, as well, in relation to me. I mean, you can debate that as much as you like, but I want to say one thing to you, since it will be the last chance I get to do a—is to have a press conference in the Rose Garden, standing next to President Bush. I've admired him as a President, and I regard him as a friend. I have taken the view that Britain should stand shoulder to shoulder with America after September the 11th. I have never deviated from that view. I do not regret that view. I am proud of the relationship we have had. I am proud of the relationship between our two countries.
And I think that sometimes in politics, there are all sorts of issues where you've got to negotiate and compromise, but when it comes to the fundamental questions that affect our security and the future of the world, you should do what is right. I have tried to do that. And I believe that is what he has done as well. And——
Q. Would you do it again?
Prime Minister Blair. And I would take the same position of alliance with America again; yes, I would.
President Bush. Steve [Steve Holland, Reuters].
World Bank President Paul D. Wolfowitz
Q. Thank you, sir. The fate of Paul Wolfowitz appears to be hanging in the balance. After all we've heard in recent days, is it still possible for him to provide the kind of leadership needed at the Bank?
President Bush. First of all, I believe all parties in this matter have acted in good faith. I regret that it's come to this. I admire Paul Wolfowitz. I admire his heart, and I particularly admired his focus on helping the poor. There is a board meeting going on as we speak. All I can tell you is, I know that Paul Wolfowitz has a interest in what's best for the Bank and—just like he's had an interest in what's best for making sure the Bank focused on things that matter: human suffering, the human condition. I—and so I applaud his vision; I respect him a lot. And as I said, I regret that it's come to this right now.
Prime Minister Blair. David.
International Relations/Prime Minister Blair
Q. David Grossman from BBC Newsnight. Mr. Blair, you outlined some very big policy areas there in your discussions with the President. Is it really possible, do you think, to make significant progress on them in the time that you have left?
And, Mr. President, if I could ask you, is this really still the right man to be talking to?
President Bush. Yes. No question about it; it's the right man to be talking to. And, yes, we can get a lot done.
Prime Minister Blair. You know, we're going to have a G-8 summit in a couple of weeks' time, at which these issues to do with climate change in Africa are going to be debated and discussed. And, I mean, I hope very much, because you come together at the G-8, a bit like we did a couple of years ago at Gleneagles, and it's an opportunity for the international community, a major part of the international community, to come together and reach, in principle, agreements. And I think most people would accept that what happened at Gleneagles a couple of years ago was very important.
I think what happens in Germany in a couple of weeks' time could be equally important, and that will be the time when we come to those decisions. So, of course, I want to see that through, because I've been involved in this all the way through.
And the important thing, as well, is that I think you will find at the German summit that not just the G-8 countries are there, but also China and India and Brazil and Mexico, South Africa, maybe some of the African nations. And so it will be an opportunity for us to recommit on Africa and for the world to make important commitments on that and then to see if it's possible to agree the elements that could go into a more comprehensive climate change deal. So it's a pretty important thing, and that's what we're working on.
President Bush. You know, it's interesting, like trying to do a tap dance on his political grave, aren't you? I mean, this—you don't understand how effective Blair is, I guess, because when we're in a room with world leaders and he speaks, people listen. And they view his opinion as considered and his judgment as sound.
And I find it interesting the first two questions are, is this the right guy? Well, he happens to be your Prime Minister, but more importantly, he is a respected man in the international arena. People admire him. Even if they may not agree with him 100 percent, they admire him a lot. And it's not just the American President who admires him; a lot of people admire him. And so he's effective. He's effective because he is—his recommendations to solve problems are sound. He's also effective because he is the kind of person who follows through.
There's a lot of blowhards in the political process, you know, a lot of hot-air artists, people who have got something fancy to say. Tony Blair is somebody who actually follows through with his convictions and, therefore, is admired in the international community.
And so I guess this is the appropriate question to ask, right guy, or is he still standing? Yes. This guy is a very strong, respected leader, and he's absolutely the right guy for me to be dealing with.
Kelly [Kelly O'Donnell, NBC News]. By the way, if I'm not mistaken, this is your birthday. It is? Would you like me and the Prime Minister to do a duet, you know? [Laughter]
Q. I didn't realize the intel briefing was so far-reaching. [Laughter]
President Bush. That's right. Kelly O'Donnell.
Terrorist Surveillance Program
Q. Thank you, sir. There's been some very dramatic testimony before the Senate this week from one of your former top Justice Department officials, who describes a scene that some Senators called stunning, about a time when the wireless—when the warrantless wiretap program was being reviewed. Sir, did you send your then Chief of Staff and White House Counsel to the bedside of John Ashcroft while he was ill to get him to approve that program? And do you believe that kind of conduct from White House officials is appropriate?
President Bush. Kelly, there's a lot of speculation about what happened and what didn't happen; I'm not going to talk about it. It's a very sensitive program. I will tell you that, one, the program is necessary to protect the American people, and it's still necessary because there's still an enemy that wants to do us harm.
And therefore, I have an obligation to put in place programs that honor the civil liberties of the American people, a program that was, in this case, constantly reviewed and briefed to the United States Congress. And the program, as I say, is an essential part of protecting this country.
And so there will be all kinds of talk about it. As I say, I'm not going to move the issue forward by talking about something as highly sensitive, highly classified subject. I will tell you, however, that the program is necessary.
Q. Was it on your order, sir?
President Bush. As I said, this program is a necessary program that was constantly reviewed and constantly briefed to the Congress. It's an important part of protecting the United States, and it's still an important part of our protection because there's still an enemy that would like to attack us. No matter how calm it may seem here in America, an enemy lurks. And they would like to strike. And they would like to do harm to the American people because they have an agenda. They want to impose an ideology; they want us to retreat from the world; they want to find safe haven. And these just aren't empty words; these are the words of Al Qaida themselves.
And so we will put in place programs to protect the American people that honor the civil liberties of our people and programs that we constantly brief to Congress.
Prime Minister Blair. Hi, Tom.
United Kingdom-U.S. Relations
Q. Hello. [Inaudible]—Prime Minister— [inaudible]—many times in the course of the last 6 years. But it's been 5 years since a leader of the British Conservative Party set foot in this city. Mr. President, does it surprise you that aides close to David Cameron say that he does not want to be seen with you? And can I ask you both what it means for the prospect of future relations between Britain and America when the leader of the opposition dare not set foot in Washington?
President Bush. Well, I can just tell you, my relationship with the leader of Great Britain has been unbelievably productive, and I have enjoyed working with Tony Blair more than I could have possibly imagined.
It's hard to define our relationship in sound bites or press conferences, or to— in a way that really reflects the depth of what we have done together. And so I— you know, I don't regret things about what may or may not have happened over the past 5 years. I honor a relationship that I truly believe has been laying the foundation for peace.
This may not interest you, but I'll tell you anyway. I read three histories on George Washington last year. It's interesting to me that they're still analyzing the Presidency of our first President. And my attitude is, if they're still analyzing 1, 43 doesn't need to worry about it. [Laughter] I'm not going to be around to see the final history written on my administration.
When you work on big items, items to— agendas based upon sound philosophy that will transform parts of the world to make it more peaceful, we're not going to be around to see it. So my—let me finish. My relationship with this good man is where I've been focused, and that's where my concentration is. And I don't regret any other aspect of it.
And so I—we filled a lot of space together. We have had a unique ability to speak in terms that help design common strategies and tactics to achieve big objectives. And it's—will I miss working with Tony Blair? You bet I will. Absolutely. Can I work with the next guy? Of course.
And I'm here to make it clear to the people of our respective countries that this relationship is one that is vital to accomplish big objectives. It has been vital in the past; it has stood the free world—it has enabled the free world to do hard things. And it's a relationship that I believe is necessary to do the hard things in the 21st century. And so I honor Tony Blair.
Q. What about David Cameron?
President Bush. Never met him.
Prime Minister Blair. Well, I don't—I mean, I—it's not for me to give advice to the leader of the Conservative Party or a different political party. And that's up to them as to what they do and up to him as to whether he comes here or not.
But I do just make this observation to you, and—that what we are trying to do is—never mind these two individual leaders, but the two countries; let's accept for a moment that at least—even if people very strongly disagree with Iraq, for example— that at least people understand that there is a battle that we are fighting around the world today.
And let's at least accept, also, that it's a battle about the type of values that govern the world in the early 21st century. You don't win those battles by being a fair-weather friend to your ally. You don't win those battles by being hesitant or withdrawing support for each other when the going gets tough. You don't win those battles by losing the will to fight if your enemy's will to fight is very strong and very powerful.
And actually, the values that we represent, as two countries, are shown by what we—what we've been through today. I mean, the President gets tough questions from the American p","ress corps; I get, I like to say, even tougher questions—[laughter]—or at least as tough questions in the British press corps. And——
President Bush. If you want to define them as tough. [Laughter]
Prime Minister Blair. And we can—here as we speak at this press conference, I mean, I can't make out the words that they're shouting over there, but I bet they're not totally complimentary to either of us. [Laughter]
President Bush. Wait a minute. I don't know about that. [Laughter]
Prime Minister Blair. I mean, it could be the supporters we brought in, but I've got a feeling the likelihood is, no. [Laughter] And that's what it's about. It's about democracy, and it's about people being free to express their views, and it's about politicians having to face the pressure to justify their decisions, to be punished if the people don't like those decisions. And it's a commonality of values that we have that is so important for the world today.
And so you know, yes, of course, it's like—anybody who's sitting there advising a politician in any part of Europe today, if you want to get the easiest round of applause, get up and attack America. You can get a round of applause if you attack the President. You get a——
President Bush. Standing ovation. [Laughter]
Prime Minister Blair. Yes. And that's fine if everyone wants to do that, but when all of that is cleared away, you're left with something very, very simple, fundamental, and clear, that that battle for values is still going on.
And you can debate about the mistakes and the issues, and you can debate about Iraq, whether we should have done this, or we should have done that. But actually, what is happening in Iraq today is that our enemy is fighting us, and, therefore, if what happens when our enemy fights us is that we drift away from our friends, that we kind of make the little accommodations so that we don't escape some of the difficulty and the responsibility and, occasionally, opprobrium of decisionmaking, if we do that, our enemy takes heart from that; they watch that. They watch what we're doing the whole time. They ask, ""Are these guys standing up for what they believe, or if we carry on, is their will going to diminish and they're going to give up because it's just too difficult, because the public opinion is too difficult, because the opinion polls tell them it's too difficult?""
Now, that is the decision of leadership. And it's not just a decision for me and him; it's a decision for everybody who's engaged in politics. And people run down politics and say it's all just a series of positions and attitudes and sound bites and, occasionally, even lies and all the rest of it. Actually, what politics is in the end, when it's done in the right way, when people stand up for what they believe, is, it's about public service. And there's nothing to be ashamed of in that. And the fact is, the decisions are difficult; of course, they're difficult.
And we took a decision that we thought was very difficult. I thought then and I think now, it was the right decision. History will make a judgment at a particular time. But one thing I know is that what we represent coming here today, speaking in the Rose Garden to you people and getting your questions and being under your pressure, that is a finer and better way of life than either a brutal, secular dictatorship or religious extremism. It's a better way of life, and it's the way of life, actually, people, any time they are given the choice, choose to have. And what we should be about, our two nations, is giving as many people in the world as possible that choice and being proud of it.
President Bush. What I know is, the world needs courage. And what I know is, this good man is a courageous man.
Thanks for coming. Appreciate you."
"May 24, 2007",The President's News Conference,George W. Bush,"George W. Bush, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/275185",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1137,"The President. Please be seated. Thank you all. Good morning.
Today Congress will vote on legislation that provides our troops with the funds they need. It makes clear that our Iraqi partners must demonstrate progress on security and reconciliation. My administration and Members of Congress from both parties have had many meetings to work out our differences on this legislation. As a result, we've removed the arbitrary timetables for withdrawal and the restrictions on our military commanders that some in Congress had supported.
We were also successful in removing billions of—in unrelated domestic spending that many of the Democrats were insisting on. I wanted to remove even more. But, still, by voting for this bill, members of both parties can show our troops and the Iraqis and the enemy that our country will support our service men and women in harm's way.
As it provides vital funds for our troops, this bill also reflects a consensus that the Iraqi Government needs to show real progress in return for America's continued support and sacrifice. The Iraqi Study Group—the Iraq Study Group recommended that we hold the Iraqi Government to the series of benchmarks for improved security, political reconciliation, and governance that the Iraqis had set for themselves. I agree; so does the Congress. And the bill reflects that recommendation.
These benchmarks provide both the Iraqi Government and the American people with a clear roadmap on the way forward. Meeting these benchmarks will be difficult; it's going to be hard work for this young government. After all, the Iraqis are recovering from decades of brutal dictatorship. Their democratic government is just over a year old. And as they're making tough decisions about their future, they're under relentless attack from extremists and radicals who are trying to bring down the young democracy.
Our new strategy is designed to help Iraq's leaders provide security for their people and get control of their capital so they can move forward with reconciliation and reconstruction. Our new strategy is designed to take advantage of new opportunities to partner with local tribes to go after Al Qaida in places like Anbar, which has been the home base of Al Qaida in Iraq.
This summer is going to be a critical time for the new strategy. The last of five reinforcement brigades we are sending to Iraq is scheduled to arrive in Baghdad by mid-June. As these reinforcements carry out their missions, the enemies of a free Iraq, including Al Qaida and illegal militias, will continue to bomb and murder in an attempt to stop us. We're going to expect heavy fighting in the weeks and months. We can expect more American and Iraqi casualties. We must provide our troops with the funds and resources they need to prevail.
Another important issue before Congress is immigration reform. I want to thank the bipartisan group of Senators who produced a bill that will help us secure our borders and reform our immigration system. For decades, the Government failed to stop illegal immigration. My administration has stepped up efforts to improve border security, doubling the number of Border Patrol agents. We've effectively ended the policy of catch-and-release, which allowed some illegal immigrants to be released back into society after they were captured. Last year alone, we apprehended more than a million people trying to enter this country illegally. This is progress, but it's not enough.
Many Americans are rightly skeptical about immigration reform. I strongly believe the bipartisan Senate bill addresses the reasons for past failures, while recognizing the legitimate needs of our economy and upholding the ideals of our immigrant tradition.
This bill does not grant amnesty. Amnesty is forgiveness without a penalty. Instead, this bill requires workers here illegally to acknowledge that they broke the law, pay a fine, pass background checks, remain employed, and maintain a clean record. This bill provides the best chance to reform our immigration system and help us make certain we know who's in our country and where they are.
Our immigration problems cannot be solved piecemeal. They must be all addressed together, and they must be addressed in logical order. So this legislation requires that border security and worker-verification targets are met before other provisions of the bill are triggered. For example, the temporary-worker program can begin only after these security measures are fully implemented. Immigration reform is a complex issue; it's a difficult piece of legislation. And those who are looking to find fault with this bill will always be able to find something. But if you're serious about securing our borders and bringing millions of illegal immigrants in our country out of the shadows, this bipartisan bill is the best opportunity to move forward. I'm confident, with hard work and good will, Congress can pass and I can sign a bill that fixes an immigration system we all agree is broken.
The issues of war and immigration are difficult, but that's no excuse in avoiding our responsibility to act. The American people sent us to Washington to take on tough problems, and they expect us to deliver results.
And now I'll be glad to answer some of your questions.

Iran/Nuclear Weapons Nonproliferation Efforts
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. The IAEA says that Iran has significantly accelerated its uranium enrichment program. And today President Ahmadi-nejad said that he would go ahead; he vowed to go ahead. There also is the detention of three Iranian Americans. Where is this all headed? And do you think it's time for tough U.N. sanctions with real teeth, and are you confident that Russia and China would go ahead?
The President. As you know, we have been discussing this issue a lot at these press avails. Iran is constantly on the agenda at a press avail like this—or a press conference like this, and the reason why is, is because they continue to be defiant as to the demands of the free world. The world has spoken and said, no nuclear weapons programs. And yet they're constantly ignoring the demands.
My view is that we need to strengthen our sanction regime. I just spoke to Condoleezza Rice, and we will work with our European partners to develop further sanctions. And, of course, I will discuss this issue with Vladimir Putin as well as President Hu Jintao.
The first thing that these leaders have got to understand is that an Iran with a nuclear weapon would be incredibly destabilizing for the world. It's in their interests that we work collaboratively to continue to isolate that regime.
I'm sympathetic for the people of Iran. I'm sorry they live under a Government that continues to insist upon a program that the world has condemned, because it is denying the good people of Iran economic opportunities that they would have. This is a country with a great tradition and a great history. There are hard-working people in that country that want to benefit from a society that is more open, and yet the Government insists upon measures that will lead to further isolation. And therefore, to answer your—one part of your question, we will work with our partners to continue the pressure.
Secondly, obviously, to the extent that these people are picking up innocent Americans, it's unacceptable. And we've made it very clear to the Iranian Government that the detention of good, decent American souls who are there to be beneficial citizens is not acceptable behavior.

U.S. Soldiers Missing in Iraq/Military Operations in Iraq
Q. Mr. President, dozens of American troops have been killed this month, and sectarian violence appears to be rising again in Iraq. And you yourself just said that you're expecting more casualties in the weeks and months ahead. How much longer do you believe you can sustain your current policy in Iraq without significant progress on the ground? And how confident are you about finding those missing soldiers?
The President. I'm confident that the military is doing everything it can to find the missing soldiers. I talked to General Petraeus about this subject and Secretary Gates. And General Petraeus informs him that we're using all the intelligence and all the troops we can find—to find them. It's a top priority of our people there in Iraq.
Obviously, the loss of life is—it is devastating to families. I fully understand that. But I want to remind you as to why I sent more troops in. It was to help stabilize the capital. You're asking me, ""How much longer?"" We have yet to even get all our troops in place. General David Petraeus laid out a plan for the Congress. He talked about a strategy all aiming—all aimed at helping this Iraqi Government secure its capital so that they can do the—some of the political work necessary, the hard work necessary to reconcile.
And as I explained in my opening remarks, all the troops won't be there until mid-June. And one reason you're seeing more fighting is because our troops are going into new areas, along with the Iraqis. And so General Petraeus has said, ""Why don't you give us until September, and let me report back,"" to not only me but to the United States Congress, ""about progress?""
I would like to see us in a different configuration at some point in time in Iraq. However, it's going to require taking control of the capital. And the best way to do that was to follow the recommendations of General Petraeus. As I have constantly made clear, the recommendations of Baker-Hamilton appeal to me, and that is to be embedded and to train and to guard the territorial integrity of the country and to have Special Forces to chase down Al Qaida. But I didn't think we could get there unless we increased the troop levels to secure the capital. I was fearful that violence would spiral out of control in Iraq and that this experience of trying to help this democracy would—couldn't succeed.
And so therefore, the decisions I made are all aimed at getting us to a different position; and the timing of which will be decided by the commanders on the ground, not politicians here in Washington.
Chen [Edwin Chen, Los Angeles Times]. Ed, excuse me. That's Henry [Ed Henry, Cable News Network]. Chen. Yes, you're coming down there; no, sorry. Work the print people a little bit, see. I've got the strategy: print. Ed, sorry.
Trade With China
Q. Good morning, Mr. President. A lot of lawmakers in Congress are saying that China has not done enough to allow its currency to appreciate, and they're talking about things like duties. What is your view about that, and are you prepared to do more to encourage the appreciation of the yuan?
The President. Thanks, Ed. I spoke to Madam Wu Yi today, as a matter of fact, had her into the Oval Office, wanted to thank her for bringing her delegation in and also to ask her to pass on a message to Hu Jintao that I appreciate his willingness to work in a strategic—with strategic dialogs in order to put in place the type of measures that reflect a complex relationship, in other words, the ability to discuss issues such as beef or intellectual property rights.
And one of the issues that I emphasized to Madam Wu Yi, as well as the delegation, was, was that we're watching very carefully as to whether or not they will appreciate their currency. And that's all in the context of making it clear to China that we value our relationship, but the $233 billion trade deficit must be addressed. And one way to address it is through currency evaluations.
Another way to address it is for them to help convert their economy from one of savers to consumers. And that's why Secretary Paulson worked very assiduously with this strategic dialog group to encourage openness for capital markets; that China must open its capital markets to allow for different financial institutions from around the world to go into the country. It not only will be beneficial to the United States, but we happen to think it will be beneficial to the Chinese economy, for the consumers to have different options when it comes to savings and purchases.
And so this is a important dialog, and it's one that I thank the Chinese Government for engaging in. And there's been some progress. Yesterday they opened new air routes. That's beneficial for U.S. airlines. It also happens to be beneficial for China, as far I am concerned. It's beneficial for that country to open up its access to more travelers, whether they be business or tourists.
Anyway, this is a complex relationship. And there's a lot of areas where we're working together, and there's areas where there's friction. And we've just got to work through the friction. One area where I've been disappointed is beef. They need to be eating U.S. beef. It's good for them. They'll like it. And so we're working hard to get that beef market opened up.
Ed.
War on Terror
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. A new Senate report this morning contends that your administration was warned before the war that by invading Iraq, you would actually give Iran and Al Qaida a golden opportunity to expand their influence, the kind of influence you were talking about with Al Qaida yesterday and with Iran this morning. Why did you ignore those warnings, sir?
The President. Ed, going into Iraq, we were warned about a lot of things, some of which happened, some of which didn't happen. And obviously, as I made a decision of—as consequential as that, I weighed the risks and rewards of any decision. I firmly believe the world is better off without Saddam Hussein in power. I know the Iraqis are better off without Saddam Hussein in power. I think America is safer without Saddam Hussein in power.
As to Al Qaida in Iraq, Al Qaida is going to fight us wherever we are. See, that's their strategy. Their strategy is to drive us out of the Middle East. They have made it abundantly clear what they want. They want to establish a caliphate. They want to spread their ideology. And they want safe haven from which to launch attacks. They're willing to kill the innocent to achieve their objectives, and they will fight us. And the fundamental question is, will we fight them? I have made the decision to do so. I believe that the best way to protect us in this war on terror is to fight them.
And so we're fighting them in Iraq; we're fighting them in Afghanistan; we've helped the Philippines fight—Philippine Government fight them. We're fighting them. And this notion about how this isn't a war on terror, in my view, is naive. It doesn't reflect the true nature of the world in which we live.
You know, the lessons of September the 11th are these: We've got to stay on the offense; we've got to bring these people to justice before they hurt again; and, at the same time, defeat their ideology with a ideology based upon liberty. And that's what you're seeing, and they're resisting it.
I think it ought to be illustrative to the American people that Al Qaida is trying to stop new democracies from evolving. And what does—what should that tell you? That ought to tell you that we're dealing with people that have an ideology that is opposite of liberty and will take whatever measures are necessary to prevent this young democracy from succeeding.
The danger in this particular theater in the war on terror is that if we were to fail, they'd come and get us. And, you know, I look at these reports right here in the Oval Office. For people who say that we're not under threat, they just simply do not know the world. We are under threat. And it's in our interest to pursue this enemy.
Martha [Martha Raddatz, ABC News].
Government of Iraq/U.S. Armed Forces in Iraq
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You say you want nothing short of victory, that leaving Iraq would be catastrophic. You once again mentioned Al Qaida. Does that mean that you are willing to leave American troops there, no matter what the Iraqi Government does? I know this is a question we've asked before, but you can begin it with a yes or no.
The President. We are there at the invitation of the Iraqi Government. This is a sovereign nation. Twelve million people went to the polls to approve a Constitution. It's their Government's choice. If they were to say, ""Leave,"" we would leave.
Q. [Inaudible]—results would be catastrophic, as you've said over and over again?
The President. I would hope that they would recognize that the results would be catastrophic. But this is a sovereign nation, Martha. We are there at their request. And hopefully, the Iraqi Government would be wise enough to recognize that without coalition troops, particularly U.S. troops, that they would endanger their very existence. And it's why we work very closely with them, to make sure that the realities are such that they wouldn't make that request. But if they were to make the request, we wouldn't be there.

War on Terror/Threat of Further Terrorist Attacks
Q. Mr. President, after the mistakes that have been made in this war, when you do as you did yesterday, where you raised 2-year-old intelligence, talking about the threat posed by Al Qaida, it's met with increasing skepticism. The majority in the public, a growing number of Republicans appear not to trust you any longer to be able to carry out this policy successfully. Can you explain why you believe you're still a credible messenger on the war?
The President. I'm credible because I read the intelligence, David, and make it abundantly clear in plain terms that if we let up, we'll be attacked. And I firmly believe that.
Look, this has been a long, difficult experience for the American people. I can assure you, Al Qaida, who would like to attack us again, have got plenty of patience and persistence. And the question is, will we?
Yes, I talked about intelligence yesterday. I wanted to make sure the intelligence I laid out was credible, so we took our time. Somebody said, well, he's trying to politicize the thing. If I was trying to politicize it, I'd have dropped it out before the 2006 elections. I believe I have an obligation to tell the truth to the American people as to the nature of the enemy. And it's unpleasant for some. I fully recognize that after 9/11, in the calm here at home, relatively speaking, caused some to say, well, maybe we're not at war. I know that's a comfortable position to be in, but that's not the truth.
Failure in Iraq will cause generations to suffer, in my judgment. Al Qaida will be emboldened. They will say, yes, once again, we've driven the great, soft America out of a part of the region. It will cause them to be able to recruit more. It will give them safe haven. They are a direct threat to the United States.
And I'm going to keep talking about it. That's my job as the President, is to tell people the threats we face and what we're doing about it. And what we've done about it is, we've strengthened our homeland defenses. We've got new techniques that we use that enable us to better determine their in—their motives and their plans and plots. We're working with nations around the world to deal with these radicals and extremists. But they're dangerous, and I can't put it any more plainly: They're dangerous. And we will, and I can't put it any more plainly to the American people and to them: We will stay on the offense.
It's better to fight them there than here. And this concept about, well, maybe let us kind of just leave them alone, and maybe they'll be all right is naive. These people attacked us before we were in Iraq. They viciously attacked us before we were in Iraq, and they've been attacking ever since. They are a threat to your children, David, and whoever is in that Oval Office better understand it and take measures necessary to protect the American people.
Q. So what about—[inaudible].
The President. Axelrod [Jim Axelrod, CBS News].
U.S. Armed Forces in Iraq
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to ask you about the Petraeus report, which, as you say, will be in September and report on progress. Doesn't setting up the September date give the enemy exactly what you've said you don't want them to have, which is a date to focus on, and doesn't it guarantee a bloody August?
And while I have you, sir, the phrase you just used, ""a different configuration in Iraq"" that you'd like to see, is that a plan B?
The President. Well, see, actually, I would call that a plan recommended by Baker-Hamilton, so that would be a plan B-H. I've stated—you didn't like it? [Laughter] Okay.
I've stated, this is an idea that—I like the concept. The question is, could we get there given the violence last fall? And the answer, in my judgment, was, no, we would never be able to configure our troops that way, in that configuration—place our troops in that configuration given the violence inside the capital city.
David Petraeus felt like that it was important to tell the White House and tell the Congress that he would come back with an assessment in September. It's his decision to give the assessment, and I respect him, and I support him.
Q. Doesn't it give the terrorists a——
The President. It does, precisely. It's going to make—it could make August a tough month, because you see, what they're going to try to do is kill as many innocent people as they can to try to influence the debate here at home. Don't you find that interesting? I do—that they recognize that the death of innocent people could shake our will, could undermine David Petraeus's attempt to create a more stable Government. They will do anything they can to prevent success. And the reason why is, Al Qaida fully understands that if we retreat, they then are able to have another safe haven, in their mind.
Yesterday, in my speech, I quoted quotes from Usama bin Laden. And the reason I did was—is that I want the American people to hear what he has to say—not what I say, what he says. And in my judgment, we ought to be taking the words of the enemy seriously.
And so yes, it could be a bloody—it could be a very difficult August. And I fully understand——
Q. [Inaudible]—fighting the Democrats on that in the Senate about a date——
The President. Yes, David Petraeus, the commander—look, do you want politicians making those decisions, or do you want commanders on the ground making the decisions? My point is, is that I would trust David Petraeus to make an assessment and a recommendation a lot better than people in the United States Congress. And that's precisely the difference.
Michael [Michael Abramowitz, Washington Post].
Justice Department/Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales
Q. Good morning, Mr. President. I'd like to ask you about the Justice Department. In the last couple months, we have heard disturbing evidence about senior officials of the Justice Department misleading Congress. We heard disturbing evidence yesterday that a senior official at Justice Department improperly took, by her own admission, political considerations into effect in evaluating career employees of the Justice Department.
We've also had evidence from the former Deputy Attorney General of the White House strong-arming a sick man into trying to approve an illegal spying program. I'm curious, Mr. President, if you are concerned about the cumulative picture that's being drawn about your Justice Department? And what assurances can you give the American people that the Department is delivering impartial justice to the American people?
The President. Yes, thank you, Michael. There is a—an internal investigation taking place at the Justice Department. And this will be an exhaustive investigation. And if there's wrongdoing, it will be taken care of.
I thought it was interesting how you started your question, ""Over the months."" I think you said, ""Over the last months."" This investigation is taking a long time; in fact, kind of being drug out. I suspect for political question—for political reasons. In other words, as I mentioned the other day, it's just grand political theater.
If—Attorney General Gonzales has testified. He's produced documents. And I would hope the Senate and the Congress would move expeditiously to finish their hearings and get on to the business of passing legislation that is meaningful for the country. But if there had been wrongdoing, that will be addressed, the way we'd hope it would be.
Q. [Inaudible]—confidence. Are you——
The President. Yes, I've got confidence in Al Gonzales doing the job. Bret [Bret Baier, FOX News].
War on Terror/Progress in Iraq
Q. Mr. President, are you surprised by reports today from the Iraqis that sectarian killings are actually on the rise to pre-troop surge levels? And, if I may, yesterday after your speech, Senator Joe Biden said Al Qaida in Iraq is a ""Bush-fulfilling prophecy."" They weren't there before; now they're there. He said U.S. troops should get out of the middle of a civil war and fight Al Qaida.
The President. Yes.
Q. Can you respond to that?
The President. We are fighting Al Qaida in Iraq. A lot of the spectaculars you're seeing are caused by Al Qaida. Al Qaida will fight us wherever we are. That's what they do. That's what they've said they want to do. They have objectives. These are ideologues driven by a vision of the world that we must defeat. And you defeat them on the one hand by hunting them down and bringing them to justice, and you defeat them on the other hand by offering a different alternative form of government.
The Middle East looked nice and cozy for a while. Everything looked fine on the surface, but beneath the surface, there was a lot of resentment; there was a lot of frustration, such that 19 kids got on airplanes and killed 3,000 Americans. It's in the long-term interest of this country to address the root causes of these extremists and radicals exploiting people that cause them to kill themselves and kill Americans and others.
I happen to believe one way to do that is to address the forms of government under which people live. Democracy is really difficult work, but democracy has proven to help change parts of the world from cauldrons of frustration to areas of hope. And we will continue to pursue this foreign policy; it's in our national interest we do so.
What other aspect of the question?
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. Yes, I'm—there's—certainly, there's been an uptick in violence. It's a snapshot; it's a moment. And David Petraeus will come back with his assessment, after his plan has been fully implemented, and give us a report as to what he recommends—what he sees, and what he recommends, which is, I think, a lot more credible than what Members of Congress recommend. We want our commanders making the recommendations, and—along with Ryan Crocker, our Ambassador there—I don't want to leave Ryan out.
And so it's a—you know, to Axelrod's point, it's a—no question it's the kind of report that the enemy would like to affect because they want us to leave. They want us out of there. And the reason they want us to leave is because they have objectives that they want to accomplish. Al Qaida— David Petraeus called Al Qaida public enemy number one in Iraq. I agree with him. And Al Qaida is public enemy number one in America. It seems like to me that if they're public enemy number one here, we want to help defeat them in Iraq.
This is a tough fight, you know? And it's—obviously, it's had an effect on the American people. Americans—a lot of Americans want to know win—when are you going to win? And victory is—victory will come when that country is stable enough to be able to be an ally in the war on terror and to govern itself and defend itself.
One of the things that appealed to me about the Baker-Hamilton is that it will provide a—kind of a long-term basis for that likely to happen, assuming the Iraqi Government invites us to stay there. The— and I believe this is an area where we can find common ground with Democrats and Republicans, by the way. I fully recognize there are a group of Democrats who say: ""Get out of the deal now. It's just not worth it.""
One of the areas where I really believe we need more of a national discussion, however, is, what would be the consequences of failure in Iraq? See, people have got to understand that if that government were to fall, the people would tend to divide into kind of sectarian enclaves, much more so than today, that would invite Iranian influence and would invite Al Qaida influence, much more so than in Iraq today. That would then create enormous turmoil—or could end up creating enormous turmoil in the Middle East, which would have a direct effect on the security of the United States.
Failure in Iraq affects the security of this country. And it's hard for some Americans to see that. I fully understand it; I see it clearly. I believe this is the great challenge of the beginning of the 21st century—not just Iraq, but dealing with this radical, ideological movement in a way that secures us in the short term and more likely secures us in the long term.
Jim [Jim Rutenberg, New York Times]. You didn't nod off there, did you? [Laughter] A little hot out here in the Rose Garden for you? [Laughter]
Usama bin Laden/Threat of Further Terrorist Attacks
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Yes, well, go ahead and take the tie off. I'm halfway done anyway. [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President, yesterday you discussed Usama bin Laden's plans to turn Iraq into a terrorist sanctuary. What do you think your own reaction would have been 5 years ago had you been told that towards the end of your term, he would still be at large with that kind of capability, from Iraq, no less, and why—can you tell the American people—is he still on the run? Why is he so hard to catch?
The President. I would say that 5 years ago—like I said, we're going to pursue him. And we are pursuing him. And he's hiding. He is in a remote region of the world. If I knew precisely where he is, we would take the appropriate action to bring him to justice. He is attempting to establish a base of operatio","ns in Iraq. He hasn't established a base in operations. My points yesterday were, here was his intentions, but thankfully, of the three people I named, all of them no longer are a part of his operation.
My point is, is that—I was making the point, Jim, as I'm sure you recognized, that if we leave, they follow us. And my point was, was that Usama bin Laden was establishing an external cell there, or trying to. And he's been unable to do it, precisely my point. That's why we've got to stay engaged. Had he been able to establish an internal cell that had safe haven, we would be a lot more in danger today than we are. His organization is a risk. We will continue to pursue as hard as we possibly can. We will do everything we can to bring him and others to justice.
We have had good success in the chief operating officer position of Al Qaida. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Ramzi al Rabium—there's a lot of names that I— some of whom I mentioned yesterday, that are no longer a threat to the United States. We will continue to work to bring him to justice; that's exactly what the American people expect us to do, and, in the meantime, use the tools we put in place to protect this homeland.
We are under threat. Now, some may say, well, he's just saying that to get people to pay attention to him, or try to scare them into—for some reason. I would hope our world hadn't become so cynical that they don't take the threats of Al Qaida seriously, because they're real. And it's a danger to the American people. It's a danger to your children, Jim. And it's really important that we do all we can do to bring them to justice.
Q. Mr. President, why is he still at large?
The President. Why is he at large? Because we haven't got him yet, Jim, that's why. And he's hiding, and we're looking, and we will continue to look until we bring him to justice. We've brought a lot of his buddies to justice, but not him. That's why he's still at large. He's not out there traipsing around. He's not leading many parades, however. He's not out feeding the hungry. He's isolated, trying to kill people to achieve his objective.
Those are his words—his objectives are his words, not mine. He has made it clear; he and Zawahiri, their number two, have made it clear what they want. And in a war against extremists and radicals like these, we ought to be listening carefully to what they say. We ought to take their words seriously. There have been moments in history where others haven't taken the words of people seriously, and they suffered. So I'm taking them seriously.
Yes, Jim [Jim Gerstenzang, Los Angeles Times].
Former President Saddam Hussein of Iraq
Q. Mr. President, moments ago you said that Al Qaida attacked us before we were in Iraq. Since then Iraq has become much less stable; Al Qaida has used it as a recruiting tool, apparently with some success. So what would you say to those who would argue that what we've done in Iraq has simply enhanced Al Qaida and made the situation worse?
The President. Oh, so, in other words, the option would have been, just let Sad-dam Hussein stay there? That's—your question is, should we not have left Saddam Hussein in power? And the answer is, absolutely not. Saddam Hussein was an enemy of the United States. He'd attacked his neighbors. He was paying Palestinian suicide bombers. He would have been—if he were to defy—and by the way, cheating on the U.N. oil for sanctions program— Oil-for-Food Programme. No, I don't buy it. I don't buy that this world would be a better place with Saddam Hussein in power, and particularly if—and I'm sure the Iraqis would agree with that.
See, that's the kind of attitude—he says, okay, let's let them live under a tyrant, and I just don't agree. I obviously thought he had weapons; he didn't have weapons. The world thought he had weapons. It was a surprise to me that he didn't have the weapons of mass destruction that everybody thought he had, but he had the capacity at some point in time to make weapons. It would have been a really dangerous world if we had the Iranians trying to develop a nuclear weapon, and Saddam Hussein competing for a nuclear weapon. You can imagine what the mentality of the Middle East would have been like.
And so the heart of your question is, shouldn't you have left Saddam Hussein in power? And the answer is ""No."" And now that we've——
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. ——well, that's really the crux of it. And—let me finish, please, here. I'm on a roll here. And so now that we have, does it make sense to help this young democracy survive? And the answer is ""Yes,"" for a variety of reasons.
One, we want to make sure that this enemy that did attack us doesn't establish a safe haven from which to attack again. Two, the ultimate success in a war against ideologues is to offer a different ideology, one based upon liberty, by the way, embraced by 12 million people when given the chance. Thirdly, our credibility is at stake in the Middle East. There's a lot of Middle Eastern nations wondering whether the United States of America is willing to push back against radicals and extremists, no matter what their religion base—religious bases may be.
And so the stakes are high in Iraq. I believe they're absolutely necessary for the security of this country. The consequences of failure are immense.
Yes.
Q. So there was no choice between the course we took and leaving Saddam Hussein in power? No—nothing else that might have worked?
The President. Well, we tried other things. As you might remember back then, we tried the diplomatic route: 1441 was a unanimous vote in the Security Council that said disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences. So the choice was his to make. And he made a choice that has subsequently left—subsequently caused him to lose his life under a system that he wouldn't have given his own citizens. Now, we tried diplomacy. As a matter of fact, not only did I try diplomacy; other Presidents tried diplomacy.
Let's see here. John [John McKinnon, Wall Street Journal].
Legislative Priorities/Immigration Reform
Q. Thanks, Mr. President. You've said many times that you plan to sprint to the finish of your Presidency. At this point in the home stretch, what can you say you're still expecting to accomplish? And how concerned are you that the immigration bill in particular is going to get caught up in electoral politics?
The President. Yes, thanks. Well, we need to pass additional energy legislation. We need to renew No Child Left Behind. Get these trade bills out of Congress—the trade bills on Panama and Peru and Colombia, hopefully, work toward a free trade— further the work we've done on the Korean free trade agreement. Hopefully, I'll be able to bring back successful negotiations on Doha for a congressional vote which will require a TPA extension and/or—a TPA extension, there's no ""and/or"" to it. Making sure that this progress on balancing the budget continues. The deficit is—I know you're following the numbers, John— the deficit is reduced more than anticipated as a result of increased tax revenues coming in and the fiscal measures that we took. And now we're going to have to work with Congress to make sure they don't overspend and make sure they don't raise the taxes on the people as well.
Running up the taxes will hurt this economy, which would hurt the revenues to the Treasury. I'm deeply concerned about the Democratic budget that is classic tax and spend. I'm looking forward to seeing how they intend to keep their promise of balancing this budget in 5 years.
A big—and of course, fighting this war on terror is a huge issue. I obviously would like to find common ground on how to proceed in Iraq, with Democrats and Republicans. I recognize there are a handful there or some who just say, ""Get out, it's just not worth it, let's just leave."" I strongly disagree with that attitude; most Americans do as well. And the vote showed that what's possible when we work together, the vote— the pending vote today showed what's possible when we work together, when Republicans and Democrats work together. There's a good group of Republicans that want to work with Democrats. They just don't want to accept something that they don't agree with.
Immigration, this is a tough issue. This is a very emotional, hard issue for members of both parties. I've always been a believer that comprehensive immigration reform is the best way to secure our border. I campaigned on that for President twice. I believed it when I was the Governor of Texas. I understand this issue very well. I also understand the frustrations of many citizens in that they believe the government hasn't done its job of stopping illegal migrants from coming into the country.
And that's why over the past couple of years there's been a significant effort to secure the border. There's going to be a doubling of the Border Patrol agents; there's going to be fencing and berms and different types of equipment to help the Border Patrol do its job in a better way. As a matter of fact, I was concerned about it enough to ask the National Guard to go down there for a while.
And—but, John, I don't see—and so those concerns, by the way, are addressed in this bill. The bill essentially says that before any other reforms take place, certain benchmarks will be met when it comes to securing the border. Last year, during the debate, people said, well, let's have security first. That's exactly what the bill does.
However, I don't see how you can have the border security the American people expect unless you have a temporary-worker program, with a verifiable work card. People will come here to do work to feed their families, and they'll figure out ways to do so. As a result of people wanting to come here to do work to feed their families, there is an underground industry that has sprung up that I think is essentially antihumanitarian. It is an industry based upon coyotes; those are smugglers. Good, hard-working, decent people pay pretty-good-size money to be smuggled into the United States of America.
There is a document forgery industry in America. There are people who are willing to stuff people inside temporary shelter in order for them to evade the law. I don't think this is American. I think the whole industry that exploits the human being is not in our Nation's interests. And the best way to deal with this problem is to say, if you're going to come and do jobs Americans aren't doing, here is a opportunity to do so, on a temporary basis. I would much rather have people crossing the border with a legitimate card, coming to work on a temporary basis, than being stuffed in the back of an 18-wheeler. And I would hope most Americans feel that as well.
Secondly, in order for there to be good employer verification—it's against the law to hire somebody who is here illegally, but many times small businesses or large are presented with documents, and they don't know whether they're real or not. And so therefore, we must have a tamper-proof identification card, which is a part of this bill.
A tough issue, of course, is what do you do with the people already here? Anything short of kicking them out, as far as some people are concerned, is called amnesty. You can't kick them out. Anybody who advocates trying to dig out 12 million people who have been in our society for a while is sending a signal to the American people that's just not real. It's an impractical solution. Nor do I think they ought to be given automatic citizenship; that is amnesty— okay, you're here illegally, therefore, you're automatically a citizen.
And so therefore, we proposed and worked with the Senate to devise a plan that said, if you're here already before a certain date, that there are certain hurdles you must cross in order to receive what's called a Z visa, in order to be able to work here. You've got to go through a background check; you've got to pay a fine at some point in time; there's a probationary period. And there's a series of steps that people have to go through, and then people get at the back of the line—the citizenship line—not the beginning of the citizenship line.
If you're for the bill, I thank you; if you're against it, you can find every reason in the world to be against a comprehensive bill. It's easy to find something to be against in this bill. All it takes is to take one little aspect of it and ignore the comprehensive nature and how good it is.
I knew this was going to be an explosive issue. It's easy to hold up somebody who is here and working hard as a political target. I would like to get this bill done for a lot of reasons. I'd like to get it done because it's the right thing to do. I'd like to get it done because I happen to believe the approach that is now being discussed in the Senate is an approach that will actually solve the problem. I'd like to get it out of politics. I don't think it's good to be, you know, holding people up. We've been through immigration debates in this country, and they can bring out the worst, sometimes, in people. We're a land of immigrants.
I was touched yesterday when the kid from the Coast Guard Academy—ensign, now ensign—talked about his migrant grandfather from Mexico. And here's this guy—this man standing up in front of the President of the United States and his class, talking about serving America. He wasn't— you know, his grandfather wasn't born here. I don't know what job he did; I suspect it was probably manual labor. I don't know; I didn't ask him.
But I do know he spoke with pride. I do know he represents the best about what immigration can mean for America. You know, welcoming people here who want to work and realize the American Dream renews our spirit and soul. It's been the case throughout generations. And we have an opportunity to put a good law in place now; right now. And it's going to be hard work. And sure, politics will get involved. But the question is, will Members of Congress rise above politics? I will. It's the right thing to have a comprehensive bill.
And so I'm going to continue to reach out to Members of Congress from both parties and call upon them to take the lead and show the political courage necessary to get the bill to my desk as quickly as possible.
I want to thank you for your interest."
"June 09, 2007",The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Romano Prodi of Italy in Rome,George W. Bush,"George W. Bush, The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Romano Prodi of Italy in Rome Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/276214",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-romano-prodi-italy-rome,"Prime Minister Prodi. Good afternoon, everyone. I am delighted to have received President Bush today, and I thank President Bush for having chosen to spend a couple of days in Rome for his European mission, a rather long European mission, I would say. And this is the first in his second term.
Our talks today have been very, very interesting, indeed, very friendly talks. And I must say that we took the opportunity, in fact, to pursue some issues that we already began discussing in Heiligendamm. And, in fact, we had a bilateral meeting today and discussed some of the issues, as I said, that we already went over in Germany.
We talked about climate change, energy, our fight against poverty, our Africa policies. These are all very, very important decisions and choices that we have to make and, of course, that are going to be important for the future, the next generation as well.
We briefly went over some bilateral issues. Fortunately, we don't have any bilateral problems—I would say—no serious problems that have created any divisions between our two countries. And in particular, in fact, we do share the same views with regard to many issues, many matters. And we basically agree on how the future of the world should look, should be.
Now, I thanked President Bush for some symbolic gestures that he has shown. Our countries are becoming closer and closer. And, in fact, Italian, the Italian language is one of the language that can be freely chosen in American schools. All high schools in America offer Italian as a language of study. And I think that this is a wonderful step, a wonderful way to bring two countries closer, especially when we consider that the flow of immigration between our two countries has stopped; it stopped a long time ago.
Now, going on to other issues, of course, we agree that we need some new major players, new major world players, and we have to, in fact, work together with China, India, Brazil, Mexico. And we agree on that approach.
We also talked about some meetings that we had with Mr. Lula and President Hu Jintao after the end of the G-8 summit. And we realize, as I've said, that we've got to work more and more together. And I think that the progress that has been made by the United States in reaching an agreement, a broad agreement on climate change has been a wonderful step forward, and I think that this is taking us in the right direction. In other words, we have to work together on these issues.
We haven't yet finalized some of the quantitative details of this agreement, but obviously, the underlying message is to work together, to cooperate. And I would say that maybe just a few months ago that seemed to be unlikely.
Now, we also had a good discussion on other issues of common concern. We talked about Kosovo, for example, Lebanon, Afghanistan, and we spoke about some responsibilities that we should take on together. So both our countries should work together in order to restore peace and stability in these different areas of the world.
We need to do more. We need to keep working together, especially when it comes to Middle Eastern issues. We know, of course, that we have not yet been able to put an end to the crisis which has been ongoing now for a number of years. And in Lebanon, in fact, the peace mission has certainly led to some positive outcomes; yet, there are still tensions; there are still many difficulties. And that's an open-ended issue, therefore, that we have to continue being concerned about.
Now, that's what we discussed today. I don't wish to add any further remarks. I would like to give the floor right over to President Bush. And I thank you so very much for having come today, and I thank you for making it possible to cooperate together and, of course, for enabling this cooperation with success in the future. Thank you.
President Bush. Buongiorno. Mr. Prime Minister, thank you. Laura and I are glad to be back in your beautiful country. Rome is a spectacular city. And I'm sorry we're disrupting traffic, but, nevertheless, it is great to be back here. Thank you for the wonderful meal, and thank you for our friendship. I think it's important for the people of your country to know, relations between our countries are strong, and we intend to keep them that way. And I appreciate that; I appreciate the good conversation we had.
I thank you for your commitment to the people of Afghanistan. Your country has been an integral part of the NATO mission. You provided a lot of important troops for NATO; you're involved with the PRTs in Afghanistan. I thank you, but no more so than the Afghan people thank the people of Italy. These people are desperate to live in a free society, and you ought to take great pride, Romano, and I know you do, in making a significant contribution to their freedom. I also appreciate your very—your strong advice in making sure that we all understand this is not just a military operation, that there has to be a political track and a reconstruction track in order for this democracy to survive. And so I'm looking forward to continuing to work on this important issue.
I thank you, as well, for your leadership in Lebanon. It was a year ago when we were at the G-8. You remember the attacks came on Israel, and then, all of a sudden, the situation began to look like it needed some help. And there was a lot of doubt in the world's mind until Italy stepped up and said: We will provide troops, and we'll be the military leader in Lebanon. And then the world followed. And I want to thank you for your leadership on that important issue.
And now we've just got to make sure the Siniora Government survives. One of the best ways to do so is to insist that we proceed forward with the Hariri trial, to make sure that there are consequences for behavior that may affect the stability of a democracy. I don't want to prejudge the outcome of the trial, but I do think it's an important measure for all of us to see the truth in that part of the world. And I know we can continue to work together. It's very important that foreign influences, like that of Syria, not be continually disrupting the Siniora Government.
I want to thank you very much for our discussions on Kosovo. This is a part of the world you know a lot about, and Romano made some very significant contributions during the roundtable discussions at the G-8 and was, again, very eloquent today about two things: One, that obviously, a deep concern about the Kosovars, their desire to be independent, coupled with making sure there is a avenue forward for Serbs through the EU and maybe NATO. And I appreciate your leading on this issue. It's important that the United States and Italy work together on common problems. After all, we share common values. And today's discussion just goes, at least, to show me how much we can do when we work in a collaborative way.
As Romano said, the bilateral relations are pretty darn solid. And I appreciate that. There's a lot of Italian Americans who have got great pride for their homeland. They're watching this press conference—well, they may not be watching all of it, Romano, but they'll be watching some of it, and they're going to want to know, are we doing well? And the answer is, we are. And I'm grateful.
Answer a couple of questions, or what do you think?
Prime Minister Prodi. Yes.
President Bush. Okay, yes.
Italy-U.S. Relations
Q. Mr. President, you just said that you had lunch with Prodi today. Then later you'll have a coffee break with Mr. Berlusconi. What do you enjoy most, the lunch or the coffee break? [Laughter] Or would you have preferred to be on a diet today? [Laughter]
And to Prime Minister Prodi, now, I'm perhaps not going to be so ironic in my question. Now the friendship is wonderful. You've made progress. But I know that there have been some differences between the U.S. and Italy over the months, even though the friendship is solid and progress has been made. So President Bush is asking you to perhaps change your rules of engagement in Afghanistan, and even with regard to Iran, there are some differences of opinion and, in general, in the Middle East. So have you managed to close that gap a bit? Or how do you think you might be doing that in the future?
President Bush. Yes, I'm going to have coffee with the former Prime Minister, Prime Minister Berlusconi. I'm doing so for a couple of reasons: One, he is the opposition leader; two, he is a friend. And I mentioned this to Romano, and his attitude was, I don't blame you; it's the kind of thing he does when he goes to other countries. And I'm looking forward to seeing Silvio. It's a—one shouldn't read anything into it, other than we made some decisions together. We've known each other for a while, just like I've known Romano— actually, I've known Romano a long time too. He was President of the EU early on in my Presidency. And so I consider it an honor to have friends with two important leaders here in Italy.
Prime Minister Prodi. We spoke very frankly about many of the issues that you've just raised in your question. And, yes, there certainly is an active cooperation between us. And this is with regard to problems we've had in Afghanistan and, of course, the very difficult situation in Iran. And we both share the same position, the same views when—with regard to the danger that we are running if we allow the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and we also agree on the course of action that should be followed.
So I think that in the future we'll certainly be able to work together, and we'll be able to exert pressure, both of us, on the Iranian Government. We don't want them to exceed the limits, as it were, of a peaceful and monitored or controlled use of nuclear technology. So, this is our position, and, as I said, we share the same view.
Now, of course, we also discussed other issues on our common agenda, and we were able to reiterate the fact that there is an interdependence here and a need to work together, not only because it is helpful or useful, but it is a strong need that we have to focus on to restore peace in the world.
Now, we spoke about climate change, about global warming in our meetings over the past few days. And I think that this has somehow set out a course of action for the future: how we can perhaps harmonize our production systems; how we can make sure that our political decisions are, in fact, in conformity with these needs. And I think, again, that we'll definitely be able to make huge progress together.
Pope Benedict XVI
Q. Thank you, sir. Can you talk about your conversation with Pope Benedict earlier? Did you have a fundamental disagreement over whether Iraq was a just war? And what of his concerns about Iraq did you take to heart?
And if I could, to the Prime Minister: What did you tell the President today about the trials going on here involving Americans?
President Bush. Jennifer [Jennifer Loven, Associated Press], I'll be glad to share some of the private conversation with His Holy Father. First, I'll give you an impression. I was talking to a very smart, loving man. And I—you know, after 61⁄2 years of being the President, I've seen some unusual— I've been to some unusual places, and I've met some interesting people. And I was in awe, and it was a moving experience for me.
We didn't talk about ""just war."" He did express deep concern about the Christians inside Iraq, that he was concerned that the society that was evolving would not tolerate the Christian religion. And I assured him we're working hard to make sure that they—people lived up to the Constitution, that modern Constitution voted on by the people that would honor people from different walks of life and different attitudes.
We talked about a lot of other subjects. We talked about our attempts to help the people in Africa deal with HIV/AIDS and malaria and hunger. I reminded him that we made a significant commitment to that end, that about 3 years ago, 50,000 people were getting antiretroviral drugs. Now over 1,100,000 people are getting them, as a result of our initiative on HIV/AIDS, and that I'm going to double that commitment—or ask Congress to double the commitment from 15 billion to 30 billion.
I talked to him about our malaria program, about how we intend to reduce malaria by 50 percent in certain countries, and that I'd continue to remind the world of our duty to work together to achieve a major goal, which is to try to eradicate malaria throughout Africa.
And I talked to him about our attempts to feed the hungry, and I also reminded him that we've got poor people in our own neighborhood that need to be affected.
He talked about immigration. He's watching the immigration debate very closely in America. And I told him I was a person who strongly supports comprehensive immigration reform that, on the one hand, we'll enforce our law; on the other hand, we need to treat people with dignity. And we had a good discussion.
Q. ——the Pope has said——
President Bush. What?
Q. The Pope has said Iraq was worrisome.
President Bush. Yes, he's worrisome about the Christians inside Iraq being mistreated by the Muslim majority. He's deeply concerned about that, and we spent a lot—spent a fair amount of time talking about it.
Prime Minister Prodi. We did not discuss the issue that you raised in your question just a moment ago. And I've already clarified many times that Italy, of course, is a democratic country. We have very clear-cut rules that we follow, and we, therefore, enforce our rules. And I am confident that there is no conflict here, in terms of our friendship and our cooperation with the United States.
Italy-U.S. Relations/Kosovo/G-8 Summit in Heiligendamm, Germany
Q. Thank you. You've just told us that you and President Bush have just returned from your G-8 summit. Now, the outcomes that have been stated on the many issues that you discussed—climate, development, and the missile shield—now, are those real—is that real progress, or not? And the deadline for the Kosovo independence——
President Bush. What? Say that again.
Q. Deadline for the Kosovo independence?
President Bush. A decline?
Q. Deadline, deadline.
President Bush. Oh, a deadline—beg your pardon. My English isn't very good. [Laughter]
Q. Sorry. And do you wish that President Prodi will pay a visit to you in Washington in the next months?
President Bush. Yes, and yes.
Q. What kind of deadline?
President Bush. I'd love to welcome the Prime Minister. And it—we're just going to have to work through our schedules, but he's invited any time. Listen, Italy is a great friend. There are millions of people in our country who love Italy because that's where their heritage is from. My Ambassador's grandfather was from Italy. I'm sure you know this, but the heritage, the Italian heritage, is a powerful part of our country and its culture. And the Prime Minister is welcome.
In terms of the deadline, there needs to be one. This needs to come; this needs to happen. Now it's time, in our judgment, to move the Ahtisaari plan. There was a— there's been a series of delays. You might remember: There was a moment when something was happening, and they said, no, we need a little more time to try to work through a U.N. Security Council resolution. And our view is that time is up.
And so we're working with our friends and allies, and I had a long discussion with Vladimir Putin on the subject. To share with you my thoughts, what I told him there at the table was, ""It's time, it's time to bring this issue to a head."" And obviously, there's deep concern about what that would mean, whether he'd accept it, or not. I understand that. But the Kosovars are eagerly anticipating a decision by the world.
And at the same time, Romano is right, we need to make sure that the Serbs see a way forward. And one good way forward is through, potentially, EU membership. I don't have that much to say in it, but I can talk to the Serbs about economic development and can talk about a better relationship with the United States. And therefore, we will.
Prime Minister Prodi. Going back to the summit, I can say that it has been an actual success, real progress, in other words. I mean, just think; people were expecting a rift, problems, arguments, and, instead, we did reach some important conclusions. Now, even the issue of global warming, for example, we realize that there is a predominant, a prevalent principle, and that is that global issues have to be dealt with globally. In fact, we all talk about the Kyoto Protocol, for example, and we said that this was the first step towards international cooperation in this field, in this sector.
Now, again, we still have some technicalities to work out; some little pieces there are missing, as it were. But definitely there is a clear-cut will to move forward. We have a resolve there; India, China, Brazil, Mexico, everyone has shown the same resolve. There were other countries in addition to these; even though they're not G- 8 members, they're all there to work on global solutions because this is the only way we can possibly reach some kind of equilibrium in the future.
Now, with regard to the other issues— Kosovo, for example, and our relations with Russia—well, I would say that during our meeting, there was a certain ambiance. We talked about interdependence. I think that's a good way of putting it. We didn't feel any tensions, but rather we were all seeking this—a way to strengthen our interdependence. And I think that this is something that should be guiding us in our relations with Russia, and this is how we can build up a peaceful system for the future.
Those are the goals of the G-8. In fact, G-8 summits don't always have technical agendas that are predefined, predetermined. That's not how it works. We need to meet and to freely discuss some of these long-term issues. So we were able to do that very freely, very openly. And I must say that we all agreed on our future course of action, and I think that we couldn't have hoped for any better than that.
Now, with regard to Kosovo, again, now we know how to move forward, after our discussions there. And I think that that, basically, I mean, we couldn't have hoped for any better outcome than that there.
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Q. Thank you, sir. Mr. President: General Pace, an Italian American—Pace, as you know, is leaving—a distinguished marine, with a lengthy career, somebody that all indications are, you and Secretary Gates enjoyed working with a great deal—is on his way out. And I wonder what this says about the political climate in Washington, that it was decided that maybe it would be better to have a new Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, rather than have a bruising battle on Capitol Hill.
President Bush. Yes. Pete Pace is a fine man and a great general. And I think the fact that Secretary Gates made the recommendation not to move forward with a renomination speaks to the U.S. Congress and the climate in the U.S. Congress.
Pete Pace always gave me candid advice. Pete Pace is an excellent strategic thinker. And the interesting thing about Pete Pace, even though he had four stars on his shoulder, always talked about the private. He speculated out loud about Private Pace: What would Private Pace think of this decision? What would Private Pace's families think about a decision that he was recommending to me?
And so the decision has been made, and I'm going to miss him. And the country owes him a great debt of gratitude for years of service, first at Vice Chairman and then as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Thank you all.
Prime Minister Prodi. Thank you.
President Bush. Thank you. Thank you for that ovation. They must have been yelling, ""Brilliant answer."""
"August 21, 2007","The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada and President Felipe de Jesus Calderon Hinojosa of Mexico in Montebello, Canada",George W. Bush,"George W. Bush, The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada and President Felipe de Jesus Calderon Hinojosa of Mexico in Montebello, Canada Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/276324",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-stephen-harper-canada-and-president,"Prime Minister Harper. Might I, first and foremost, thank all the people here and the citizens of Montebello for giving such a warm Quebec welcome. You are quite right to be proud of your beautiful Montebello manoir and the area.
As the leaders of the three countries, between—and our discussions between President Bush and myself were very cordial, constructive. Our three countries maintain peaceful, productive relations and give great contributions to our people. It is part and parcel of our commitment to democracy, free market, NAFTA, and the equality of chances to all citizens.
This is a unique moment to look at the individual aspects that we could look at and the challenges that we have to face. We agreed to discuss the protection of the consumer and looking at the nonsecure products entering the nations, in particular those going to our children.
We also recognize the fact that to find practical, pragmatic solutions to our mutual environmental challenges, our countries are working to find our own sustainable energy and to find national standards on energy efficiency.
Finally—and this is particularly important for Canada—we realize that border security must not threaten the friendly relations that we have. We undertook agreements on cooperation, standards, regulations, pandemia, intellectual property, and research in the energy field. In the framework of this summit, we met the North American Competitiveness Council. Their leaders provided us with valuable information on how we could exploit our partnership in the field of security and prosperity to strengthen our economies and to create good jobs here in North America.
Our discussions did not merely deal with North America. We also discussed a number of other international and hemispheric questions: climate change and too the next meeting of the Middle East discussions, where our countries are defending democracy and freedom and protecting the have-nots.
This summit enabled us to discuss our singular bilateral discussions. President Bush and myself met yesterday afternoon. We discussed a number of subjects, in particular our joint commitment to have a secure border that shall remain open to goods and services and to the interaction between our respective citizens.
President Calderon and myself also had a meeting yesterday evening, and I would like to thank President Calderon and his wife Margarita and their children Maria, Felipe, for having passed a wonderful time with us last weekend. We understand that you have had to shorten your stay due to the consequences of Hurricane Dean on your country. I sincerely regret the terrible aspect of this Hurricane Dean on Mexico, but I understand the concern, that the Mexican authorities have assisted in evacuating a Canadian citizen.
We have been—also been able to arrange our agenda yesterday to discuss important matters for our respective nations. We were able to discuss a number of different matters and the flourishing development of trade between our two countries, and that we shall pursue in the future.
Canada, United States, and Mexico, are good neighbors and good friends. As sovereign nations in our modern world, we are not merely independent but also interdependent. And we are determined to cooperate for our mutual security, our continued economic growth, and the improvement of our North American relations are unique in the world.
[At this point, Prime Minister Harper continued in English.]
——the staff here and the people of Montebello for their warm Quebecois hospitality. You have every reason to be proud of this magnificent resort and this beautiful region.
As host of this year's North American leaders summit, it's my responsibility and pleasure to report that the discussions between Presidents Bush and Calderon and myself were as cordial as they were constructive. Our three countries share peaceful and productive relations that are of considerable benefit to the people of our respective nations. These relations are rooted in our common commitment to democracy, free and open markets through NAFTA, and equal opportunity for all of our citizens. This week's summit has provided an opportunity to share individual perspectives and to take stock of the challenges that we face together.
We agreed to work together on consumer protection. We have to identify and stop unsafe goods from entering our country, especially those designed for our children. We also agreed on the need for practical solutions to our mutual environmental challenges. Our countries are already working together to develop clean and sustainable energy, and we're cooperating on national fuel efficiency standards.
Finally—and this is especially important for Canada—we agreed that border security measures, critical as they are, cannot threaten the bonds of friendship or commerce between us.
Over the past year, we've achieved agreements on regulatory cooperation, pandemics, intellectual property, and research in energy. As part of our summit, we also met with the North American Competitiveness Council. The Council's business leaders have provided us with good, practical advice on how we can build our Security and Prosperity Partnership to strengthen our economies and create good jobs right here in North America.
But our discussions were not focused exclusively on North America. We also discussed a range of international and hemispheric issues, from climate change to the upcoming APEC meetings, from the Middle East to Haiti, where all three of our countries are working to advance freedom, democracy, and development for the most impoverished people.
Moreover, the summit provided opportunities for one-on-one discussions about our unique bilateral relationships. President Bush and I met yesterday afternoon. We discussed several matters, including our joint commitment to a secure border that remains open to the exchange of goods and services and the interaction of our people.
President Calderon and I met last night. First, let me take the opportunity to thank the President, his wife Margarita, and their children Maria, Felipe, and Juan Pablo, for spending some time this past weekend with our family. I understand you're cutting your visit short, given the impact of Hurricane Dean on your country. I regret the cost of this terrible natural disaster. At the same time, we appreciate the efforts of the Mexican authorities to secure the evacuation of Canadian citizens.
I'm grateful we were able to arrange our schedules yesterday to meet and discuss matters formally before your departure. We had the opportunity to discuss many issues related to the growing relationship between Canada and Mexico that we're going to lead forward together.
Canada, the United States, and Mexico are good neighbors and good friends. As sovereign countries in the modern world, we are both independent and interdependent. And we're committed to working together on mutual security, continued economic growth, and expanding our unique North American relationship.
President Bush.
President Bush. Thank you, Prime Minister. Thanks for having us here. I too want to thank the good folks of Montebello for their wonderful hospitality. The food was good; the hospitality was warm. You picked a great place to come.
I express my country's concerns for the citizens whose lives will be affected by Hurricane Dean. I respect the fact that President Calderon has decided to get back to Mexico as quickly as possible in a safe way. I want you to know that U.S. Agencies are in close touch with the proper Mexican authorities, and if you so desire help, we stand ready to help. The American people care a lot about the human condition in our neighborhood, and when we see human suffering, we want to do what we can to help alleviate that. So we wish you all good luck.
These meetings are—I'm not going to try to reiterate what Stephen said. He went through the list of the meetings. And he's a—he's right, that we talked about a lot of issues. I just want to give you the spirit of the discussions and why I think they're important.
It's in our people's interests that Canada and Mexico work closely together. In other words, there's a good reason why our leaders should come together on a regular basis. First reason why is to figure out ways to continue to enhance prosperity. It's in our interests that the Canadian lifestyle be as strong as it is, and it's in our interests that prosperity spread to Mexico. If you're a U.S. citizen, you want people that live close to you to be prosperous. The more prosperity there is in your neighborhood, the more hopeful your neighborhood is.
NAFTA, which has created a lot of political controversy in our respective countries, has yielded prosperity. Since NAFTA came to be, trade between our respective countries has grown from $293 billion a year to $883 billion a year. Now, for some, those are just numbers, but for many, it's improved wages and a better lifestyle and more hope. And the question that we're faced with is, how do we continue to enhance prosperity so the average citizen understands the benefits of three countries working together? And I think we made some good progress toward eliminating barriers and toward harmonizing regulations to a point where more prosperity will come to be.
And we discussed a lot of other issues. We discussed bilateral issues. Stephen and I talked about border issues. Of course, Felipe Calderon and I talked about border issues and migration. These are complicated issues, but they're issues that we can work out in good spirit as friends.
One reason one meets is to reconfirm friendships, is to make sure that not only at the leaders' level is there conversations taking place that are friendly but that that spirit translates throughout our governments. And I think we've accomplished that objective today.
We also talked, as Stephen mentioned, about international issues, issues of—concerning South America or the Middle East. These are meaningful discussions. I'm glad I came, and I'm looking forward to hosting them next year. Matter of fact, it's in the interests of our countries that we have these meetings on an annual basis and then have working groups follow through on the discussion items that—during our meetings with the business leaders or our own Cabinet Secretaries.
And so thanks for having me. It's been worthwhile. I appreciate it.
Prime Minister Harper. Senor Calderon.
President Calderon. Gracias. Thank you, Prime Minister Harper and President Bush. In the first place, I would like to thank very specifically—I would like to thank you for the solidarity, the understanding, and the support that I have received from you in order to, well, adjust my schedule to exhaust pending matters and allow me to return in good time in order to personally tend to the emergency situation that we have to face in the Yucatan Peninsula.
Your understanding and support is also accompanied by the offers of health—help and solidarity to the victims of this national disaster. So far—well, it would be too early to assess the scope of the damages. So far there have been no fatal victims. We can't be sure yet, but we are monitoring the situation every minute, monitoring the hurricane. And as a matter of fact, I'm returning to Yucatan right away, as soon as my aircraft can land, and supervise the rescue missions.
I would also like to thank very sin-cerely—thank you for the hospitality and for the human warmth, for the very welcoming attitude of Mr. Harper's family. And I do value this. It was a marvelous weekend for my family, such a typically Canadian place—typically, Canadian places are amongst the most beautiful in the world. And I would like to thank your wife Laureen and your children for your offer to spend this time with my family, with my wife and with my children. And I hope I'll be able to return your very nice present in Mexico.
Now, this meeting allows me to reinforce the conviction that North America as a region still has not developed the enormous potential it has. And I'm more convinced about this today than ever before, that it has to be developed. There's no doubt that the globalization process that we are currently experiencing is definitely pressuring throughout competitiveness of our countries—and not only countries but the competitiveness of the countries that have joined into regions.
Now, Canada, U.S., and Mexico have to act together in order not only to improve the quality of life of our people but also to prevent the vast integration process that we've seen in other parts of the world: Asia, Europe, very specifically. We don't want this to displace our producers and displace opportunities for our consumers.
Now, through working groups that we've established through the opinions of the businessmen of all three countries and their recommendations to our respective governments, it's clear to me that there's an enormous agenda that has to be developed, carried out. So I believe that we must relaunch in a more stronger way the strength of the relationship between the three countries of North America. That is to say that each country, each government is facing within their own public opinion—now particularly in Mexico, maybe in the U.S.— they're encountering resistance in relation to one or another aspect—investments, immigration, border crossings, and regulatory aspects.
And all these matters, which most of them are covered by the recommendations of the businessmen that we met, they've come to stand still. And this is a result of the concerns in each country, obstacles that—to the economic integration of our region. I believe we should reassess, or we should have our people reassess what all this means to the common citizen, the region; what it means to the consumers to have better prices and better quality in the products they consume; also, in what it represents for companies to have access to commodities that are more efficient, more productive, better quality, and better priced; also, what it represents to our workers to have available work, thanks to the fact that North America can be a fully integrated region.
Now, at the same time, there are complementary characteristics between the three countries. And this has got to be very specifically addressed in order to leverage the situation in this new century of globalization.
And we agreed also to prioritize certain issues that have been followed up on. For example, when it comes to regional competitiveness, it's quite clear that this is a very important priority. Also, the border area issue—we all want secure and also efficient borders, borders that will allow the border crossing of those who build, who contribute, and of course, prevent border crossings to those that damage our societies: organized crime, drug trafficking, all the trade in illegal goods.
Also, we talked about sustainable development and the challenges faced by countries, by our region, and by humanity as a whole. And so we talked about our common purpose to find reliable alternatives that will allow us, on the one hand, to preserve the environment, and at the same time, they will not force us to detain or stop our development and thereby have an impact on the prosperity of our people.
We also talked about security. This is a topic that concerns us all, but as President Bush said, we talked about prosperity. And I believe that this meeting—in my case, it's my first meeting, the first meeting I'm participating in—I think this meeting could be the beginning of a new age in the framework of the relationship of the three countries, and—particularly if we relaunch the trade exchange and also if we are able to take advantage of our potential.
I also thank President Bush for his invitation to come to Texas next year in order to continue with these talks. And also, Mexico is interested in hosting the meeting in 2009 in my beloved, dear, beautiful country.
Therefore, the issues were multifarious, and we took advantage of the time we had, although it was reduced because of this emergency situation that we're facing. I'm very happy that the environment within which we worked was very positive, very constructive on the part of everyone in attendance. And we hope that we'll be able to follow up on all the commitments, on the priorities that we've established, and on the recommendations that we've received from the business sector.
Thank you very much, Prime Minister Harper, for your hospitality. Thank you to the Canadian people and the people of Quebec for your hospitality and to the staff of this wonderful place in Montebello that treated us so generously. And well, we will be at your disposal when you come to us.
Moderator. Conference de presse, good afternoon. We'll begin with the press conference. And just a reminder, it's one question per reporter. We will start with Ben Feller, Associated Press.
Progress in Iraq/Hurricane Dean
Q. Thank you all. Mr. President, yesterday Senator Levin, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said that the Iraqi parliament ought to oust Prime Minister Maliki and his Government for being politically unable to deliver political unity there, for utterly failing on that point. I'm wondering what your reaction is to Senator Levin's comment and whether you think Maliki has lost credibility.
And if I may, President Calderon——
Moderator. I just ask that you limit yourself to one question, please.
Q. I'm just wondering the assessment of the damage in your country, the hurricane damage.
President Bush. The way I view Iraq is from the security perspective and a political perspective. I made a decision to send more troops into Iraq to provide enough security for reconciliation to have a time to take place. It appears to me—and I simply don't—I certainly don't want to prejudge General David Petraeus's report back home, but there is some progress being made. In other words, one aspect of my decision is working.
There are two types of political reconciliation that can take place in a new democracy. One is from the top down, and one is from the bottom up. Clearly, the Iraqi Government has got to do more through its parliament to help heal the wounds of years of—having lived years under a tyrant, see. It's not easy to go from a tyrannical society where the tyrant brutalized his people and created deep suspicions into one in which people are willing to work more closely together.
The Iraqi people made a great step toward reconciliation when they passed the most modern Constitution in the Middle East, and now their Government has got to perform. And I think there's a certain level of frustration with the leadership in general, inability to work—to come together to get, for example, an oil revenue law passed or Provincial elections.
On the other hand, I do want to point out that the Iraqi parliament has met and passed 60 different pieces of legislation. They do have a budgeting process that is in the process of distributing a significant amount of money from the central Government to the Provincial governments, and the money they're distributing is oil revenues. So there may not be an oil revenue distribution law, but there's oil revenues being distributed.
There's a bottom-up reconciliation taking place. It's noticeable and tangible and real, where people at the grassroots level are sick and tired of the violence, sick and tired of the radicalism, and they want a better life. And they're beginning to reject the extremists that have the desire to have a safe haven, for example, from which to launch further attacks on America. In other words, there's a process taking place. And the fundamental question is, will the Government respond to the demands of the people? And if the Government doesn't de-mand—respond to the demands of the people, they will replace the Government. That's up to the Iraqis to make that decision, not American politicians. The Iraqis will decide. They have decided they want a constitution, they have elected members to their parliament, and they will make the decisions, just like democracies do.
And the question that we have to face in America is, is it worth it? Does it matter whether or not this young democracy survive? Is it in our national interests that this difficult experiment with democracy in the Middle East work? And I've come to the conclusion that it is. It's in our interests because a failed Iraq could easily yield a safe haven from which the extremists and radicals who once attacked us could attack us again. A failed Iraq would become a recruiting tool for the very same people that still want to attack America. And so it's in our interests.
I told you the other day at a press conference—I don't know if you were there or not—but if you don't believe it's in American interests to be there, you won't find any political reconciliation that is worth defending. If you do think it's in our interests, our security interests, then you'll be able to see political reconciliation taking place, some at the top and some at the bottom.
Now, Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus will be coming back to brief the Congress in about a month's time, and I'm looking forward to hearing their briefing. And I would hope that Members of Congress from both political parties listen very carefully to the report they bring back, as we all make decisions about what's best for our national security in regards to this one theater in the war against the extremists and radicals.
President Calderon. What I can tell you, as you are well aware, Hurricane Dean touched down in Mexico north of Chetumal, which is the State of Quintana Roo, which is on the borders with Belize, with winds of 250 and gusts of winds beyond 350 k. It was a category 5 hurricane; that is the most dangerous. And the initial reports I have, the most important is, until today, but I've not discarded it, but there has been no loss of human life. We still have to know what happened in the more isolated communities in that area.
Our authorities are all over that area, the civil protection area. People are there who are experts in dealing with hurricane matters. There was a power outage to Chetumal, but we have checked with the energy authorities of the Federal level, that power outage will be repaired in the coming hours, and possibly it is.
The hurricane, fortunately, did not go through the main tourist areas—Cancun, Riviera Maya. And more—the daily routine activities in those cities are being reestablished. And they had major flooding or incoming tidal waves, shall we say. But everything has recovered.
I went over the more poor Mayan areas, and I have a great deal of concern for the housing and the lack of services in that general area for the indigenous people there. And that will be the main area of concern for us and activities.
It is now going to Campeche, and we have other concerns, insofar as that is concerned. We have logistical support of the resistance or the maintenance of electrical lines that provide energy throughout the Yucatan Peninsula. We have—in Merida, we have hydroelectric plants that can come in on an emergency.
The layout of the Campeche State, which is a very low level—it is almost at sea level. And there could be a wave increase in height in the tide that may bring about some flooding and might create more difficulties that will be more difficult to resolve.
We are then awaiting that Hurricane Dean will enter the Campeche area, where the main oil production occurs in Mexico. We have ordered the suspension of oil production. Almost 20,000 workers have been taken away from the platforms, and there's about two and a half million oil barrels have been lost until now. But we have been able to save lives. And later again, the Hurricane Dean will go into Veracruz, and this will create different problems to that—to those of the Yucatan Peninsula, that is, the increase of the tidal bore up the rivers and other aspects to the north of Veracruz. Fortunately, Hurricane Dean was a category 5 but is now a category 3 and is about to drop into category 2. Our fear is that it will regain strength once it enters the Gulf of Mexico after Campeche.
But we are ready. The equipment, the teams are ready. The hydroelectric power is being restored. And there has not been major material damage in the major touristic areas that have been hit by other hurricanes. That is what I know today.
Moderator. I'd like to remind you one more time that it's one question per reporter.
Northwest Passage
Q. President Bush and Mr. Harper, we know the differences between the two countries insofar as the Northwest Passage is concerned. We heard the former Ambassador, Paul Cellucci, that it would be in the best interests of security for the United States to recognize this passage as a Canadian waterway. So I would like to hear your comments, from both of you. Failing which, there is if not a way—could we consider to hear to what extent you would be willing to consider the Northwest Passage to become an international waterway?
Prime Minister Harper. I shall reply, to start off with. I did hear the comments of the former Ambassador Paul Cellucci. We also know that there are certain differences of opinion vis-a-vis this passage between our two nations. But quite honestly, Canada's position is that we intend to strengthen our sovereignty in the Arctic area, not only military but economic, social, environmental, and others.
The former agreements of President Reagan and Prime Minister Mulroney in the eighties—Canada and the United States did resolve their differences in this area.
[Prime Minister Harper continued in English.]
——the statement by former Ambassador Cellucci. Canada, as you know, is fully committed to strengthening its Arctic sovereignty on every level, not just military but economic, social, environmental, any other method, any other means.
Canada and the U.S. do have differences on certain aspects of the Northwest Passage. At the same time, since the agreements of Prime Minister Mulroney and former President Reagan in the late 1980s, Canada and the United States have been able to manage these differences, and we think we'll be able to continue to do that.
President Bush. Yes, we'll manage the differences—because there are differences on the Northwest Passage. We believe it's an international passageway. Having said that, the United States does not question Canadian sovereignty over its Arctic islands, and the United States supports Canadian investments that have been made to exercise its sovereignty.
Moderator. We will continue with Roberto Gonzalez, diario Uno Mas Uno.
Stock Markets/National Economies
Q. Good afternoon. This question is to the three leaders. The stock exchange mar-kets—the stock markets have gone through a severe crisis in recent weeks. How close are we to a stock exchange crash, and what measures have you taken so that it does not affect the real economy?
So when you will be presenting your first report, there's an opposition party that wants to prevent this—what is the outlook in your view? What's the outlook? And do you trust—do you believe that the opposition will accept your invitation for a dialog?
President Calderon. Well, to answer the first question, there's the financial problem, which is quite delicate in several markets. What I can tell you in relation to the case of Mexico, fortunately, our financial system has been solid enough to resist these critical times. I know that many central banks in several parts of the world, the European Union, the Federal Reserve in the U.S., and other central banks, have applied considerable resources in order to bring liquidity to their financial and banking systems.
Now, fortunately, in the case of Mexico, this has not been necessary. The financial system and the banking system is very solid. It took us a lot of work, a lot of money to have such a solid system that would resist situations like this, but fortunately, it has not required the support of liquidity from the Central Bank of Mexico.
Currently, the Mexican Stock Exchange has adjusted fixed income values. This is the case throughout the world. However, the Mexican Stock Exchange was one of the five that actually had an increase in its value throughout the world last year, over 50 percent. And obviously, the reduction that we're seeing is somehow or another a form of a correction, which will actually improve the health of the financial markets in Mexico.
Could it have an impact in the real economy? Well, that depends on the scope of the situation, how it affects the markets, particularly the North American markets, which affects us most. My belief is that the situation is beginning to stabilize. And it will depend on the impact that it might have on the growth of the U.S., which, as you know, Mexico depends on this growth, on the U.S. growth.
Now, in relation to the second subject, the second issue, I have invited legislators. I'm a democrat that believes in the basic ideas and that believes in constructing dialog, and this is what I'm seeking in Congress, constructive dialog. Unfortunately, I still haven't received a positive answer from this—in relation to this invitation, but I believe, I trust that in the future, there will be greater willingness to talk about issues of concern for all Mexicans.
I know it's another system, Canada is, but Prime Minister Harper has to talk to his Parliament just about every day, every week. And I think—I would say that we would—I would very much like to have an institutional way in Mexico so that we're able to work and to talk about what we agree with and what we don't agree with in our country. I'll be willing to talk to anybody that wants to talk to me, particularly within Congress.
Now, in relation to the attitude of the PRD or other members of that party, I respect them, and of course, I appeal to the sense of responsibility towards the country. And I hope that maturity will prevail and common sense too. So the only thing that will b","e lost with this is that anybody that breaks the basic laws of our institutional life—let's say that citizens know very well and recognize the maturity and the responsibility of political parties, and the people of our country are able to punish these attitudes too.
Prime Minister Harper. Our monetary and financial systems that monitor it are following it closely. But naturally, there are certain differences in their assets and liabilities, and some of the major corporations will have drops in their stocks. That is the normal course. But I can assure you that the capital situation of our major corporations, our financial institutions, of our individual persons are very strong.
[Prime Minister Harper continued in English.]
Our economic and financial institutions that are responsible for watching these markets are monitoring them closely. At the same time, just to remind people, it's normal for the price of assets of various securities or companies or whatever to go up and down in the marketplace. It's not unusual. I can assure you that the position of Canadian financial sector, in particular our banks, Canadian companies in general, and the household sector, our capital positions are very strong.
President Bush. The fundamentals of the U.S. economy are strong. Inflation is down; interest rates are low; the employment picture is strong; exports are up. We grew at over 3 percent in the second quarter. The fundamental question is, is there enough liquidity in our system as people readjust risk? And the answer is, yes, there is.
Moderator. Bret Baier, FOX News.
Canada-Mexico-U.S. Trade Relations
Q. Thank you. As you three leaders meet here, there are a growing number of people in each of your countries who have expressed concern about the Security and Prosperity Partnership. This is addressed to all three of you. Can you say today that this is not a prelude to a North American union, similar to a European Union? Are there plans to build some kind of superhighway connecting all three countries? And do you believe all of these theories about a possible erosion of national identity stem from a lack of transparency from this partnership?
Prime Minister Harper. Thank you for— well, let me begin. And I guess I've read some things from my opposition in Canada. I'm not sure these are generally expressed concerns, but a couple of my opposition leaders have speculated on massive water diversions and superhighways to the continent, maybe interplanetary, I'm not sure, as well. [Laughter] I even—there were reports of a former Prime Minister lurking in the hallways. I have yet to see him.
Look, we have an enormous trading commercial relationship. It's important that the leaders of that trading relationship get together periodically, have discussions, just as it's important at every level—ministerial level, official level—that they're getting together and talking and making sure they're working out problems.
You know, we had some business leaders in front of us today. One in particular said, you know, the rules for jelly beans—he manufactures jelly beans—the rules for jelly bean contents are different in Canada and the United States. They have to maintain two separate inventories. Is the sovereignty of Canada going to fall apart if we standardize the jelly bean? I don't think so. Maybe Mr. Dion thinks so, but I don't think so.
So these are pragmatic, practical discussions. In fact, it was my predecessor in the Liberal Party who initiated them. And ultimately, of course, for the decisions, we're responsible to our respective populations. We're a democratic system, and as President Calderon mentioned, I have to listen to that practical input every single day in Parliament.
President Calderon. Well, in fact, I'll be happy with one step in Mexicali and one in Tijuana. In actual fact, there are several myths about this meeting; some are more jovial, funnier than others. But what we are trying to do is simply to meet, talk about our common problems, and see what we can do in practical terms in order to improve the lives of our people. Whether it's to standardize the parameters for chocolates or medicines, I think these are commonsense things. And moreover, I think— and I'll tell you this very clearly—I think that as a region, we are losing competitiveness in comparison with other regions in the world.
And it's not a question of customs unions, let alone having an integration that would actually be—encroach on the sovereignty and culture and resources of each country. We simply have to take advantage of this opportunity of being neighbors and allies in order to generate prosperity and security for our people. And that is the purpose of these meetings.
Now let me tell you that, at times, I would even like to work faster, review more issues, but we have to be very patient. And something that we did talk about also, which is part of my responsibility or our responsibilities as leaders, is to talk to the people and tell them why it's important to have better trading rules; why it's important not to have so many barriers between ourselves; why is it important to resolve issues such as immigration, investment, because that could actually improve the quality of life for our people. It could mean the Mexican consumers could have better products, Canadian products, U.S. products and—well, Mexican products also—because there would be more investment in our country, which requires thousands and thousands of jobs in order to resolve the problems of the people. And that happens when there's investment, and there's only investment when there is competitiveness. And we do have a way to go in that regard.
President Bush. We represent three great nations. We each respect each other's sovereignty. You know, there are some who would like to frighten our fellow citizens into believing that relations between us are harmful for our respective peoples. I just believe they're wrong. I believe it's in our interest to trade; I believe it's in our interest to dialog; I believe it's in our interest to work out common problems for the good of our people.
And I'm amused by some of the speculation, some of the old—you can call them political scare tactics. If you've been in politics as long as I have, you get used to that kind of technique, where you lay out a conspiracy and then force people to try to prove it doesn't exist. And that's just the way some people operate. I'm here representing my nation. I feel strongly that the United States is a force for good, and that I feel strongly that by working with our neighbors, we can be a stronger force for good.
And so I appreciate that question. I'm amused by the difference between what actually takes place in the meetings and what some are trying to say takes place. It's quite comical, actually, when you realize the difference between reality and what some people are talking on TV about.
Prime Minister Harper. Might I add, in French, I did not know that there were these major plots that were mentioned by the head of the opposition, Mr. Martin, a Liberal Prime Minister, who initiated these discussions, I believe, for Mr. Dion. It is a rather regressive step backwards to this whole question of our NAFTA discussions and SPP.
Canada's Role in Afghanistan
Q. My question is for President Bush. Mr. President, it's become increasingly likely that Canada will withdraw from its current combat role in southern Afghanistan in February of 2009. Many Canadians, including politicians of different political stripes, have suggested that Canada's military has done its job in the country, that it's played its part, and it would be time to go home then. I'd like to ask you if you believe that Canada has done its job and has fulfilled its duties.
President Bush. I believe Canada has done a fabulous job in Afghanistan. And I thank the people of Canada, but more importantly, the people of Afghanistan thank the people of Canada.
Canadian—the Canadian people sent some of your finest into harm's way to enable a young democracy to not only survive but thrive. And it's been an important contribution in this global struggle against extremists. We're in an ideological struggle against people who use murder and death to achieve political objectives, and the fundamental question is, will free nations help young democracies survive in the face of this threat? And Canada has performed brilliantly. And I thank the mothers and fathers or sons and daughters of those who lost their life in this, for the sake of freedom and peace for the ultimate sacrifice they paid.
Secondly, the Canadian contribution is more than just combat. The Canadian contribution is to help build institutions for a democracy to survive. So the contribution has been vast, and it's been robust. And this Government, along with its parliament, will make decisions what's best for the Canadian people and the people of Afghanistan.
The United States is firmly committed to Afghanistan. We view this as a part of the war against the extremists and radicals. We view this as a significant portion of the ideological struggle, and we believe that when democracy prevails in Afghanistan, it will be a major blow toward those who want to impose a totalitarian view on others.
We believe, for example, it's important for Afghan girls to get a good education. I know the Canadian people feel the same way. We believe that it's important for women to have rights and to serve in the Parliament. We believe peace is achieved when forms of government give people an opportunity to express themselves in a peaceful way in society. That's what we believe. And one reason we have that strong belief is, we believe in the universality of liberty. We don't believe freedom is just confined to our neighborhood, we believe freedom is universal in its application. That's what we believe. We believe people want to be free, and if given a chance, they will exercise what is necessary to be free, and that freedom yields peace.
I'm giving a speech tomorrow where I'm going to talk about our engagement in Asia and how Asia has been transformed because of liberty. A place where Canadians and U.S. soldiers died in large numbers is now a place of peace and prosperity, where governments evolved in their own— representing their own traditions and history, but nevertheless evolved in a way with liberty as its basis.
And the question we're all confronted with—who live in comfortable societies— is it worth it for our own security to help others realize the blessings of freedom? And my decision is, absolutely, it is. I think it's the calling of the 21st century. I think it's the calling of history. And I appreciate the strong commitment that this Government and the Canadian people have made toward writing the first chapter of what will be laying the foundation of peace throughout the 21st century.
Prime Minister Harper. Might I say that our troops are there. Parliament will make its own decision on the extension of this mission. But at the same time, you the Canadians can be extremely proud of the work done by our troops, our soldiers, our diplomats, our agents that are there working to develop the country, working for one of the peoples that are the poorest in the world. In Kandahar, we have given the possibility to men, women, and children to have some freedom and some safety and security that we have here in Canada.
I note the passing away—the dying of the soldier Longtin. And his brethren, his comrades are there to uphold those same values and carry on the dead's life to help their brothers and sisters in countries abroad.
[Prime Minister Harper continued in English.]
To repeat that, I think we can all be very proud of the work that Canadian troops are doing in Afghanistan. Parliament will make its decision in due course whether it wants to prolong the mission. But I think our difference there—our position there, our presence there has made a real difference in giving just a tiny bit of the freedom, the opportunity, and the security that we have as Canadians, that we take for granted as Canadians.
I note the death of obviously—of a Canadian soldier—Longtin, I think, was the name. We are very fortunate we have a volunteer army, very fortunate to have men and women who put on the uniform willing to defend our values and also improve the lives of their fellow human beings and do so at tremendous personal risk for themselves. And I think we should all appreciate that.
Moderator. We have time for one last question—[inaudible].
Narcotics and Drug Trafficking
Q. Good afternoon, President Bush and Prime Minister. And I thought that this summit would be the—would—actually Plan Mexico would come out of this, the combination of three governments to combat the effects of drug trafficking. What is the obstacle? What is it causing the delay? Why don't the societies of each country know what this plan is about? And can you actually confirm the support of the United States to Mexico? Apparently, it will increase tenfold, and the levels will be similar to Colombia. We hear very often that the United States wants to take part in this situation against drugs, this war on drugs, and we see it very clearly in Mexico. Now, what is it all about? Could you tell us?
President Bush. Man! [Laughter] Hombre! [Laughter] We discussed a common strategy to deal with a common problem, and that is narcotrafficking and violence on our border. First, let me say that in order to develop an effective, common strategy requires—there needs to be serious consultations between our respective governments. It's one thing to say, we're interested in working together, it's another thing to develop a package on both sides of the border that will be effective in dealing with the problem. That's what our people expect us to do. They expect us to see a problem and to develop an effective strategy to deal with that problem.
President Calderon and I met in Mexico, and we had a serious discussion to get this initiative on the table. This is an interim meeting, a meeting for us to make sure that the strategy that's being developed is— will be effective. And so we reviewed where we are in the process.
The United States is committed to this joint strategy to deal with a joint problem. I would not be committed to dealing with this if I wasn't convinced that President Calderon had the will and the desire to protect his people from narcotraffickers. He has shown great leadership and great strength of character, which gives me good confidence that the plan we'll develop will be effective. And the fundamental question is, what can we do together to make sure that the common strategy works? And that's where we are in the discussions right now.
There's all kinds of speculation about the size of the package, this, that, and the other. All I can tell you is, the package, when it's developed, will be robust enough to achieve a common objective, which is less violence on both sides of the border and to deal with narcotrafficking. And we both have responsibilities. And that's what the package is entailed to develop. It's to develop how do we share our joint responsibilities.
It's in our interests that this program go forward. You mentioned Plan Colombia; this is not like Plan Colombia. This is different from Plan Colombia. This is a plan that says, we've got an issue on our own border. We share a border, and therefore, it's a joint program that will mean—that won't mean U.S. armed presence in your country. Mexico is plenty capable of handling the problem. And the question is, is there any way for us to help strengthen the effort? And so that's what we're studying.
And I can't give you a definitive moment when the plan will be ready, but we're working hard to get a plan ready. And it's a plan that, once it's proposed and out there, I strongly urge the United States Congress to support. It's in our interests, it's in the U.S. interests that we get this issue solved.
President Calderon. Thank you, President Bush, for your comments and also for the question, because this allows us to emphasize the fact that—well, the President has already said, it's a common strategy to combat, in a coordinated way, a common problem. Drug trafficking and violence that's associated to drug trafficking, which is particularly evident on the border between the U.S. and Mexico, cannot be dealt with in an isolated way. It has to be confronted by, dealt with by the people and by the governments that are directly affected by this scourge. And it requires a variety, a multiplicity of actions carried out by society, by governments, in other words, enforcement activities against criminals, preventive activities, protective activities, prevention and treatment of addictions with the young.
Now, I agree with President Bush; it's very important to reduce—well, to have clear policies to reduce the consumption patterns in terms of drugs, including Mexico, because this is a main cause of the problem that we're facing.
Now, last week, for example, last week, three Federal policemen were murdered in Mexico—Mexican policemen, that is—and they were tortured in a very cowardly way. And those Mexican policemen are fully committed towards the Government to free the young Mexicans from drugs and to free Mexican society from slavery on the part of organized crime based on money and technology. And I don't want any—not one single Mexican policeman to have a logistical disadvantage when facing these criminals. I don't want my Government to be responsible for any omission, any legal omission within a legal framework that would have been directed towards defeating these criminals.
So this is a common strategy because it means that the U.S. will do its part and Mexico will do its part. Now, what do we want the U.S. to do—to carry out—have greater surveillance along the border. We are seeing high-powered weapons into Mexico, and we know that we can do much more than we're doing at this point in time. I know that drugs go from Mexico to the U.S. Both of us have to agree so that there is surveillance, efficient surveillance, that is, on both sides of the border. We are facing mafias that are working on both sides of the border. That is quite clear to us. And I think that we will not be acting in an efficient way as long as they have a coordinated strategy and we don't. In other words, they're coordinated on both sides of the border; we are not.
So I would like to introduce into the— well, we have to be respectful of our legislation, our respective legislations. I would want to create a strategy in order to defeat this scourge. And that requires a variety of instruments, strategies, exchange of intelligence, exchange of technology. It also means that we have to keep in mind issues of sovereignty. I told President Bush, though, we did not want to have U.S. soldiers working in our country, as has happened in other countries. I know that that's typical, of course. But we've said this very clearly, we put forth this very clearly, and in the framework of our own legislations, we will find a way out.
And I would also wonder what the men and women are thinking now, those who are suffering from crime, how scared are they, what's the degree of their fear that has led these groups to be so powerful, to grow so much. And they've essentially taken power in their area of operation. We have developed an aggressive policy to combat organized crime, and I haven't hesitated to use our forces to recover the areas. We've taken about 10,000 drug traffickers to jail, many weapons, 50-millimeter cannons, grenades capable of bringing down aircraft.
And I think—so I cannot send the Mexican policemen to combat this situation with their hands tied. So I have to answer to the Mexican people in order to preserve their security, and I will do so without abusing human rights and without distorting Mexican legislation. I will respect Mexican legislation fully. But I am calling upon my neighbor in order to act in a coordinated way, because it's a situation we both have to face. It's a problem that affects two countries, and only together will we be able to solve it.
There are several causes. It involves several joint responsibilities. And the action, therefore, has to be shared, within the legal framework. What's the scope of this strategy? I cannot tell you now; we cannot tell you now. We're just exchanging assessments, needs, assessing the situation and making it clear what the rules are for each country.
We will have a strategy—I think it's possible—but we will not be able to come up with it until we finish our discussions and negotiations, which, by nature, are very complex. But in the end, that is what we're trying to combat. And it's a problem that's affecting Mexican citizens as well as U.S. nationals.
Prime Minister Harper. This is an example. We are all sovereign nations, that is quite true, but we are not isolated problems according to our own sovereignty. We have shared problems—for example, drug trafficking. This is a good example. It begins in a country in the Americas or in the Caribbean, but the consequences are seen in the streets in Canada. And we have to discuss these problems. We have to compare our strategies, and sometimes we have to work hand in hand.
[Prime Minister Harper continued in English.]
Once again, this is a perfect example of why we meet. We're sovereign countries, but problems are not—problems don't limit themselves to the boundaries of our countries. Drug trafficking is a perfect example. These problems may originate in some of the countries of Latin America or the Caribbean, but the problems are felt on the streets and the communities of Canada. And that's why we meet to discuss; that's why we meet to compare strategies; that's why we, from time to time, have to engage in shared action.
Let me just say one other thing, if I can, about the drug trade, because indirect reference was made to Colombia. Canada has undertaken negotiations of a trade agreement with Colombia. We have a Government in Colombia that wants to share in the benefits of free and open markets. We don't need to have a trade agreement to have a drug trade with Colombia. The drug traffickers aren't going to wait for our parliaments or our congresses to pass a trade agreement in order to have a drug trade. But if we want to have other opportunities for the people of Colombia and mutual development and shared prosperity, we've got to move forward on these kinds of initiatives. And that's why the Government of Canada is committed to working with Colombia and getting a trade deal.
Moderator. Thank you very much. This brings an end to the press conference."
"February 28, 2008",The President's News Conference,George W. Bush,"George W. Bush, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/277248",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1130,"The President. Good morning. Laura and I, as you know, recently came back from Africa, where we saw firsthand how the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief is saving lives. I had a chance to go to the—speak to the Sullivan Foundation the other day about our trip, and the reason I did so was to remind the American people about how important it is for our Nation to remain generous and compassionate when it comes to helping people overseas.
I also during my trip urged Congress to reauthorize the emergency plan and increase our commitment, and they did. They approved a good, bipartisan bill that maintains the principles that have made this program effective. And so I want to thank Acting Chairman Howard Berman and Ranking Member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and all the members of the committee for the action they took. This afternoon they're going to come down, and I'll be able to thank them in person. And I'm going to brief them on the trip. The—obviously, our hope is now that the House will act quickly and send the bill reauthorizing PEPFAR to the Senate. And I'd like to sign it into law as quickly as possible.
Members should also act on a very urgent priority, and that is to pass legislation our intelligence officials need to quickly and effectively monitor terrorist communications. At issue is a dispute over whether telecommunications companies should be subjected to class-action lawsuits because they are believed to have helped defend America after the attacks of 9/11. Allowing these lawsuits to proceed would be unfair. If any of these companies helped us, they did so after being told by our Government that their assistance was legal and vital to our national security.
Allowing the lawsuits to proceed could aid our enemies because the litigation process could lead to the disclosure of information about how we conduct surveillance, and it would give Al Qaida and others a roadmap as to how to avoid the surveillance. Allowing these lawsuits to proceed could make it harder to track the terrorists because private companies besieged by and fearful of lawsuits would be less willing to help us quickly get the information we need. Without the cooperation of the private sector, we cannot protect our country from terrorist attack.
Protecting these companies from lawsuits is not a partisan issue. Republicans and Democrats in the United States Senate came together and passed a good bill protecting private companies from these abusive lawsuits. And Republicans and Democrats in the House stand ready to pass the Senate bill if House leaders would only stop blocking an up-or-down vote and let the majority in the House prevail.
Some in Congress have said we have nothing to worry about because if we lose the cooperation of the private sector, we can use the old FISA law. Well, they're wrong. FISA was out of date. It did not allow us to track foreign terrorists on foreign soil quickly and effectively. And that is why a dangerous intelligence gap opened up last year, and that is why Congress passed legislation that reformed FISA. But they did so only temporarily. The law expired; the threat to America has not expired.
Congress understood last year that FISA did not give our intelligence professionals the tools they needed to keep us safe. The Senate understands that the FISA—old FISA didn't give us the tools needed to protect America. The bipartisan bill it passes provides those tools our intelligence professionals need. Yet the House's failure to pass this law raises the risk of reopening a gap in our intelligence gathering, and that is dangerous.
Another vital priority for protecting the nation is prevailing in Iraq. Unfortunately, this week, the Senate debated yet another bill that threatens to cut off funding and tie the hands of our commanders in Iraq. It seems that no matter what happens in Iraq, opponents to the war have one answer: retreat.
When things were going badly in Iraq a year ago, they called for withdrawal. Then we changed our strategy, launched the surge, and turned the situation around. Since the surge began, high-profile terrorist attacks are down, civilian deaths are down, sectarian killings are down, and our own casualties are down. U.S. and Iraqi forces have captured or killed thousands of extremists, including hundreds of key Al Qaida operatives and leaders. Reconciliation is taking place in local communities across the country. That reconciliation is beginning to translate into political progress in the capital city.
In the face of these changes on the ground, congressional leaders are still sounding the same old call for withdrawal. I guess you could say that when it comes to pushing for withdrawal, their strategy is to stay the course. It's interesting that many of the same people who once accused me of refusing to acknowledge setbacks in Iraq now are the ones who are refusing to acknowledge progress in Iraq.
If we followed their advice a year ago, Iraq would be far different and more dangerous place than it is today, and the American people would be at greater risk. If we follow their advice now, we would put at risk the gains our troops have made over the past year. Congress does need to act when it comes to Iraq. What they need to do is stand by our brave men and women in uniform and fully fund the troops.
Finally, Congress needs to act to help homeowners avoid foreclosure. Unfortunately, the Senate is considering legislation that would do more to bail out lenders and speculators than to help American families keep their homes. The Senate bill would actually prolong the time it takes for the housing market to adjust and recover, and it would lead to higher interest rates. This would be unfair to the millions of homeowners who make the hard choices every month to pay their mortgage on time, and it would be unfair to future home-buyers. Instead, Congress should move ahead with responsible legislation to modernize the Federal Housing Administration and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. By taking these steps, we can help struggling homeowners and help our economy weather the difficult time in the housing market.
I'd be glad to take some questions. Terry [Terence Hunt, Associated Press].
National Economy
Q. Mr. President, bad economic news continues to pile up, the latest today, with the GDP barely growing. Are you concerned that a sagging economy and hard times will help defeat John McCain like it did your father in 1992? And how far are you willing to go to prevent that?
The President. I'm concerned about the economy because I'm concerned about working Americans, concerned about people who want to put money on the table and save for their kids' education. That's why I'm concerned about the economy. I want Americans working.
And there's no question, the economy has slowed down. You just cited another example of slowdown. I don't think we're headed to a recession, but no question, we're in a slowdown. And that's why we acted, and acted strongly, with over $150 billion worth of progrowth economic incentives, mainly money going into the hands of our consumers and some money going to incent businesses to invest, which will create jobs.
And so we've acted robustly. And now it's time to determine whether or not this progrowth package will actually work. Now the checks will start going out in the second week of May. There are going to be letters out soon explaining who is eligible for the refunds. Credit will happen in the first week of May. In other words, some people will choose to have their bank accounts credited. And in the second week of May, we anticipate the checks start moving out of Washington.
And the purpose is to encourage our consumers. The purpose is to give them money—their own to begin with, by the way—but give them money to help deal with the adverse effects of the decline in housing value. Consumerism is a significant part of our GDP growth. And we want to sustain the American consumer, encourage the American consumer, and at the same time, we want to encourage investment. So we'll see how the plan works.
Q. But the political context——
The President. Oh, you're trying to get me to be the pundit again. Look, you all figure that out. I mean, we—what I'm dealing with is the situation at hand, and I appreciate that—both Democrats and Republicans in the United States Congress and Senate for getting this bill done very quickly. And it's a substantial piece of legislation, and it's a good sign that we can figure out how to cooperate with each other at times.
And so we'll see the effects of this progrowth package. It's—I know there's a lot of—here in Washington, people are trying to—stimulus package two and all that stuff. Why don't we let stimulus package one, which seemed like a good idea at the time, have a chance to kick in?
Yes.
Turkey and Iraq
Q. Mr. President, Turkey's ground offensive in northern Iraq is now a week old with no end in sight. How quickly would you like to see Turkey end its offensive, its incursion? And do you have any concerns about the possibility of protracted presence in northern Iraq causing further destabilization in the region?
The President. A couple of points on that—one, the Turks, the Americans, and the Iraqis, including the Iraqi Kurds, share a common enemy in the PKK. And secondly, it's in nobody's interests that there be safe haven for people who are—have the willingness to kill innocent people.
A second point I want to make to you, Matt [Matt Spetalnick, Reuters], is that there is a Special Forces presence in northern Iraq, in Kurdistan, now, apart from what you're referring to. In other words— so there is a presence, and there has been a presence for a while.
Thirdly, I strongly agree with the sentiments of Secretary Gates, who said that the incursion must be limited and must be temporary in nature. In other words, it shouldn't be long lasting. But the Turks need to move, move quickly, achieve their objective, and get out.
Q. But how quickly, sir, do they need to move out?
The President. You know, as quickly as possible.
Q. Days or weeks?
The President. Well, as possible.
Russia-U.S. Relations
Q. Mr. President, I'd like to ask you about Russia. The Democratic candidates, when asked about the new Russian leader, Dmitry Medvedev, didn't appear to know a great deal about him. I wonder what you can say about him; how much power you think he's really got with Putin still in the picture?
And critics would say you badly misjudged Vladimir Putin. So what would be your cautionary tale to your successor about the threat Russia poses and how to deal with this new leader?
The President. I don't know much about Medvedev either. And what will be interesting to see is who comes to the—who represents Russia at the G-8, for example. It will be interesting to see—it will help, I think, give some insight as to how Russia intends to conduct foreign policy over— after Vladimir Putin's Presidency. And I can't answer the question yet.
I can say that it's in our interests to continue to have relations with Russia. For example, on proliferation matters, it's in our interest to be able to make sure that materials that could cause great harm aren't proliferated. It's in our interest to work together on Iran. As I said, I think, in this room the last time I was here, I appreciated the fact that Vladimir Putin told the Iranians that they will provide—they, Russia—will provide enriched uranium to run the Bushehr power plant, thereby negating the need for the Iranians to enrich in the first place. I thought that was a constructive suggestion. And we need to be in a position to be able to work with Russia on Iran.
There's a lot of areas where—yesterday, for example, with the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, I talked about a missile defense system in Europe. But I believe it's in our interests to try to figure out a way for the Russians to understand the system is not aimed at them but aimed at the real threats of the 21st century, which could be a launch from a violent regime—a launch of a weapon of mass destruction.
So there's areas, David [David Gregory, NBC News], where we need to cooperate and—let me finish—and so it's a—I'm going to try to leave it so whoever my successor is will be able to have a relationship with whoever is running foreign policy in Russia. It's just—it's in the country's interest. That doesn't mean we have to agree all the time. I mean, obviously, we didn't agree on Kosovo. There will be other areas where we don't agree. And yet it is in the interest of the country to have a relationship, leader to leader and, hopefully, beyond that.
Q. But I mean, first of all, are you suggesting or are you worried that, in fact, Medvedev is a puppet for Vladimir Putin? And——
The President. No, I wouldn't say that. I wouldn't—that's your conclusion, not mine.
Q. Well, no, I'm asking the question about whether you're concerned. But isn't there something you took away and that you can offer to your successor about how it's risky in the process of sizing up your Russian counterpart? Don't you think that you learned something from your time with Putin?
The President. Here's what I learned, here's what I learned. I learned that it's important to establish a personal relations with leaders even though you may not agree with them—certain leaders. I'm not going to have a personal relationship with Kim Jong Il, and our relationships are such that that's impossible.
But U.S.-Russian relations are important. It's important for stability. It's important for our relations in Europe. And therefore, my advice is to establish a personal relationship with whoever is in charge of foreign policy in Russia. It's in our country's interest to do so.
Now, it makes it easier, by the way, when there's a trustworthy relationship to be able to disagree and yet maintain common interests in other areas. And so we've had our disagreements. As you know, Putin is a straightforward, pretty tough character when it comes to his interests. Well, so am I. And we've had some headbutts, diplomatic headbutts. You might remember the trip to Slovakia. I think you were there at the famous press conference. But—and yet, in spite of that, our differences of opinion, we still have got a cordial enough relationship to be able to deal with common threats and opportunities. And that's going to be important for the next President to maintain.
Yes, Jonathan [Jonathan Karl, ABC News].
Military Operations in Iraq
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Yes, Jon.
Q. ——do you believe if we had the kind of rapid pullout from Iraq that the Democrats are talking about, that we'd be at greater risk of a terrorist attack here at home? And when Senator Obama was asked a similar question, he said, quote, ""If Al Qaida is forming a base in Iraq, then we will have to act in a way that secures the American homeland and our interests abroad.""
So I'm wondering if you——
The President. That's an interesting comment. If Al Qaida is securing a Al Qaida base—yes, well, that's exactly what they've been trying to do for the past 4 years. That's their stated intention, was to create enough chaos and disorder to establish a base from which to either launch attacks or spread a caliphate. And the intent of the surge was to send more marines into the area that—where they had proclaimed their desire to set up a base. That was Anbar Province. And so yes, I mean, that's one of the challenges we face, is denying Al Qaida a safe haven anywhere. And their intentions—that's what they said, that they would like to have a base or safe haven in Anbar Province.
Yes, Bill [Bill Plante, CBS News].
Q. But to the second part——
The President. No, next turn.
Q. But the part of the question about——
The President. Nice try. [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President——
The President. You obviously haven't been here long, Jon. Where have you been, Jonathan? [Laughter]
Q. Across the river.
The President. Yes, okay, yes.
Q. All right.
The President. Welcome to the other side. [Laughter]
Terrorist Surveillance Program/Intelligence Reform Legislation
Q. If you can get the Congress to protect telecom companies from lawsuits, then there's no recourse for Americans who feel that they've been caught up in this. I know it's not intended to spy on Americans, but in the collection process, information about everybody gets swept up, and then it gets sorted. So if Americans don't have any recourse, are you just telling them when it comes to their privacy to suck it up?
The President. The—I wouldn't put it that way, if I were you, in public, Bill. I mean, you've been around long enough to—anyway, yes, I—look, there's—people who analyze the program fully understand that America's civil liberties are well protected. There is a constant check to make sure that our civil liberties of our citizens aren't—you know, are treated with respect. And that's what I want, and that's what most—all Americans want.
Now, let me talk about the phone companies. You cannot expect phone companies to participate if they feel like they're going to be sued. I mean, it is—these people are responsible for shareholders; they're private companies. The Government said to those who have alleged to have helped us that it is in our national interests, and it's legal. It's in our national interests because we want to know who's calling who from overseas into America. We need to know in order to protect the people.
It was legal. And now, all of a sudden, plaintiffs' attorneys, class-action plaintiffs' attorneys, you know—I don't want to try to get inside their head; I suspect they see, you know, a financial gravy train—are trying to sue these companies. And first, it's unfair. It is patently unfair. And secondly, these lawsuits create doubts amongst those who will—whose help we need.
I guess you could be relaxed about all this if you didn't think there was a true threat to the country. I know there's a threat to the country. And the American people expect our Congress to give the professionals the tools they need to listen to foreigners who may be calling into the United States with information that could cause us great harm. So, on the one hand, the civil liberties of our citizens are guaranteed by a lot of checks in the system and scrutinized by the United States Congress.
And secondly, I cannot emphasize to you how important it is that the Congress solve this problem. The Senate has solved the problem. And people say, would you ever compromise on the issue? The Senate bill is a compromise. And there's enough votes in the House of Representatives to pass the Senate bill. It's a bipartisan bill. And the House leaders need to put it on the floor. Let the will of the House work. In my judgment, it happens to be the will of the people to give the professionals the tools they need to protect the country.
Elaine [Elaine Quijano, Cable News Network].
Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Adviser Joel Bagnal
Q. Mr. President, you've stressed over and over in recent days particularly the importance of FISA reform to help keep America safe, and yet you have not yet filled a key national security post. Fran Townsend announced her resignation months ago, in November. What is the delay there, and what are Americans to make of that delay? Is America less safe because of it?
The President. We got a fine man named Joel Bagnal working that office right now. He's a professional. I trust his judgment. He's a real good guy. And no, they shouldn't worry about Joel. He knows what he's doing.
John [John McKinnon, Wall Street Journal].
Q. But, sir, the American——
The President. John.
Q. The Homeland Security Adviser is a key post.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
Q. What's taking so long?
The President. Joel Bagnal has occupied the position, Elaine. He's doing the job, and I've got confidence in him. And so should the American people have confidence in him. He's a fine professional. He knows what he's doing. And I'm very comfortable in saying, on your cameras, that our staff in the White House, led by Joel Bagnal, knows what they're doing when it comes to advising the President on matters of homeland security.
John.
Trade
Q. Thanks, Mr. President. There's been a lot of criticism on the campaign trail of free-trade policies and even talk about the U.S. opting out of NAFTA. And it doesn't seem that you want to discuss the prospects of Republican candidates on the campaign trail this year, but——
The President. Not yet.
Q. Not yet. But just given all the concerns about the economy that people have, do you feel like you could win in a State like Ohio if you were running again for Presidency?
The President. Landslide, John. [Laughter] Look, I am a big believer in free trade. And the reason why is, I firmly believe that free trade is essential to the formation of high-paying, quality jobs. In other words, people who work for industries that export goods to overseas are likely to be paid more than their—other workers.
Secondly, if you look at the—our economic growth recently, particularly last year, a major portion of that growth came as a result of exports. It's an essential part of our economic picture.
Yes, I heard the talk about NAFTA. One statistic I think people need to know is, I think there's roughly, like, $380 billion worth of goods that we ship to our NAFTA partners on an annual basis. Now, $380 billion worth of goods means there's a lot of farmers and businesses, large and small, who are benefiting from having a market in our neighborhood. And the idea of just unilaterally withdrawing from a trade treaty because of trying to score political points is not good policy. It's not good policy on the merits, and it's not good policy to— as a message to send to our—people who have, in good faith, signed a treaty and worked with us on a treaty.
Thirdly, those of us who grew up in Texas remember what the border looked like when we were kids, and it was really poor. And you go down to that border today, it is prosperous on both sides of the river, to the credit of those who proposed NAFTA and to the credit of those who got NAFTA through the Congress. If you're worried about people coming into our country illegally, it makes sense to help a place like Mexico grow its economy. Most folks would rather be finding a job close to home; most folks would rather not try to get in the bottom of an 18-wheeler to come and put food on the table.
This agreement has meant prosperity on both sides of our borders, north and south. And I believe it's in the interests to continue to seek markets for our farmers, ranchers, and businesspeople. I also know it's in our interest to insist that when people sell products into our countries, that we get treated fairly. In other words, if we treat a country one way—people in a country one way—we expect to be treated the same way, like Colombia.
The Colombia free trade vote's coming up. Many of their products come into our country much easier than our products go into theirs. It makes sense to be treated equally. But on this vote, there's an additional consequence. If the Congress rejects the Colombia free trade agreement, it will sorely affect the national security interests of the United States. It will encourage false populism in our neighborhood. It will undermine the standing of courageous leaders like President Uribe. And I strongly urge the Congress, when they bring this—when the Colombia free trade agreement is brought to a vote, to seriously consider the consequences of rejecting this trade agreement.
Mike [Mike Emanuel, FOX News].
Terrorist Surveillance Program/Intelligence Reform Legislation
Q. Mr. President, on FISA, do you worry that perhaps some House Democratic leaders are playing a high-stakes game of wait and see, in terms of if we get attacked, we all lose; if we don't get attacked, then maybe that makes the case that you don't need all the powers in FISA?
The President. No, I don't think so. I mean, I think that's—that would be ascribing motives that are just—I just don't think they're the motives of the House leaders to do that. I think—look, I think they're really wrestling with providing liability protection to phone companies. I don't think there's—that's cynical or devious, Michael. That's just too risky.
A lot of these leaders understand that there is an enemy that wants to attack. The caucus, evidently, in the House, is— the Democratic caucus is, you know, is concerned about exactly Plante's question, you know. And I just can't tell you how important it is to not alienate or not discourage these phone companies.
How can you listen to the enemy if the phone companies aren't going to participate with you? And they're not going to participate if they get sued. Let me rephrase: less likely to participate. And they're facing billions of dollars of lawsuits, and they have a responsibility to their shareholders. And yet they were told what they were going to do is legal.
And anyway, I'm going to keep talking about the issue, Mike. This is an important issue for the American people to understand. And it's important for them to understand that no renewal of the PATRIOT Act—I mean, the Protect America Act— is dangerous for the security of the country, just dangerous.
I'm sure people, if they really pay attention to the details of this debate, wonder why it was okay to pass the Protect America Act last summer, late last summer, and all of a sudden, it's not okay to pass it now. And so I will keep talking about the issue and talking about the issue.
Michael [Michael Abramowitz, Washington Post].
President's Foreign Policy
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to ask you about another issue that's kind of come up on the campaign trail, in terms of discussion, which is—this is a point of view that has been espoused—that we would be better off if we talked to our adversaries, in particular, Iran and Cuba, you know, without preconditions. And as President, you have obviously considered and rejected this approach. And I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit of insight into your thinking about this, and just explain to the American people what is lost by talking with those when we disagree.
The President. What's lost by embracing a tyrant who puts his people in prison because of their political beliefs? What's lost is, it'll send the wrong message. It'll send a discouraging message to those who wonder whether America will continue to work for the freedom of prisoners. It'll give great status to those who have suppressed human rights and human dignity.
I'm not suggesting there's never a time to talk, but I'm suggesting now is not the time—not to talk with Raul Castro. He's nothing more than an extension of what his brother did, which was to ruin an island and imprison people because of their beliefs.
These wives of these dissidents come and see me, and their stories are just unbelievably sad. And it just goes to show how repressive the Castro brothers have been, when you listen to the truth about what they say. And the idea of embracing a leader who's done this without any attempt on his part to release prisoners and free their society would be counterproductive and send the wrong signal.
Q. But no one is saying embrace him; they're just saying talk——
The President. Well, talking to him is embracing. Excuse me. Let me use another word. You're right, embrace is like big hug, right? That's—you're looking——
Q. Right.
The President. I do embrace people. Mike, one of these days, I'm just thinking about—[laughter]. Right, okay, good. Thank you for reminding me to use a different word. Sitting down at the table, having your picture taken with a tyrant such as Raul Castro, for example, lends the status of the office and the status of our country to him. He gains a lot from it by saying, ""Look at me, I'm now recognized by the President of the United States.""
Now, somebody will say, well, I'm going to tell him to release the prisoners. Well, it's a theory that all you got to do is embrace, and these tyrants act. That's not how they act. That's not what causes them to respond. And so I made a decision quite the opposite, and that is to keep saying to the Cuban people, we stand with you. We will not sit down with your leaders that imprison your people because of what they believe. We will keep an embargo on you. We do want you to have money from people here in the homeland, but we will stay insistent upon this policy until you begin to get free.
And so that's the way I've conducted foreign policy and will continue to conduct foreign policy. I just remind people that the decisions of the U.S. President to have discussions with certain international figures can be extremely counterproductive. It can send chilling signals and messages to our allies; it can send confusion about our foreign policy; it discourages reformers inside their own country. And in my judgment, it would be a mistake, on the two countries you talked about.
Sheryl [Sheryl Gay Stolberg, New York Times].
2008 Presidential Election
Q. Mr. President, thank you. I want to bring you back to Senator Obama's comment on Iraq. Do you believe that his comment was naive?
The President. I believe Senator Obama better stay focused on his campaign with Senator Clinton, neither of whom has secured their party's nominee yet—nomination yet. And my party's nomination hasn't been decided yet either. And so there will be ample time to discuss whoever their candidate for—the positions of whoever their candidate is.
Nice try, Sheryl. Would you like to try another tack, another question?
Q. Well, earlier you said it was an interesting comment. Okay, I'll follow on it. About Iraq, you have said in the past that you want to——
Q. Come on. [Laughter]
Q. ——leave a sustainable policy.
The President. Yes.
Q. You said I could have another question.
The President. That's good. Yes, okay.
Q. If you want to leave your——
The President. Well, it was just a little, like—give her—should we vote on whether she gets another question? [Laughter]
Military Ope","rations in Iraq
Q. They're for me. [Laughter] You've said, Mr. President, that you want to leave Iraq in a sustainable situation——
The President. Yes, I do.
Q. ——at the end of your administration. Can you describe for us specifically, what do you mean by sustainable? Do you have specific goals and objectives that, in your mind, would meet the criteria of sustain-ability?
The President. Yes, which is to keep enough troops there so we can succeed. And David Petraeus will come as—for example, David Petraeus will come back, along with Ryan Crocker, here later on this spring and will make a recommendation as to what that—what those troop levels ought to be.
The idea of having a request by the Iraqi Government for a long-term security agreement is part of sustainability. And obviously, we're going to be pushing hard at the same time to get the political process moving forward.
I don't know if you noticed yesterday, but it was a very interesting moment in Iraqi constitutional history, when part of the—a member of the Presidency Council utilized his constitutional right to veto one of the three pieces of legislation recently passed. I understand the use of the veto, intend to continue to use it, and I—but I thought it was a healthy sign that the people are thinking through the legislation that's passed, and they're worrying about making sure that laws are constitutional. And I feel pretty good about the fact that they're, of course, going to continue to work to make sure that their stated objective of getting Provincial elections done by October of 2008 will happen.
So there's going to be a lot of work. My only point is, sustainability is political, economic, and security.
Yes, Ed [Edwin Chen, Bloomberg News].
Monetary Policy
Q. Good morning, sir.
The President. Yes, thank you.
Q. If I could get back to the economy— the GDP numbers today show that the— our economy is increasingly relying on U.S. exports to keep growing. How important is a competitive dollar in keeping U.S. exports strong and growing?
The President. We believe in a strong dollar policy, and we believe that—and I believe that our economy has got the fundamentals in place for us to be a—is to grow and continue growing more robustly, hopefully, than we're growing now. And the dollar—the value of the dollar will be reflected in the ability for our economy to be—to grow economically. And so we're still for a strong dollar.
Q. Can I follow up on that, sir?
Price of Gasoline/Taxes/Energy The President. Maybe.
Q. Thanks.
The President. I guess you are. Yes, I haven't said yes, but please. [Laughter]
Q. What's your advice to the average American who is hurting now, facing the prospect of four-dollar-a-gallon gasoline, a lot of people facing——
The President. Wait a minute. What did you just say? You're predicting four-dollara-gallon gasoline?
Q. A number of analysts are predicting——
The President. Oh, yeah?
Q. ——four-dollar-a-gallon gasoline this spring when they reformulate.
The President. That's interesting. I hadn't heard that.
Q. Yes, sir.
The President. Yes. I know it's high now.
Q. And the other economic problems facing people—beyond your concern that you stated here and your expectations for these stimulus checks, what kind of hope can you offer to people who are in dire straits?
The President. Permanent tax—keep the tax cuts permanent, for starters. There's a lot of economic uncertainty. You just said that. You just said the price of gasoline may be up to $4 a gallon—or some expert told you that—and that creates a lot of uncertainty. If you're out there wondering whether or not—you know, what your life is going to be like and you're looking at $4 a gallon, that's uncertain. And when you couple that with the idea that your taxes may be going up in a couple of years, that's double uncertainty. And therefore, one way to deal with uncertainty is for Congress to make the tax cuts permanent.
Secondly, it's—people got to understand that our energy policies needs to be focused on a lot of things: one, renewables, which is fine, which I strongly support, as you know; two, conservation. But we need to be finding more oil and gas at home if we're worried about becoming independent—dependent on oil overseas. And this—I view it as a transitory period to new technologies that'll change the way we live. But we haven't built a refinery in a long time. We're expanding refineries, but we haven't built a refinery in a long time. I strongly suggested to the Congress that we build refineries on old military bases, but no, it didn't pass. But if you've got less supply of something as demand continues to stay steady or grow, your price is going to go up.
Secondly, on oil, we—the more oil we find at home, the better off we're going to be in terms of the short run. And yet our policy is, you know, let us not explore robustly in places like ANWR. And there are environmental concerns, and I understand that. I also know there's technologies that should mitigate these environmental concerns.
They got a bill up there in Congress now. Their attitude is, let's tax oil companies. Well, all that's going to do is make the price even higher. We ought to be encouraging investment in oil and gas close to home if we're trying to mitigate the problems we face right now.
And so yes, there's a lot of uncertainty, and I'm concerned about the uncertainty. Hopefully, this progrowth package will help—this 100—I think it's $147 billion that will be going out the door, starting electronically in the first week of May and through check in the second week of May. And the idea is to help our consumers deal with the uncertainty you're talking about. But yes, no question about it, it's a difficult period.
Yes, Ken [Ken Herman, Cox News].
Presidential Library
Q. Thank you, sir. Now that you've found a location for your Presidential library, you've got to find the money to build it. Reports indicate that you may be trying to collect as much as $200 million. Is that figure accurate? Do you believe it's important for the American people to know who is giving that kind of money to their President? Will you disclose the contributions as they come in? And will you place any restriction on who gives money and how much they can give?
The President. No, yes, no, yes. [Laughter] Next question. [Laughter] I haven't— phew, man. You obviously haven't asked a question in a long time. It was like, you know, one, I haven't seen the final budget. Two, as Donnie Evans said, who is the chairman of the foundation, we'll look at the disclosure requirements and make a decision. Here's the—well, I—there's a lot of people—or some people; I shouldn't say a lot—some people who like to give and don't particularly want their names disclosed, whether it be for this foundation or any other foundation. And so we'll take that into consideration.
Thirdly—and what was the other?
Q. Any restrictions on who can give? Will you take foreign money for this?
The President. Yes, I'll probably take some foreign money, but don't know yet, Ken. We just haven't—we just announced the deal, and I frankly have been focused elsewhere, like on gasoline prices and, you know, my trip to Africa, and haven't seen the fundraising strategy yet. And so the answer to your question—really, I can't answer your question well.
Q. Where does the people's right to know this fit into all of that?
The President. You know, I don't—we're weighing, taking a look, taking consideration, giving it serious consideration. Nice try, though.
2008 Beijing Olympics/China/Human Rights
Olivier [Olivier Knox, Agence France-Presse].
Q. Thank you, sir. In China, a former factory worker who says that human rights are more important than the Olympics is being tried for subversion. What message does it send that you're going to the Olympics? And do you think athletes there should be allowed to publicly express their dissent?
The President. Olivier, I have made it very clear, I'm going to the Olympics because it's a sporting event, and I'm looking forward to seeing the athletic competition. But that will not preclude me from meeting with the Chinese President, expressing my deep concerns about a variety of issues, just like I do every time I meet with the President.
And maybe I'm in a little different position. Others don't have a chance to visit with Hu Jintao, but I do. And every time I meet with him, I talk about religious freedom and the importance of China's society recognizing that if you're allowed to worship freely, it will benefit the society as a whole; that the Chinese Government should not fear the idea of people praying to a god as they see fit. A whole society, a healthy society, a confident society is one that recognizes the value of religious freedom.
I talk about Darfur and Iran and Burma. And so I am not the least bit shy of bringing up the concerns expressed by this factory worker. And I believe that I'll have an opportunity to do so with the President and, at the same time, enjoy a great sporting event. I'm a sports fan. I'm looking forward to the competition. And each Olympic society will make its own decision as to how to deal with the athletes.
Yes, Mark [Mark Smith, Associated Press Radio].
Price of Oil/Tax Breaks for Oil Companies/ Energy
Q. Mr. President, back to the oil price— tax breaks that you were talking about a minute ago. Back when oil was $55 a barrel, you said those tax breaks were not needed; people had plenty of incentive to drill for oil. Now the price of oil is $100 a barrel, and you're planning to threaten a plan that would shift those tax breaks to renewables. Why, sir?
The President. I talked, Mark—I talked about some of the breaks. And this is a— this generally is a tax increase, and it doesn't make any sense to do it right now. We need to be exploring for more oil and gas. And taking money out of the coffers of the oil companies will make it harder for them to reinvest. I know they say, well, look at all of the profits. Well, we're raising the price of gasoline in a time when the price of gasoline is high.
Secondly, we've invested a lot of money in renewables. This administration has done more for renewables than any President. Now, we got a problem with renewables, and that is, the price of corn is beginning to affect food—cost of food, and it's hurting hog farmers and a lot of folks. And the best way to deal with renewables is to focus on research and development that will enable us to use other raw material to produce ethanol. I'm a strong believe in ethanol, Mark. This administration has got a great record on it. But it is a—I believe research and development is what's going to make renewable fuels more effective.
Again, I repeat: If you look at what's happened in corn out there, you're beginning to see the food issue and the energy issue collide. And so, to me, the best dollar spent is to continue to deal with cellulosic ethanol in order to deal with this bottleneck right now. And secondly, the tax—yes, I said that a while ago, on certain aspects. But the way I analyze this bill is, it's going to cost the consumers more money. And we need more oil and gas being explored for; we need more drilling; we need less dependence on foreign oil.
And as I say, we're in a period of transition here in America, from a time where we were—where we are oil and gas dependent to, hopefully, a time where we got electric automobiles, and we're spending money to do that; a time when we're using more biofuels, and we've taken huge investments in that; a time when we've got nuclear power plants and we're able to deal with the disposal in a way that brings confidence to the American people—so we're not dependent on natural gas to fire up our—a lot of our utilities and a time when we can sequester coal.
That's where we're headed for, but we've got to do something in the interim. Otherwise, we're going to be dealing, as the man said, with four-dollar gasoline. And so that's why I'm against that bill.
I thank you. It's been a pleasure. Enjoyed being with you.
Q. Sir, do you think Hillary Clinton is the nominee?
The President. Pardon me?
Q. Do you still think Hillary Clinton will be the nominee?
The President. I'm not talking about politics.
Q. You've said that before, though.
The President. You're trying to get me to be pundit in chief.
Q. Are they qualified to be Commander in Chief?
The President. I appreciate you very— Jackson [David Jackson, USA Today]—Jackson. Nice to see you. [Laughter] Thank you.
Q. Thank you.
The President. Glad to see you back. [Laughter]"
"April 22, 2008",The President's News Conference With President Felipe de Jesus Calderon Hinojosa of Mexico and Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada in New Orleans,George W. Bush,"George W. Bush, The President's News Conference With President Felipe de Jesus Calderon Hinojosa of Mexico and Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada in New Orleans Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/277462",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-felipe-de-jesus-calderon-hinojosa-mexico-2,"President Bush. Thank you all. Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, welcome to the great city of New Orleans. Thank you all for coming as well. New Orleans is one of America's really top cities. And they, the people of New Orleans, appreciate the help you gave them right after Hurricane Katrina, and so I want to thank you very much for that. New Orleans has always been a crossroads for our continent. And today, there's no better place for our nations to look forward to a bright future, and that's what we're here to do.
I—one of the things our—you know, people ask, well, does it make sense for Mexico, Canada, and the United States to meet? Absolutely, it makes sense. We're neighbors. A prosperous neighborhood is in our interests; a secure neighborhood is in our interests. And we share common values. So I'm not surprised we've had good meetings. Plus, we like each other. It's easy to work with leaders who are straightforward and honest, tell you what's on their mind, and who care deeply about the people of their countries and who are problem-solvers. And that's how I have found this meeting and the previous meetings we've held.
We talked about trade. Mexico, Canada, and the United States made a bold decision in the early 1990s. Our countries decided to reduce our trade barriers through the North American Free Trade Agreement. That was a visionary move by previous leaders, a move that has benefited all three of our countries a lot. Trade has tripled. Our economies have grown by more than 50 percent.
Now is not the time to renegotiate NAFTA or walk away from NAFTA. Now is the time to make it work better for all our people. And now is the time to reduce trade barriers worldwide.
And so we spent time talking about the Colombia free trade agreement. Canada is negotiating a Colombia free trade agreement. Mexico has a free trade agreement with Colombia. And a lot of folks are waiting for the United States Congress to bring this issue up and pass it. It makes no sense to me to say that Colombia goods can come into our country duty free, yet our goods can't go into Colombia duty free. And yet that's the case.
An agreement with Colombia would level the playing field, and a failure to pass an agreement would send a terrible signal to our neighborhood. The Speaker of the United States Congress has killed this bill unless she gives us a date certain for a vote. It is a bad decision on her part, and it's bad for our hemisphere to have the United States of America turn its back on a mutual friend like Colombia.
We're working to make sure we reduce regulations and to add—to make sure that our small businesses and farmers and producers are able to move product in a way without a bunch of government regulations in between. And it's not easy work, because obviously we want to maintain high standards and work for good safety precautions. Yet we're making progress.
And we've charged others to continue to work; like, Carlos Gutierrez and my Cabinet will work on issues with his counterparts for more harmonized standards to reduce the cost of producing cars and trucks throughout our entire market. In other words, you've got different regulations in different countries that make it difficult to compete globally and cause our products to be more expensive than they should be.
We're talking about food and product safety standards to make them compatible in a way that guarantees safety for our consumers. We talked about the need for us to work together to promote clean, efficient, low-carbon energy technologies. Obviously, we talked about global warming and the need to make sure that major economies are all party to an agreement.
People say, well, are you really committed to global—to reducing global warming? Absolutely. As a matter of fact, I gave a speech in the Rose Garden the other day that made it abundantly clear the United States is for an effective climate agreement that includes binding commitments from all major developed and developing economies, and we'll continue to work toward that end.
And then obviously, we're still working to make sure our borders work well. I mean, there's complications on these long borders. I understand that. We're making progress addressing problems and, at the same time, making sure that our people are safe.
For example, we've had an issue with Mexico. The last time—the time before last we met, the President made it abundantly clear that he felt the United States ought to do more to prevent guns from going into the—from the United States into Mexico. I couldn't agree more with him. And we put a process in place that do a variety of things, all aiming to make sure that our neighbors and our neighborhood isn't scourged by these thugs who use guns out of the United States to hold their people hostage, hold the country hostage. And so we've got a lot of tough work to do, but we're doing it.
And finally, in terms of just bilateral relations with Mexico, the Merida project is an important project to help implement a dual strategy to deal with crime and drugs. The President and I have talked about this initiative in a way that benefits the people of Mexico and the United States. The initiative conclude—includes a commitment this year of $550 million by the United States. And Congress needs to pass the deal—pass the bill. And they need to pass it in such a way that it conforms to the strategy that the President of Mexico thinks will best help deal with this issue.
All in all, it's been a very—it's been a good summit. And I appreciate you all coming. New Orleans is a fun town. I'm looking at the press corps to make sure that they didn't take advantage of it. [Laughter] You look well rested.
Anyway, it's a great place. I'm glad you're here. Thanks for coming.
Mr. President.
President Calderon Hinojosa. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, President Bush, my friends from the media, from the press, Prime Minister Harper. First of all, I'd like to thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to thank President Bush and the people of the United States for your hospitality. I think that the city of New Orleans has been an ideal venue for this leaders' summit.
And I'd like to say that I congratulate the people of Louisiana for their determination, for their strength. I congratulate the people of the United States, as well, for the recovery they've shown after the effects of Hurricane Katrina. And I repeat that Americans can always count on the solidarity of Mexicans during times of tragedy as a result of, in this case, a natural phenomenon.
I'm pleased because the meeting allowed President Bush, Prime Minister Harper, and myself to work on an agenda that was devoted to improving the welfare of our peoples. President Bush already mentioned some of the issues we talked about. I would simply underscore the following.
First, we reasserted commitments we adopted in Montebello last year, such as that of strengthening the competitiveness of our region, cooperation in the area of imports, products from other areas of North America, food security, and also improving the situation of all the regulation among our three countries. And our Secretary will be spearheading the work on the Mexican side in order to deregulate measures affecting trade.
Second, we talked a lot about the NAFTA, and of course, we agreed that this is not the time to even think about amending it or canceling it. This is the time to strengthen and reinvigorate this free trade agreement among our three countries. Thanks to the free trade agreement, trade exchange went beyond $900 trillion, behind which we have jobs; we have investment; we have goods and services that improve the quality of life of Canadians, Americans, and Mexicans. And we want these benefits to reach more and more of all our citizens.
Third, we agreed on the need to strengthen investments and cooperation among all our nations. And the business leaders of the three countries gave us a very specific agenda that records the progress we've made and also establishes how much more quickly we need to work within the North American Competitiveness Council, where the three leaders agreed we fully need to support the work of this Competitiveness Council.
Fourth, we recognized the progress made within the regulatory framework that's compatible for all three countries.
Fifth, we agreed that the efforts we've made in the area of intellectual property have transferred to major hits against smuggling and the work of pirates. In the case of Mexico, for example, last year, we carried out the biggest seizures in the history of our country. And in fact, last night we had some major efforts carried out against organized crime. And the three countries will continue to work on improving the conditions of law enforcement.
Six, we also talked a lot about border projects. Our three countries want to have safe borders, and we want to have efficient borders, borders that will improve the competitiveness of our various businesses and for the entire region. We talked about how to make the flow along the borders even better, how to improve trade there.
Of course, there are issues of interest between Canada and the United States. They're working on those issues. In the case of Mexico, we are working very hard on how to expand the border crossings between Mexico and the United States with projects that are already in course: ones in Reynosa, others in Juarez and different points across the border.
We also exchanged viewpoints on the issues that have to do with security in the region. And in this case, we talked to President Bush about the Merida Initiative, an initiative that is focused on facing a joint strategy with regard to a joint—a common enemy, which is organized crime, which operates on both sides of the border and which does not recognize any borders, any limits. And unfortunately, it affects Mexican, Canadian, and U.S. families.
It's very important for our Congresses and Parliaments in our respective countries to strengthen, support the decisive actions that we are carrying out in order to eradicate this scourge that is affecting all of North America.
We also stressed the need to continue to promote growth and development in our entire region. Throughout the continent, and especially in Mexico, we're concerned about Latin America. That's why it's important for this cooperative and collaborative mechanism among the United States, Canada, and Mexico to work. And that's why we also need to redouble the successful cases where trade and cooperation are fruitful and lead to tangible results for our people.
I want to talk about the efforts being made in this country to establish free trade agreements that are much more practical and beneficial for everyone, in particular, the one under discussion now in the U.S. Congress between the United States and Colombia. It's extremely important, I think, to bear in mind that when you provide more opportunities for trade in the Latin American region, there will be many more opportunities for prosperity. And it needs to be made very clear that the prosperity of Latin America, and particularly that of Mexico, is a crucial factor for the prosperity of the people of North America.
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I'm convinced, and after this meeting even more so, that after 14 years of a very decisive step, which was the North American Free Trade Agreement, today, the relations between the United States, Canada, and Mexico is more dynamic, more fluid, much more successful than ever before.
In particular, I want to thank President Bush for his leadership in holding not just this meeting here in the United States but the fact that these meetings were established in the year 2005. And President Bush's leadership has been very important for these meetings to be held among the three countries, which don't just affect the leaders attending the meetings themselves but allow all of us to coordinate our policies, our activities, and our objectives in order to ensure greater regional prosperity.
This is the last meeting for President Bush. From now on, the veteran for these meetings is going to be Prime Minister Harper. And I'm sure that whoever the next President of the United States will be, he or she will continue with this regional effort. Independently of the fact that, unfortunately, President Bush will not be with us, we have at least informally invited him to our next meeting personally.
And I'd like to announce formally, on behalf of the Mexican Government, that we have conveyed to the Governments of the United States and Canada a very special invitation to take part at the next leaders' summit of 2009 to be held in Mexico. And of course, from now on, we will be preparing to make sure the summit is memorable and productive, a summit that will offer the taste of the hospitality of the people of Mexico and will also allow us to reach various specific decisions on a number of issues which, as we have shown at this meeting, have been very carefully analyzed. And the options for the North American Competitiveness Council and the three administrations is very clear.
I hope that we will continue have an even more prosperous North American region, a region where the United States, Canada, and Mexico will gain in competitiveness vis-a-vis other regions of the world which are now leading in terms of growth and productivity. But I'm sure that we can achieve this, especially if we persevere with the good will that has been demonstrated at this New Orleans meeting.
Thank you so much, Mr. President, and thank you to the American people.
Prime Minister Harper. This is the last— we talked about common stakes for our three countries. President Bush, myself, and—we have discussed about commerce and the advantages that NAFTA brings to our three countries and has been doing for 14 years. We talked about the progress that we've made, and we have talked about not only what has been done, but also what needs to be done.
We concluded that it's essential for the prosperity of our countries to continue this effort. And we have emphasized in particular the border crossing, Windsor-Detroit. It is evident that a greater North American cooperation will lead to the creation of jobs and will allow us to compete in a very effective way to other emerging commercial blocs around the world.
I would like—also talked about our concern about the thickening of the border between our countries. The Chambers of Commerce of the United States and Canada are concerned about these border issues for several years. And the council for competitiveness has also talked about their concern about this border issues.
It was a great pleasure to come to New Orleans for this summit. And of course, I want to thank President Bush and the population of New Orleans for their great hospitality. And I'm looking forward to see President Calderon, who will greet us in Mexico and welcome us to Mexico next year.
[At this point, Prime Minister Harper continued in English.]
President Bush, President Calderon, and I have discussed the common issues and challenges facing our three countries. We discussed the importance of cooperation on security and trade and the benefits that NAFTA has produced for each of our three countries over the last 14 years.
We also talked about the progress we've made and are continuing to make to improve North American security. We agreed that continuing to improve and expand trade is the key to greater prosperity for our peoples, and we are putting special emphasis on the Detroit-Windsor crossing.
It's clear that greater North American cooperation is our best option to create jobs and to compete effectively with emerging trading blocs elsewhere in the world. To that end, I specifically raised concerns about the so-called thickening of the Can-ada-U.S. border. The Canadian and American Chambers of Commerce have been worried about this for several years, and the North American Competitiveness Council raised their concerns at our meeting this morning.
It has been a pleasure to come to New Orleans for this summit. I—my only regret, Mr. President, is that I didn't bring my wife and decide to spend a lot more time here. But it's been wonderful to visit here, to see the rebuilding. I won't say my farewells, because you and I have a few more meetings, including the G-8 this summer, that we're looking forward to.
I also look forward to seeing you, President Calderon, in the future—and for your offer to host us next year. And I can tell you, Canadians are always delighted to visit Mexico in the wintertime, so keep that in mind. [Laughter]
President Calderon Hinojosa. Thank you.
President Bush. Okay, a couple of questions.
Trade/2008 Presidential Election/MexicoCanada-U.S. Relations
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to follow up on your comments about NAFTA. The Democratic Presidential candidates, in fact, are talking about renegotiating that trade agreement if elected. I'm wondering if you're worried that their comments on the campaign trail are perhaps overshadowing your protrade agenda. In essence, do you worry that you're losing the free trade debate in the courts of public opinion?
And to President Calderon and Prime Minister Harper, I'd like to get your thoughts about expanding your trade relationship with the United States. Is there a point at which you shift attention to the people running for the White House and their views and try to reach out to them?
President Bush. Actually, my biggest concern on trade right now is with Colombia. NAFTA exists, and NAFTA—when you analyze it in an objective way, it benefits— beneficial to America. It also happens to be beneficial to Mexico and Canada, which makes it a, you know, a very good, comprehensive agreement.
It's beneficial to us because when you're able to export to your neighborhood, it helps create jobs. Jobs are created when people find outlets for their goods and services. We have found a lot of outlets for our goods and services with our—in our neighborhood. It also helps consumers when you import. In other words, the more choices consumers have, the more options they have, the more—less likely it is there will be price increases, and it's better for your consumers. This agreement's been beneficial in creating wealth in our neighborhood. Our economies have all grown.
I also happen to think it's very important for our citizens. I wish people could remember what the border looked like between Texas and Mexico before NAFTA. I mean, it was poor, really poor, on both sides of the border. If you go down there today, there's prosperity on both sides of the border, and that's in our Nation's interests.
I mean, one way to increase pressure on the border is to—if you do it—away with NAFTA, there's going to be a lot of Mexicans—more Mexicans out of work. It will make it harder on the border. It will make it harder to deal with. So people who say, ""Let's get rid of NAFTA,"" because of a throwaway political line, must understand this has been good for America, and it's also been good for Mexico and Canada, and that's what you want in your neighborhood.
Secondly, my biggest concern is to turn our back on our friends in Colombia. The Speaker of the House made a decision, using an extraordinary procedure, to prevent a vote on a trade bill that had been negotiated in good faith between our respective countries. You heard the—President Calderon say, it's in the region's interest to trade freely and fairly. Well, this agreement we have with Colombia right now is not fair for America, it's not fair for our businesses, it's not fair for our farmers. And all I'm asking the Congress is to make it fair.
And if they—if the Speaker doesn't bring—give us a date certain on the bill, she's effectively killed it. It's her responsibility, and she's going to have to explain why the voices of false populism have been strengthened, why anti-Americanism could flourish, when America turns its back on a strong leader like President Uribe and a friend for democracy like President Uribe.
I'm concerned about protectionism in America. It's not in our interests to become a protectionist nation. And so I'll continue to speak out on it and assure our friends that we will work hard to explain to the people the benefits of why free and fair trade is in our Nation's interest.
President Calderon Hinojosa. First of all, what we have to do—all of us who have responsibilities vis-a-vis our citizens—is to objectively study the facts. What's happened with NAFTA in our three countries? Before NAFTA, there were many businesses, Mexican businesses, that were afraid, and they alleged that it was impossible to compete with the sophisticated and modern U.S. companies. And they weren't going to survive. There were also many U.S. companies who thought it was impossible to compete in more open markets. Now, what was the result? The result has been that trade has grown, and that has led to gains for everyone involved.
Contrary to what they believe—that one was going to win, the other would lose— it was a win-win situation, and NAFTA has benefited the three countries. Trade has grown in all three, jobs have grown in all three, and even wage levels have gone up in all three. Today, the economies of Canada, Mexico, and the United States are bigger and stronger than they were 14 years ago. Income per capita for all three has also grown compared to 14 years ago. The benefits are visible, and all you need to do is to talk based on demonstrated results.
To talk about taking a step backwards, in terms of free trade in the case of Mexico, would effectively provoke considerable damage on the economy. And another factor I was discussing yesterday with President Bush—that he reiterated today, and I will reiterate as well—would be a sudden loss of economic opportunities that would even lead to even greater migratory pressure in the—against—with the United States.
We are doing everything we can in order to create job opportunities in Mexico for people so that Mexicans will not need to seek job opportunities outside their country. And the only way to do it is by creating jobs in Mexico, and the only way is, precisely, multiplying our possibilities of trade.
In the case of the U.S. economy, if you were to take a step backwards with regard to NAFTA or free trade, you would be condemning Americans to have one of the least competitive economies in the developed world. While other parts of the world are accelerating their growth, their integration—China, Japan, India, Asia—in order to have more competitive economies and more complementary situations—and Europe is already becoming a single trade group, and they're adding more and more countries to that bloc every year—here you see protectionist voices arising. And the only thing they would achieve, if they were to prosper, would be to condemn North America as a region to complete backwardness in today's world. And that is the worst possible solution you can provide to your citizens.
It is not my role to talk to the three candidates or precandidates to the Presidency. I'm very respectful of the domestic politics of this country. This is a decision that is solely in the hands of U.S. citizens. And for that reason, I must respect that process completely. It is not my role to talk to any candidates or precandidates. All I would do is speak to the person who will eventually be the President of the United States. And we will speak openly and sincerely about the future of both of our countries or, in this case, our three countries in the trilateral meetings that we hold.
But Mexico will have a respectful relationship with the next President of the United States and will always seek the prosperity of our nations, knowing that through free trade, we have a clear, open, and respectful relationship among all our countries that will achieve prosperity.
If we want to solve common problems, if we want to solve problems like security, problems like immigration, problems like economic growth in the United States and in Mexico, we need to understand that only to the extent that North America is more competitive as a region, only to that extent will we be able to successfully face our problems.
Prime Minister Harper. We have been working with the current U.S. administration. We've had a very productive relationship with President Bush and his administration. And I trust that this will continue, that it will continue with any of the Presidential candidates here in the United States.
Of course, it's the United States who needs to make a decision about this election. But I think that in the end, Canada really is confident that the next President will also understand the importance of NAFTA and the importance of the commercial relationship between the United States and Canada. And I must emphasize that for energy security, the commercial relationship between our two countries is even more important today than it was 20 years ago. And I think this relationship will be even more important in the future.
[Prime Minister Harper continued in English.]
——productive relationship with the current administration, and I anticipate that Canada will have a very productive relationship with the next administration, because I'm confident that when the facts are looked at, any President, just as any Prime Minister of Canada, will quickly conclude how critically important NAFTA and our North American/Canadian-American trade relations are to jobs and prosperity on both sides of our border and, in particular, the importance of energy security that is a particularly critical part of the NAFTA arrangement.
Canada is the biggest and most stable supplier of energy to the United States in the world. That energy security is more important now than it was 20 years ago, when NAFTA was negotiated, and will be even more important in the future.
Mexican Government
Q. Yes, good afternoon. I'd like to ask a domestic question but hear from Mexico. President Calderon, I'd like to ask your ideas about the situation in our Congress and also the spot that was presented lately on the statements made by Mr. Lopez Obrador and comparisons with Hitler and Mussolini. What is your opinion of this? And do you think that this helps the unity you've always called for among Mexicans, with regard to the presentation of the bill on energy in our Mexican Congress?
President Calderon Hinojosa. This kind of attitude can only be compared to the people who are making it. Congress is working normally. There is a responsible attitude on the part of most of the political parties represented therein. People from the PRI, the PAN, the Green Party, the New Alliance, other political parties are working firmly. And I simply deplore this attitude, which only impoverishes the image of those behind it and weakens even more the presence of Mexicans from parties as important as the PRD, which, aside from their own internal crisis, are losing their public image because of the activities of people who simply make them look ridiculous.
I hope that our institutional life will be strengthened and that we strengthen dialogue and the capacity for talking among ourselves.
This issue that you referred to is already in the hands of the authorities. And I'm sure that a new electoral authority, like the IFE, will make a decision according to what it seems—it deems fit based on those TV spots you referred to.
Canadian Campaign Finance Regulations
Q. Prime Minister, if you would respond in both official languages: Canadians have seen the RCMP visit to your party headquarters, they've heard the allegations from Elections Canada, and they're wondering what's going on. Did you know about this scheme, and will you practice it again in the next election?
Prime Minister Harper. Well, this is the same story as before. As you know, Elections Canada view is that some of our local spending should count as national spending. We have a different view. We looked into this at the time, and that's the view we've taken.
Our position is always that we always follow the law as we understand it, and, more importantly, we always follow the law as it has been interpreted. We were following, in the last election, the interpretations that had been put on that law in the past. If those interpretations change, we'll, of course, conform, but we will expect the same rules for every single party.
[Prime Minister Harper continued in French, and his remarks were translated as follows.]
And as I just said, it's always the same thing in this for quite awhile. Elections Canada think that some of our local expenditures should at—should be considered as national expenses. But we do not agree with that, and that's why we went to court with this issue. And in the end, we will respect the law and the interpretations of the law as they are, as we have done in the past.
Price of Gasoline/Energy/U.S. Economy
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Oil prices today rose above $118 a barrel. It's another record. Are Saudi Arabia and other oil producers, are they our adversaries, or have you had any success with your recent appeals with them? And also, the effect of the gasoline prices, isn't that about to erase or certainly erode the benefit of the economic stimulus package?
President Bush. Yes, no question, rising gasoline prices are like a tax on our working people. And what's happening is, is that we've had an energy policy that neglected hydrocarbons in the United States for a long period of time, and now we're paying the price. We should have been exploring for oil and gas in ANWR, for example. But no, we made the decision: Our Congress kept preventing us from opening up new areas to explore in environmentally friendly ways, and now we're becoming, as a result, more and more dependent on foreign sources of oil. Fortunately, Canada and Mexico are our biggest providers, for which we are grateful. But our energy policy is— wasn't effective over the past decades, and now we're paying"," the price.
And secondly, there's not a lot of excess capacity in the world. As a matter of fact, unfortunately, a lot of the supplies are coming from parts of the world where there's political instability. Fortunately, again, Canada and Mexico are not included in that group. There are some countries that are not reinvesting in their reserves, which decline without maintenance.
And so I'm obviously concerned for our consumers. All the more reason to have passed a rebate, tax relief, and all the more reason for the United States Congress to keep the tax relief I passed permanent. We got people out there campaigning: ""Well, we're just going to tax the rich."" You can't raise enough money to meet their spending appetites by taxing the so-called rich. Every one of those so-called tax-the-rich schemes end up taxing the middle class families. And in a time of economic uncertainty, we need tax certainty. In a time of rising gasoline prices, we need to be sending a message to all Americans: We're not going to raise your taxes.
Global Economy/Colombia
Q. Good afternoon, gentlemen. For President Bush, how deep and how long will the economic recession be in the United States, and how will it affect Mexico?
And what is your perspective, Mr. President, of the reform presented by President Calderon in Mexico?
And for all three of you, what's the security context that exists with regard to what's happening to NAFTA and the FTA with Colombia after Colombia carried out a military invasion in Ecuador?
President Bush. First of all, I—we're not in a recession, we're in a slowdown. We grew in the fourth quarter of last year. We haven't had first-quarter growth statistics yet, but there's no question, we're in a slowdown. And yes, people are concerned about it, obviously. I'm—of all the three of us standing up here, I'm probably the most concerned about the slowdown. After all, it's affecting the people who I have the honor of representing.
That's why we passed, in working with the Congress, a significant progrowth economic package that will pass back rebates to our citizens, starting in the second week of May. Part of that package also included incentives for large and small businesses to invest in the year 2008. I think this is going to have a positive effect on the economy. Experts say it's going to have a positive effect on the economy. And so we'll see what happens there. The key is for Congress not to raise taxes during this period of time and send a signal that they're not going to raise taxes.
You know, the President is plenty capable of handling reform. She's a—he's a good, honest man who cares deeply about the people of Mexico. And he'll do what he thinks is right for the country of Mexico.
And in terms of President Uribe, we got no better friend in South America than President Uribe. He believes strongly in rule of law. He's a reformer, and he's working hard to protect his country from a bunch of narcotraffickers who murder innocent people to achieve their objectives. And he ought to have our support. He has the support of the United States of America in many ways, but if we don't agree to a free trade agreement that we honest— negotiated in good faith with them, it will undermine his efforts, and it will destabilize parts of the world. And it would be a big mistake for the Congress to turn its back on Colombia.
President Calderon Hinojosa. I simply want to stress the measures Mexico is adopting before this situation—this slowdown of economic growth in the United States, which obviously affects us. More than 82 percent of our exports go to the United States, and we're adopting a number of measures. One of them is a very aggressive program for public expenditure and infrastructure, not just private spending. To give you an idea, Mexico is going from spending 3 percentage points of the GDP per year on infrastructure to over 51⁄2 percent of the GDP on infrastructure.
We're talking about Mexico this year having expenses for infrastructural programs of about $500 billion for private-public programs. That's already showing up in the figures of the first quarter of the year.
We're also working on an anticyclic program with very aggressive tax stimulus package for investment in the poorest regions of Mexico, where whoever invests there will get a 100-percent deduction on all investments, and the Federal Government, for a year and a half, will pay all expenses associated with social security, with labor—all the labor costs associated with social security. And that's a very, very strong stimulus package.
The first data coming in indicates that for Mexico, our economic activity had 4.25percent growth rate per year. The figures for February and March indicate that industrial activity continues to show about 4 percent growth. So it's a difficult time because of the enormous interconnection among our economies, but we are prepared to face the situation and at a slower place than the one we've had in the past. But we are dealing with the situation. We are moving with everything at the Government's disposal to accelerate the growth of the Mexican economy.
I hope that this situation will not continue for very long and that soon the authorities in the United States will be able to completely overcome the situation. I think that the steps taken so far by the fiscal tax monetary authorities in the United States and the Bush administration—and in general—have been appropriate. They have been the right measures, and we hope that they will very soon demonstrate effects so that we have a quick recovery among all our economies.
Prime Minister Harper. I would just say that in spite of a slowdown of the economy in Canada, the bases of our economy are stable and solid. And we have undertaken measures to ensure the continuous growth in the future.
Now, as far as the Colombia situation is concerned, Canada has negotiated a free trade agreement with Colombia. And it's important also for the United States and for Mexico to benefit from free trade avec Colombia.
Last year, in the summit, I said that Colombia can have drug trafficking with our countries without a free trade agreement, but if you want legitimate business for all our economies, we need to pursue free trade agreements with Colombia. And I said in New York a few months ago that I worry if the United States in the end refuses this agreement with Colombia.
We have important alliance in Colombia. Colombia is fighting against political violence, against the FARC. They fight against drug traffickers. And I think that a rejection of or turning our backs to such an ally as Colombia is—could create long-term problems for our countries in South America.
[Prime Minister Harper continued in English.]
——free trade agreement to have drug trade with Colombia. You're going to have that anyway. If you want to have legitimate trade and see that country progress economically, we need to have a free trade agreement. We need to have a trade agreement with countries like Colombia.
And I do worry that if the Colombian free trade agreement is rejected, particularly when that country has taken a lot of efforts to fight political violence and corruption and FARC and drug traffickers, if the United States and our allies turn their back on an important ally in this region, that that will have long-term security consequences for all of our countries in North America. So that does worry the Government of Canada.
Trade/Canada-U.S. Relations
Q. If you will allow me, I want to go back to NAFTA. NAFTA is in place for almost 15 years now. Wouldn't it be possible to improve things, perhaps, through renegotiating certain things on NAFTA? Mr. Harper, American President say there's no—we should not renegotiate NAFTA; President Bush says we should not renegotiate. What do you think, Minister?
Prime Minister Harper. We would be ready to do anything that any of our partners wants to do. If one of our partners wants to negotiate NAFTA, we'll do—we'll renegotiate. But this is not the position that we prefer—the Government of Canada. We have an agreement that worked well, that created jobs—lots of jobs in this continent, and I think that the business community is unanimous about the benefits of this agreement.
And I think that the problems that exist really call us to really, perhaps, improve or deepen NAFTA even more. And the problems also justify that we do what we need to do to have trade that works better than it does now. But the right priority is not to renegotiate something that has been decided. This is not the great challenge that we have. When we meet with businessmen and businesswomen, this is not their concern—their main concern. Their concern is in the future, not renegotiating the past. But Canada will always be ready to any possibilities that may happen.
As I said, we have a very dynamic relationship with—relations with the United States. We are the first—or the greatest exporter of energy products towards the United States. And for the United States, we are the main source of energy security for the United States. And we think that now it's even more important—this relation is even more important now than it was 20 years ago, and it will be more important even in the future. So if we have to discuss these possibilities, we'll be in a good position, but we would prefer to talk about the future than the past.
[Prime Minister Harper continued in English.]
I just said before, we'll be prepared for any possibility. The American people are going to make a decision. The future American administration may have a different view. I can just tell you, when I meet businesspeople not just from our country but from around the continent, the benefits of our NAFTA relationship are without question. And what all the focus is in our discussions is how to make it work better, how to make the borders thinner, how to make commerce flow more quickly, more freely. That's—how to make our relationship more integrated and deeper—those are the real concerns that I experience in Canada and when I deal with people who are focused on economic development in our trade partners' economies.
But look, as I said, we'll be prepared for any eventuality. Canada is the United States number-one supplier of energy. And we are a secure and stable supplier. That is of critical importance to the future of the United States. And if we had to look at this kind of an option, I think, quite frankly, we would be in even stronger position now than we were 20 years ago, and we'll be in a stronger position in the future. But my preference is not to renegotiate what we discussed in the past; it's to talk about the future. And I think that's what our respective—that's what, at least, the Canadian population wants us to do.
President Bush. Thank you, sir. Good job, Stephen."
"February 19, 2009","The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada in Ottawa, Canada",Barack Obama,"Barack Obama, The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada in Ottawa, Canada Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/286338",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-stephen-harper-canada-ottawa-canada,"President Obama. Hello, good afternoon.
Prime Minister Harper. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
[At this point, Prime Minister Harper spoke in French. He then translated his remarks into English, as follows.]
Once again, it is a great pleasure to welcome President Obama to Canada. We are deeply honored that he has chosen Canada for his first foreign visit since taking office. His election to the Presidency launches a new chapter in the rich history of Canada-U.S. relations. It is a relationship between allies, partners, neighbors, and the closest of friends, a relationship built on our shared values: freedom, democracy, and equality of opportunity, epitomized by the President himself.
Our discussions today focused on three main priorities. First, President Obama and I agree that Canada and the United States must work closely to counter the global economic recession by implementing mutually beneficial stimulus measures and by supporting efforts to strengthen the international financial system.
We concur on the need for immediate, concerted action to restore economic growth and to protect workers and families hit hardest by the recession through lowering taxes, ensuring access to credit, and unleashing spending that sustains and stimulates economic activity.
Second, President Obama and I agreed to a new initiative that will further cross-border cooperation on environmental protection and energy security. We are establishing a U.S.-Canada clean energy dialog which commits senior officials from both countries to collaborate on the development of clean energy science and technologies that will reduce greenhouse gases and combat climate change.
Third, the President and I had a productive discussion about our shared priorities for international peace and security, in particular, our commitment to stability and progress in Afghanistan.
This has been a very constructive visit, revealing to both of us a strong consensus on important bilateral and international issues. President Obama, I look forward to working with you in the months ahead to make progress on these issues and build on the long and deep friendship between our two countries and our two peoples.
President Obama. Thank you so much. Thank you. Well, it is a great pleasure to be here in Ottawa. And Prime Minister Harper and I just completed a productive and wide-ranging discussion on the many issues of common concern to the people of the United States and Canada.
I came to Canada on my first trip as President to underscore the closeness and importance of the relationship between our two nations and to reaffirm the commitment of the United States to work with friends and partners to meet the common challenges of our time. As neighbors, we are so closely linked that sometimes we may have a tendency to take our relationship for granted, but the very success of our friendship throughout history demands that we renew and deepen our cooperation here in the 21st century.
We're joined together by the world's largest trading relationship and countless daily interactions that keep our borders open and secure. We share core democratic values and a commitment to work on behalf of peace, prosperity, and human rights around the world. But we also know that our economy and our security are being tested in new ways, and the Prime Minister and I focused on several of those challenges today.
As he already mentioned, first we shared a commitment to economic recovery. The people of North America are hurting, and that is why our governments are acting. This week, I signed the most sweeping economic recovery plan in our Nation's history. Today the Prime Minister and I discussed our respective plans to create jobs and lay a foundation for growth. The work that's being done by this government to stimulate the economy on this side of the border is welcomed, and we expect that we can take actions in concert to strengthen the auto industry as well.
We know that the financial crisis is global, and so our response must be global. The United States and Canada are working closely on a bilateral basis and within the G-8 and G-20 to restore confidence in our financial markets. I discussed this with Prime Minister Harper, and we look forward to carrying that collaboration to London this spring.
Second, we are launching, as was mentioned, a new initiative to make progress on one of the most pressing challenges of our time, the development and use of clean energy. How we produce and use energy is fundamental to our economic recovery but also our security and our planet, and we know that we can't afford to tackle these issues in isolation. And that's why we're updating our collaboration on energy to meet the needs of the 21st century.
The clean energy dialog that we've established today will strengthen our joint research and development. It will advance carbon reduction technologies, and it will support the development of an electric grid that can help deliver the clean and renewable energy of the future to homes and businesses, both in Canada and the United States. And through this example and through continued international negotiations, the United States and Canada are committed to confronting the threat posed by climate change.
In addition to climate change, Prime Minister Harper and I discussed the need for strong bilateral cooperation on a range of global challenges, one of the most pressing being Afghanistan. The people of Canada have an enormous burden there that they have borne. As I mentioned in an interview prior to this visit, those of us in the United States are extraordinarily grateful for the sacrifices of the families here in Canada of troops that have been deployed and have carried on their missions with extraordinary valor. You've put at risk your most precious resource, your brave men and women in uniform, and so we are very grateful for that.
There is an enduring military mission against Al Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan and along the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan, but we also have to enhance our diplomacy and our development efforts. And we discussed this in our private meetings. My administration is undertaking a review of our policy so that we forge a comprehensive strategy in pursuit of clear and achievable goals. And as we move forward, we intend to consult very closely with the Government here in Canada to make certain that all our partners are working in the same direction.
In April, we'll have a broader dialog with our NATO allies on how to strengthen the alliance to meet the evolving security challenges around the world.
And finally, we look forward to the Summit of the Americas. My administration is fully committed to active and sustained engagement to advance the common security and prosperity of our hemisphere. We will work closely with Canada in advancing these goals and look forward to a meaningful dialog in Trinidad.
As I've said, the United States is once again ready to lead. But strong leadership depends on strong alliances, and strong alliances depend on constant renewal. Even the closest of neighbors need to make that effort to listen to one another, to keep open the lines of communication, and to structure our cooperation at home and around the world.
That's the work that we've begun here today. I'm extraordinarily grateful to Prime Minister Harper for his hospitality, his graciousness, and his leadership. And I'm looking forward to this being the start of a continued extraordinary relationship between our two countries.
Military Operations in Afghanistan
Q. Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister. I have Afghanistan questions for you both. Mr. President, General McKiernan requested 30,000 extra troops; your new order calls for 17,000. How likely is it that you will make up that difference after the review you've mentioned? And more importantly, how long can we expect all U.S. combat troops to be in Afghanistan?
And, Mr. Prime Minister, based on your discussions today, are you reconsidering the 2011 deadline for troop withdrawal, and are you also thinking about increasing economic aid to Afghanistan?
President Obama. Well, David [David Jackson, USA Today], the precise reason that we're doing a review is because I think that over the last several years, we took our eye off the ball, and there is a consensus of a deteriorating--that there is a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan. I don't want to prejudge that review. I ordered the additional troops because I felt it was necessary to stabilize the situation there in advance of the elections that are coming up. But we have 60 days of work to do. They--that review, which will be wide ranging, will then result in a report that's presented to me. And from--at that point, we will be able to, I think, provide you with some clearer direction in terms of how we intend to approach Afghanistan.
In terms of length, how long we might be there, obviously, that's going to be contingent on the strategy we develop out of this review. And I'm not prejudging that as well.
I should mention, just to preempt, or to anticipate Prime Minister Harper's--the question directed at him, that I certainly did not press the Prime Minister on any additional commitments beyond the ones that have already been made. All I did was to compliment Canada on not only the troops that are there, the 108 that have fallen as a consequence of engagement in Afghanistan, but also the fact that Canada's largest foreign aid recipient is Afghanistan. There has been extraordinary effort there, and we just wanted to make sure that we were saying thank you.
Prime Minister Harper. Just very quickly, as you probably know, it was just last year that we were able to get through Parliament a bipartisan resolution extending our military engagement in Afghanistan for an additional close to 4 years at that point. As we move forward, we anticipate an even greater engagement on economic development. That was part of the strategy that we adopted.
I would just say this--you know, obviously we're operating within a parliamentary resolution. I would just say this in terms of the United States looking at its own future engagement: We are highly appreciative of the fact the United States is going to be a partner with us on the ground in Kandahar. The goal of our military engagement, its principal goal right now beyond day-to-day security, is the training of the Afghan Army so the Afghans themselves can become responsible for their day-to-day security in that country.
I'm strongly of the view, having led--you know, as a government leader, having been responsible now for a military mission in Kandahar Province, that we are not in the long term, through our own efforts, going to establish peace and security in Afghanistan; that that job ultimately can be done only by the Afghans themselves. So I would hope that all strategies that come forward have the idea of an end date, of a transition to Afghan responsibility for security, and to greater Western partnership for economic development.
Environment
[The reporter spoke in French, and the question was translated by an interpreter.]
Q. Good day. In French for you, Mr. Harper. With regard to the environment, going beyond green technology to--how far are your two countries prepared to harmonize your strategy to reduce greenhouse gases, and how will you reconcile your approaches? They seem different when it comes to the tar sands for instance.
[The reporter then continued in English.]
For you, Mr. President, I can repeat in English. On the part of the--of the environment, beyond research, technology, and science, how far are your two countries willing to go to harmonize your strategies in terms of greenhouse gas reductions? And how can you reconcile your two approaches when they seem so different, especially considering the fact that Canada refuses to have hard caps, in part because of the oil sands?
Prime Minister Harper. Do you want me to answer first?
President Obama. Please.
[Prime Minister Harper spoke in French. He then translated his remarks into English, as follows.]
Prime Minister Harper. Briefly, first of all, really premature to talk about anything like that, anything like harmonization with the United States. The United States has not had a national dialog and debate on its own detailed approach. Obviously, that's something the President's administration will be doing.
What we have agreed to today is a dialog on clean energy, and particularly on the development of clean energy technology. Both of our governments are making large investments in things such as carbon capture and storage and other new technologies designed to fight climate change. We share our document on this clean energy dialog talks about things we can do together to improve the electricity grid in North America. There are all kinds of things we can do together, independent of any American regulatory approach, on climate change.
We will be watching what the United States does very--with a lot of interest for the obvious reasons that, as we all know, Canada has had great difficulty developing an effective regulatory regime alone in the context of a integrated continental economy. It's very hard to have a tough regulatory system here when we are competed with--competing with an unregulated economy south of the border.
So we'll be watching what the United States does. We'll be looking ourselves, for our own sake, at opportunities for harmonization to make our policies as effective as they can. And I don't think the differences are near as stark as you would suggest. When I look at the President's platform, the kind of targets his administration has laid out for the reduction of greenhouse gases are very similar to ours. You say we have intensity; they have absolute. But the truth is these are just two different ways of measuring the same thing. You can convert one to the other, if that's what you want to do.
So I'm quite optimistic. I'll be watching what's done in the United States with great interest. But I'm quite optimistic that we now have a partner on the North American continent that will provide leadership to the world on the climate change issue, and I think that's an important development.
President Obama. Well, this is not just a U.S. or a Canadian issue; this is a worldwide issue that we're going to have to confront. There are good, sound economic reasons for us to address this issue. You know, to the extent that, on both sides of the border, we can make our economies more energy efficient that saves consumers money, that saves businesses money, it has the added advantage of enhancing our energy security. And we are very grateful for the relationship that we have with Canada; Canada being one of--being our largest energy supplier.
But I think increasingly we have to take into account that the issue of climate change and greenhouse gases is something that's going to have an impact on all of us. And as two relatively wealthy countries, it's important for us to show leadership in this area. I think the clean energy dialog is an extraordinary beginning because right now there are no silver bullets to solve all of our energy problems. We're going to have to try a whole range of things, and that's why sharing technology, sharing ideas, sharing research and development is so important.
Here in Canada you have the issue of the oil sands. In the United States, we have issues around coal, for example, which is extraordinarily plentiful and runs a lot of our power plants. And if we can figure out how to capture the carbon, that would make an enormous difference in how we operate. Right now the technologies are at least not cost-effective.
So my expectation is, is that this clean energy dialog will move us in the right direction. We're not going to solve these problems overnight, as Prime Minister Harper indicated. We have to complete our domestic debate and discussion around these issues. My hope is, is that we can show leadership so that by the time the international conference takes place in Copenhagen that the United States has shown itself committed and ready to do its part.
I think the more that we can coordinate in--with Canada, as well as Mexico, a country that has already shown interest in leadership on this issue--and when I spoke to President Calderon, he indicated this is an area of interest to him--the more that, within this hemisphere, we can show leadership, I think the more likely it is that we can draw in countries like China and India, whose participation is absolutely critical for us to be able to solve this problem over the long term.
And, as Prime Minister Harper suggested, there are going to be a number of different ways to go after this problem. You know, we've suggested a cap and trade system. There are other countries who've discussed the possibilities of a carbon tax. I think there's no country on Earth that is not concerned about balancing dealing with this issue on the environmental side and making sure that, in the midst of a severe recession, that it's not having too much of an adverse impact on economic growth and employment.
So we think that we can benefit by listening and sharing ideas. And my hope is, is that we emerge from this process firmly committed to dealing with an issue that, ultimately, the Prime Minister's children and my children are going to have to live with for many years.
North American Free Trade Agreement
Q. Thank you, to both of you. I've got a question for both of you. Mr. President, on Tuesday you said that now is not the time to reopen NAFTA. But your aides said that you would be trying to convince our friends in Canada and in Mexico of the rightness of your position. So, first, did you convince our friends in Canada? And when is the right time to incorporate labor and environmental standards into the main body of NAFTA?
Second, for Prime Minister Harper. Mr. Prime Minister, is there a way for a ""Buy American"" provision to be compliant with the U.S. obligations under the World Trade Organization?
President Obama. Well, first of all, Jonathan [Jonathan Weisman, Wall Street Journal], I'm not sure that was my exact quote. I always get a little nervous about responding to quotes without me actually seeing it. I think what I said was, is that now is a time where we've got to be very careful about any signals of protectionism, because, as the economy of the world contracts, I think there's going to be a strong impulse on the part of constituencies in all countries to see if we--they can engage in ""beggar thy neighbor"" policies. And as, obviously, one of the largest economies in the world, it's important for us to make sure that we are showing leadership in the belief that trade ultimately is beneficial to all countries.
Having said that, what I also indicated was that with a NAFTA agreement that has labor provisions and environmental provisions as side agreements, it strikes me if those side agreements mean anything then they might as well be incorporated into the main body of the agreement so that they can be effectively enforced. And I think it is important, whether we're talking about our relationships with Canada or our relationships with Mexico, that all countries concerned are thinking about how workers are being treated and all countries concerned are thinking about environmental issues of the sort that Emmanuelle [Emmanuelle Latraverse, Radio-Canada] just raised earlier.
So you know, I raised this issue with Prime Minister Harper. My hope is, is that as our advisers and staffs and economic teams work this through; that there's a way of doing this that is not disruptive to the extraordinarily important trade relationships that exist between the United States and Canada.
Now you didn't ask me about the ""Buy American"" provisions, but since it relates to our recovery package, let me just reiterate--and I said this very clearly before the bill was passed and before I signed it--that I think it was very important to make sure that any provisions that were there were consonant with our obligations under WTO and NAFTA.
And I think that is what we achieved. I recognize the concerns of Canada, given how significant trade with the United States is to the Canadian economy. I provided Prime Minister Harper an assurance that I want to grow trade and not contract it. And I don't think that there was anything in the recovery package that is adverse to that goal.
Prime Minister Harper. I'll answer both questions as well. First of all, I just think it's important to reiterate that since NAFTA came into force, and more importantly since Canada signed its free trade agreement with the United States in 1988, trade agreements between our two countries have been nothing but beneficial for these two countries. There has been a massive explosion of trade. It was already the biggest trading relationship in the world; it's so much bigger now. And that trade supports, you know, countless millions of jobs.
And I don't think we should also forget the leadership that was established in that. You know, this was about the end of the cold war, and Canada and the U.S. signed the first modern generation trade agreement that really started the proliferation of these types of agreements, which really gave us the growth of the global economy.
Now, you know, I know some aspects of trade invariably cause political concerns, but nobody should think for a minute that trade between Canada and the United States is anything but a benefit between the two of us. And quite frankly, the trade challenges we face are common trade challenges. The trade challenges we face in North America are common trade challenges; they're not problems between our countries.
So I just think it's always important to keep this in mind. The President and I did have a good discussion of his concerns. You know, our position is that we're perfectly willing to look at ways we can address some of these concerns, which I understand, without, you know, opening the whole NAFTA and unraveling what is a very complex agreement. But we had a good discussion on that, and I think--I'm hopeful we'll be able to make some progress.
On the ""Buy American"" provisions--and let's also be very clear, as well, that in both WTO and NAFTA there are industries and there are ways in which--and there are levels of government at which one can have domestic preferences and purchasing policies. These things are allowed, in some cases, but they are certainly not allowed without limit. We expect the United States to adhere to its international obligations. I have every expectation, based on what the President has told me and what he's said publicly many times in the past that the United States will do just that.
But I can't emphasize how important it is that we do that. We have agreed in Canada and, you know, all the major countries of the world through the G-20, we agreed to pursue economic stimulus measures--not just to stimulate our own economies but to recognize that we have a synchronized global recession that requires policies that will not just benefit ourselves but benefit our trading partners at the same time. If we pursue stimulus packages, the goal of which is only to benefit ourselves or to benefit ourselves, worse, at the expense of others, we will deepen the world recession, not solve it.
So I think it's critical that the United States has been a leader for a long time in the goals of an open global economy. I think it's critical that that leadership continue. And I'm quite confident that the United States will respect those obligations and continue to be a leader on the need for globalized trade.
If I could just comment on our stimulus package, one of the things we did in our stimulus package was actually remove duties on some imported goods. Now, part of the reason we did that, it's in our own economic interest, but also, as well, it will help stimulate continental and global trade. And this is important for our recovery. We know as a small economy we can't recover without recovery in the United States and recovery around the world. But that's true for all of us these days.
Canada-U.S. Relations/Border Security/U.S. Auto Industry/Economic Stabilization
Q. I have a question for both of you. Mr. President, during your meetings today, did you discuss the possibility of Canada stepping up its stimulus plans? And secondly, for both of you, what do you think the Canada-U.S. relationship will look like in 4 years? What will the auto sector look like? Will the border be thicker or thinner? And will you have a carbon market?
President Obama. See, you stuffed about six questions in there. [Laughter] Were you talking to Jonathan? Is that--[laughter].
Q. I have more.
President Obama. Yes, I'll bet. Well, first of all, I'll answer your last question first. I expect that, 4 years from now, the U.S.-Canadian relationship will be even stronger than it is today. I expect that you will see increased trade. I think we will see continued integration of efforts on the--on energy in various industries, and I think that's to be welcomed.
I'm a little biased here because I've got a brother-in-law who's Canadian, and I have two of my key staff people who hail from Canada. And I love this country and think that we could not have a better friend and ally. And so I'm going to do everything that I can to make sure that our relationship is strengthened.
You mentioned a couple of specific issues, the idea of thickening of borders. One of the things that I would like to see is--and we--Prime Minister Harper and I discussed this--how we can use some of our stimulus and infrastructure spending that is already being planned around potentially easing some of these bottlenecks in our border. Now, we've got very real security concerns, as does Canada. But I think that it is possible for us to balance our security concerns with an open border that continues to encourage this extraordinary trade relationship in which we have $1.5 billion worth of trade going back and forth every single day.
With respect to the auto industry, obviously, we are concerned--we're deeply concerned about the current state of the North American auto industry. It is an integrated industry. When we provided our initial Federal help to the auto industry, Prime Minister Harper stepped up and provided assistance that was commensurate with the stake that Canada has in the auto industry.
We have just received the report back from GM and Chrysler in terms of how they intend to move forward. My economic team is in the process of evaluating it. One thing we know for certain is that there's going to have to be a significant restructuring of that industry. And as that restructuring takes place, one in which all parties involved--shareholders, creditors, workers, management, suppliers, dealers, as all of those parties come together to figure out what is a sustainable and vibrant auto--North American auto industry, it's going to be very important for our Government to coordinate closely with the Canadian Government in whatever approach that we decide to take. And we are committed to doing that.
And finally, with respect to stimulus, I think that, as Prime Minister Harper mentioned, Canada has put in place its own stimulus package. We obviously are very proud of the recovery act that I recently signed, not only because it provides a short-term boost to the economy and provides relief to families that really need help, but I think it also will lay the groundwork for long-term growth and prosperity.
We were talking earlier about the issue of the electric grid. The potential that exists for creating ways of delivering energy from wind and solar across vast plains to get to urban areas and populated areas is enormously promising. That's why we are investing billions of dollars to help jump-start that process.
And so we think we've taken the right approach to not only get the economy moving again and to fill domestic demand as well as global demand, but also I think Prime Minister Harper is taking the same approach. And to the extent that as we go to the G-20 summit, that we are saying the most significant economies in the world all taking these steps in concert, then more--the more likely we are that we're going to be able to slow the recessionary trends, reverse them, and start growing the economy again, which ultimately is the bottom line for both the Prime Minister and myself--making sure that Americans, Canadians have good jobs that pay good wages, allow them to support a family and send their kids to college, and let their children aspire to new heights.
So I think we're going to continue to coordinate as closely as possible to make sure that we are helping families on both sides of the border.
Prime Minister Harper. You did ask several questions. I'll try and touch on a few of them. On stimulus, first of all, it's important to understand that Canada's economic stimulus package is very large. It's certainly larger than the kind of numbers the IMF was talking about in the fall with the provincial action that we will bring in to our stimulus spending--will be close to 2 percent of GDP for this year, a percent and a half for next year. This is not as large as the stimulus package in the United States. But the issues in the United States are different, and in fairness, they are bigger than in Canada.
Let me just give you a concrete example of the difference; I could talk about housing, or the banking sector. But the American stimulus package contains a significant money--a significant pot of money being transferred to lower levels of government to deal with health care. Well, in Canada, as you know, we already have permanent health care transfer arrangements with our Provinces before this economic crisis, so not all of these things are directly transferable to the Canadian experience. But by any measure, ours is a very large stimulus program.
As"," the President mentioned, we talked about today how we can use our investments in infrastructure to focus specifically on border infrastructure that we share. We know well at Detroit/Windsor and elsewhere in Canada that the growth of our trade is straining our border infrastructure that's independent even of security demands. So there may be things we can do there jointly in the name of economic stimulus that are beneficial for the long term.
The statement lays out today a whole bunch of initiatives we're undertaking, and I think President Obama mentioned them. Beyond border infrastructure, we have joint action going on on the auto sector. We were working closely with the out-coming administration. We will be continuing to work with President Obama's administration on what is an integrated industry needs an integrated solution.
We are engaged in Afghanistan. We talked about that at length. We are launching a clean energy dialog on one of the most important challenges of the next decade, and that is climate change. So you know, I see a range of initiatives that will carry us forward for many years.
I do want to address two specific things, though, you raised--one is border thickening, and one is kind of 4 years from now. On the thickening of the border, I just want to make this clear--and I want to make this clear to our American friends--not only have we since 9/11 made significant investments in security and security along our border, the view of this Government is unequivocal: Threats to the United States are threats to Canada.
There is no such thing as a threat to the national security of the United States which does not represent a direct threat to this country. We as Canadians have every incentive to be as cooperative and alarmed about the threats that exist to the North American continent in the modern age as do the Government and people of the United States. That's the approach with which we treat the border. Obviously, we've been concerned about the thickening of the border.
You know, in our judgment--and we'll have some time to talk about this as--as we move along in our respective Governments. We're looking at--the key is to look at how we can deal with security in a way that does not inhibit commerce and social interaction. That is the real challenge. But let there be no--and that's where thickening of the border concerns us--but let there be no illusion about the fact that we take these security concerns as seriously as our American friends.
In terms of big picture, you know, I think this would be the safest prediction in the world: That today Canada and the United States are closer economically, socially, culturally, in terms of our international partnerships than any two nations on the face of the Earth--closer friends than any two nations on the face of the Earth. And I think we can safely predict that in 4 years time, we will be in exactly the same spot.
What we can do with that in the meantime--and what I'm sure President Obama will want to do with that--is to take that close relationship that is so deeply integrated when it comes to things like trade and military and defense considerations, things where we have not only established a close friendship, but where we have established models that others who want to pursue close friendships have used around the world--that we can take those things and we can continue to lead in the future. We can continue to show how two countries can work together in ways that pursue global cooperation and integration to mutual benefit.
And as we all know, one of President Obama's big missions is to continue world leadership by the United States of America, but in a way that is more collaborative. And I'm convinced that by working with our country, he will have no greater opportunity than to demonstrate exactly how that model can operate over the next 4 years.
President Obama. And let me just say that, to echo what the Prime Minister said, we have no doubt about Canada's commitment to security in the United States as well as Canada. Obviously, we've got long-lasting relationships around NORAD, for example, and the same is true with respect to border security. There's been extraordinary cooperation, and we expect that that will continue.
And Prime Minister Harper is right. It's a safe bet that the United States and Canada will continue to enjoy an extraordinary friendship, and together I think we've got an opportunity to show the world that the values that we care about--of democracy, of human rights, of economic growth and prosperity--that these are values that the world can embrace, and that we can show leadership. And I'm very much looking forward to working with this Government and all Canadians in order to promote these values.
I want to also, by the way, thank some of the Canadians who came over the border to campaign for me during the election. [Laughter] It was much appreciated. And I'm looking forward to coming back to Canada as soon as it warms up. [Laughter]"
"March 24, 2009",The President's News Conference,Barack Obama,"Barack Obama, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/285971",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1123,"The President. Hello, everybody. Please have a seat. Good evening. Before I take questions from the correspondents I want to give everyone who's watching tonight an update on the steps we're taking to move this economy from recession to recovery and ultimately to prosperity.
It's important to remember that this crisis didn't happen overnight, and it didn't result from any one action or decision. It took many years and many failures to lead us here, and it will take many months and many different solutions to lead us out. There are no quick fixes, and there are no silver bullets.
That's why we've put in place a comprehensive strategy designed to attack this crisis on all fronts. It's a strategy to create jobs, to help responsible homeowners, to restart lending, and to grow our economy over the long term. And we're beginning to see signs of progress.
The first step we took was to pass a recovery plan to jump-start job creation and put money in people's pockets. This plan has already saved the jobs of teachers and police officers. It's creating construction jobs to rebuild roads and bridges, and yesterday I met with a man whose company is reopening a factory outside of Pittsburgh that's rehiring workers to build some of the most energy efficient windows in the world. And this plan will provide a tax cut to 95 percent of all working families that will appear in people's paychecks by April 1st.
The second step we took was to launch a plan to stabilize the housing market and help responsible homeowners stay in their homes. This plan is one reason that mortgage interest rates are now at near-historic lows. We've already seen a jump in refinancing of some mortgages as homeowners take advantage of lower rates, and every American should know that up to 40 percent of all mortgages are now eligible for refinancing. This is the equivalent of another tax cut. And we're also beginning to see signs of increased sales and stabilizing home prices for the first time in a very long time.
The third part of our strategy is to restart the flow of credit to families and businesses. To that end, we've launched a program designed to support the market for more affordable auto loans, student loans, and small-business loans, a program that's already securitized more of this lending in the last week than in the last 4 months combined. Yesterday Secretary Geithner announced a new plan that will partner Government resources with private investment to buy up the assets that are preventing our banks from lending money. And we will continue to do whatever is necessary in the weeks ahead to ensure the banks Americans depend on have the money they need to lend even if the economy gets worse.
Finally, the most critical part of our strategy is to ensure that we do not return to an economic cycle of bubble and bust in this country. We know that an economy built on reckless speculation, inflated home prices, and maxed-out credit cards does not create lasting wealth. It creates the illusion of prosperity, and it's endangered us all.
The budget I submitted to Congress will build our economic recovery on a stronger foundation so that we don't face another crisis like this 10 or 20 years from now. We invest in the renewable sources of energy that will lead to new jobs, new businesses, and less dependence on foreign oil. We invest in our schools and our teachers so that our children have the skills they need to compete with any workers in the world. We invest in reform that will bring down the cost of health care for families, businesses, and our Government. And in this budget, we have to make the tough choices necessary to cut our deficit in half by the end of my first term, even under the most pessimistic estimates.
At the end of the day, the best way to bring our deficit down in the long run is not with a budget that continues the very same policies that have led us to a narrow prosperity and massive debt. It's with a budget that leads to broad economic growth by moving from an era of borrow and spend to one where we save and invest.
And that's why clean energy jobs and businesses will do all across America. That's what a highly skilled workforce can do all across America. That's what an efficient health care system that controls costs and entitlements like Medicare and Medicaid will do. That's why this budget is inseparable from this recovery, because it is what lays the foundation for a secure and lasting prosperity.
The road to that prosperity is still long, and we will hit our share of bumps and setbacks before it ends. But we must remember that we can get there if we travel that road as one nation, as one people. You know, there was a lot of outrage and finger-pointing last week, and much of it is understandable. I'm as angry as anybody about those bonuses that went to some of the very same individuals who brought our financial system to its knees, partly because it's yet another symptom of the culture that led us to this point.
But one of the most important lessons to learn from this crisis is that our economy only works if we recognize that we're all in this together, that we all have responsibilities to each other and to our country. Bankers and executives on Wall Street need to realize that enriching themselves on the taxpayers' dime is inexcusable, that the days of outsized rewards and reckless speculation that puts us all at risk have to be over.
At the same time, the rest of us can't afford to demonize every investor or entrepreneur who seeks to make a profit. That drive is what has always fueled our prosperity, and it is what will ultimately get these banks lending and our economy moving once more.
We'll recover from this recession, but it will take time, it will take patience, and it will take an understanding that when we all work together, when each of us looks beyond our own short-term interest to the wider set of obligations we have towards each other, that's when we succeed; that's when we prosper. And that's what is needed right now. So let's look towards the future with a renewed sense of common purpose, a renewed determination, and most importantly, a renewed confidence that a better day will come.
All right, with that, let me take some questions. And I've got a list here. Let's start off with Jennifer Loven, AP [Associated Press].
Government Role in Reforming Financial Systems
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Your Treasury Secretary and the Fed Chairman were on Capitol Hill today asking for this new authority that you want to regulate big, complex financial institutions. But given the problems that the financial bailout program has had so far--banks not wanting to talk about how they're spending the money, the AIG bonuses that you mentioned--why do you think the public should sign on for another new, sweeping authority for the Government to take over companies, essentially?
The President. Well, keep in mind that it is precisely because of the lack of this authority that the AIG situation has gotten worse. Now, understand that AIG is not a bank, it's an insurance company. If it were a bank and it had effectively collapsed, then the FDIC could step in, as it does with a whole host of banks, as it did with IndyMac, and in a structured way, renegotiate contracts, get rid of bad assets, strengthen capital requirements, resell it on the private marketplace.
So we've got a regular mechanism whereby we deal with FDIC-insured banks. We don't have that same capacity with an institution like AIG, and that's part of the reason why it has proved so problematic. I think a lot of people, understandably, say, ""Well, if we're putting all this money in there, and if it's such a big systemic risk to allow AIG to liquidate, why is it that we can't restructure some of these contracts? Why can't we do some of the things that need to be done in a more orderly way?"" And the reason is, is because we have not obtained this authority.
We should have obtained it much earlier so that any institution that poses a systemic risk that could bring down the financial system we can handle, and we can do it in an orderly fashion that quarantines it from other institutions. We don't have that power right now. That's what Secretary Geithner was talking about.
And I think that there's going to be strong support from the American people and from Congress to provide that authority so that we don't find ourselves in a situation where we've got to choose between either allowing an enormous institution like AIG, which is not just insuring other banks, but is also insuring pension funds and potentially putting people's 401(k)s at risk if it goes under; that's one choice. And then the other choice is just to allow them to take taxpayer money without the kind of conditions that we'd like to see on it.
So that's why I think the authority is so important.
Q. Why should the public trust the Government to handle that authority well?
The President. Well, as I said before, if you look at how the FDIC has handled a situation like Indy bank, for example, it actually does these kinds of resolutions effectively when it's got the tools to do it. We don't have the tools right now.
Okay, Chuck Todd [NBC News].
National Economy/Economic Stabilization
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Some have compared this financial crisis to a war, and in times of war past Presidents have called for some form of sacrifice. Some of your programs, whether for Main Street or Wall Street, have actually cushioned the blow for those that were irresponsible during this economic period of prosperity, or supposed prosperity, that you were talking about. Why, given this new era of responsibility that you're asking for, why haven't you asked for something specific that the public should be sacrificing to participate in this economic recovery?
The President. Well, let me take that question in a couple of phases. First of all, it's not true that we have not asked sacrifice from people who are getting taxpayer money. We have imposed some very stiff conditions. The only problem that we've had so far are contracts that were put in place before we took over. But moving forward, anybody--any bank, for example, that is receiving capital from the taxpayers is going to have to have some very strict conditions in terms of how it pays out its executives, how it pays out dividends, how it's reporting its lending practices. So we want to make sure that there are some stiff conditions in place.
With respect to the American people, I think folks are sacrificing left and right. They--you've got a lot of parents who are cutting back on everything to make sure that their kids can still go to college. You've got workers who are deciding to cut an entire day--an entire day's worth of pay so that their fellow coworkers aren't laid off. I think that across the board people are making adjustments, large and small, to accommodate the fact that we're in very difficult times right now.
What I've said here in Washington is that we've got to make some tough choices; we got to make some tough budgetary choices. What we can't do, though, is sacrifice long-term growth, investments that are critical to the future. And that's why my budget focuses on health care, energy, education, the kinds of things that can build a foundation for long-term economic growth, as opposed to the fleeting prosperity that we've seen over the last several years.
I mean, when you have an economy in which the majority of growth is coming from the financial sector, when AIG selling a derivative is counted as an increase in the Gross Domestic Product, then that's not a model for sustainable economic growth. And what we have to do is invest in those things that will allow the American people's capacity for ingenuity and innovation, their ability to take risks but make sure that those risks are grounded in good products and good services that they believe they can market to the rest of the country, that those models of economic growth are what we're promoting. And that's what I think our budget does.
Economic Stabilization/Transparency in Government Spending
Q. But you don't think there should be a specific call to action? I mean, this is--you've described this as a economic crisis like nothing we have seen since the Great Depression.
The President. Well, as I said, the American people are making a host of sacrifices in their individual lives. We are going through an extraordinary crisis, but we believe that taken--if you take the steps that we've already taken with respect to housing, with respect to small businesses, if you look at what we're doing in terms of increasing liquidity in the financial system, that the steps that we're taking can actually stabilize the economy and get it moving again.
What I'm looking from the American people to do is that they are going to be doing what they've always done, which is working hard, looking after their families, making sure that despite the economic hard times, that they're still contributing to their community, that they're still participating in volunteer activities, that they are paying attention to the debates that are going on in Washington. And the budgets that we're putting forward and some of the decisions that we're having to make are going to be tough decisions, and we're going to need the support of the American people. And that's part of why what I've tried to do is to be out front as much as possible explaining in very clear terms exactly what we're doing.

Federal Budget
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Right now on Capitol Hill Senate Democrats are writing a budget and, according to press accounts and their own statements, they're not including the middle class tax cut that you include in the stimulus; they're talking about phasing that out. They're not including the cap and trade that you have in your budget, and they're not including other measures. I know when you outlined your four priorities over the weekend, a number of these things were not in there. Will you sign a budget if it does not contain a middle class tax cut, does not contain cap and trade?
The President. Well, I've emphasized repeatedly what I expect out of this budget. I expect that there's serious efforts at health care reform and that we are driving down costs for families and businesses and, ultimately, for the Federal and State governments that are going to be broke if we continue on the current path. I've said that we've got to have a serious energy policy that frees ourselves from dependence on foreign oil and makes clean energy the profitable kind of energy. We've got to invest in education, K-12 and beyond, to upgrade the skills of the American worker so we can compete in the international economy. And I've said that we've got to start driving our deficit numbers down.
Now, we never expected when we printed out our budget that they would simply Xerox it and vote on it. We assume that it has to go through the legislative process. I have not yet seen the final product coming out of the Senate or the House, and we're in constant conversations with them. I am confident that the budget we put forward will have those principles in place.
When it comes to the middle class tax cut, we already had that in the recovery. We know that that's going to be in place for at least the next 2 years. We had identified a specific way to pay for it. If Congress has better ideas in terms of how to pay for it, then we're happy to listen.
When it comes to cap and trade, the broader principle is that we've got to move to a new energy era, and that means moving away from polluting energy sources towards cleaner energy sources. That is a potential engine for economic growth. I think cap and trade is the best way, from my perspective, to achieve some of those gains, because what it does is it starts pricing the pollution that's being sent into the atmosphere.
The way it's structured has to take into account regional differences; it has to protect consumers from huge spikes in electricity prices. So there are a lot of technical issues that are going to have to be sorted through. Our point in the budget is, let's get started now; we can't wait. And my expectation is that the energy committees or other relevant committees in both the House and the Senate are going to be moving forward a strong energy package. It'll be authorized, we'll get it done, and I will sign it.
Q. So is that a ""yes,"" sir? You're willing to sign a budget that doesn't have those two provisions?
The President. No, I--what I said was I haven't seen yet what provisions are in there. The bottom line is, is that I want to see health care, energy, education, and serious efforts to reduce our deficit--our budget deficit. And there are going to be a lot of details that are still being worked out, but I have confidence that we're going to be able to get a budget done that's reflective of what needs to happen in order to make sure that America grows.
Chip Reid [CBS News].
Federal Deficit/Balancing the Federal Budget
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. At both of your town hall meetings in California last week, you said, quote, ""I didn't run for President to pass on our problems to the next generation."" But under your budget the debt will increase $7 trillion over the next 10 years; the Congressional Budget Office says $9.3 trillion. And today on Capitol Hill some Republicans called your budget, with all the spending on health care, education, and environment, the most irresponsible budget in American history. Isn't that kind of debt exactly what you were talking about when you said ""passing on our problems to the next generation""?
The President. First of all, I suspect that some of those Republican critics have a short memory, because as I recall I'm inheriting a $1.3 trillion deficit, annual deficit, from them. That would be point number one.
Point number two, both under our estimates and under the CBO estimates, both conservative--the most conservative estimates out there, we drive down the deficit over the first 5 years of our budget. The deficit is cut in half. And folks aren't disputing that.
Where the dispute comes in is what happens in a whole bunch of out-years. And the main difference between the budget that we presented and the budget that came out of Congressional Budget Office is assumptions about growth. They're assuming a growth rate of 2.2. We're assuming a growth rate of 2.6. Those small differences end up adding up to a lot of money. Our assumptions are perfectly consistent with what blue-chip forecasters out there are saying.
Now, none of us know exactly what's going to happen 6 or 8 or 10 years from now. Here's what I do know: If we don't tackle energy, if we don't improve our education system, if we don't drive down the costs of health care, if we're not making serious investments in science and technology and our infrastructure, then we won't grow 2.6 percent, we won't grow 2.2 percent. We won't grow.
And so what we've said is let's make the investments that ensure that we meet our growth targets, that put us on a pathway to growth, as opposed to a situation in which we're not making those investments and we still have trillion-dollar deficits.
And there's an interesting reason why some of these critics haven't put out their own budget. I mean, we haven't seen an alternative budget out of them. And the reason is because they know that in fact the biggest driver of long-term deficits are the huge health care costs that we've got out here that we're going to have to tackle. And we--that if we don't deal with some of the structural problems in our deficit, ones that were here long before I got here, then we're going to continue to see some of the problems in those out-years.
And so, what we're trying to emphasize is, let's make sure that we're making the investments that we need to grow, to meet those growth targets. At the same time, we're still reducing the deficit by a couple of trillion dollars; we are cutting out wasteful spending in areas like Medicare; we're changing procurement practices when it comes to the Pentagon budget; we are looking at social service programs and education programs that don't work and eliminate them. And we will continue to go line by line through this budget, and where we find programs that don't work we will eliminate them.
But it is going to be a impossible task for us to balance our budget if we're not taking on rising health care costs. And it's going to be an impossible task to balance our budget or even approximate it, if we are not boosting our growth rates. And that's why our budget focuses on the investments we need to make that happen.
Federal Budget
Q. But even under your budget, as you said, over the next 4 or 5 years, you're going to cut the deficit in half. Then after that, 6 years in a row, it goes up, up, up. If you're making all these long-term structural cuts, why does it continue to go up in the out-years?
The President. Well, look, it is going to take a whole host of adjustments, and we couldn't reflect all of those adjustments in this budget. Let me give you an example. There's been a lot of talk about entitlements and Medicare and Medicaid. The biggest problem we have long term is Medicare and Medicaid, but whatever reforms we initiative on that front--and we're very serious about working on a bipartisan basis to reduce those deficits or reduce those costs--you're not going to see those savings reflected until much later.
And so a budget is a snapshot of what we can get done right now, understanding that 8, 10 years from now we will have had a whole series of new budgets, and we're going to have to make additional adjustments. And once we get out of this current economic crisis, then it's going to be absolutely important for us to take another look and say, ""Are we growing as fast as we need to grow? Are there further cuts that we need to make? What other adjustments are--is it going to take for us to have a sustainable budget level?""
But keep in mind, just to give one other example, as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product, we are reducing nondefense discretionary spending to its lowest level since the sixties, lower than it was under Reagan, lower than it was under Clinton, lower than it was under Bush--or both Bushes. And so if we're growing, if we are doing what's necessary to create new businesses and to expand the economy, and we are making sure that we're eliminating some of these programs that aren't working, then over time that gap can close.
But I'm--look, I'm not going to lie to you, it is tough. As I said, that's why the critics tend to criticize, but they don't offer an alternative budget. Because even if we were not doing health care, we were not doing energy, we were not doing education, they'd still have a whole bunch of problems in those out-years, according to CBO projections. The only difference is that we will not have invested in what's necessary to make this economy grow.
Is Lourdes [Lourdes Meluza] here, from Univision?
Mexico-U.S. Border Security
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Today your administration presented a plan to help curb the violence in Mexico and also to control any, or prevent any, spillover of the violence into the United States. Do you consider the situation now a national security threat? And do you believe that it could require sending national troops to the border? Governor Perry of Texas has said that you still need more troops and more agents. How do you respond to that?
The President. Well, first of all, let's focus on what we did today. It's very significant. We are sending millions of dollars in additional equipment to provide more effective surveillance. We are providing hundreds of additional personnel that can help control the border, deal with customs issues. We are coordinating very effectively with the Mexican Government and President Calderon, who has taken on a extraordinarily difficult task of dealing with these drug cartels that have gotten completely out of hand.
And so the steps that we've taken are designed to make sure that the border communities in the United States are protected and you're not seeing a spillover of violence, and that we are helping the Mexican Government deal with a very challenging situation. Now, we are going to continue to monitor the situation. And if what--the steps we've taken do not get the job done, then we will do more.
One last point that I want to make about this. As I said, President Calderon has been very courageous in taking on these drug cartels. We've got to also take some steps. Even as he is doing more to deal with the drug cartels sending drugs into the United States, we need to do more to make sure that illegal guns and cash aren't flowing back to these cartels. That's part of what's financing their operations, that's part of what's arming them, that's what makes them so dangerous. And this is something that we take very seriously and we're going to continue to work on diligently in the months to come.

Veterans Administration/Defense Procurement Reform
Q. Mr. President, where do you plan to find savings in the Defense and Veterans Administrations budgets when so many items that seem destined for the chopping block are politically untenable perhaps?
The President. I'm sorry, so many?
Q. When so many items that may be destined for the chopping block seem politically untenable, from major weapons systems, as you mentioned, procurement, to wounded warrior care costs, or increased operations in Afghanistan, or the size of the military itself.
The President. Well, a couple of points I want to make. The budget that we've put forward reflects the largest increase in veterans funding in 30 years. That's the right thing to do.
Chuck asked earlier about sacrifices. I don't think anybody doubts the extraordinary sacrifices that men and women in uniform have already made. And when they come home, then they have earned the benefits that they receive, and, unfortunately, over the last several years, all too often the VA has been underresourced when it comes to dealing with things like Posttraumatic Stress Disorder or traumatic brain injury, dealing with some of the backlogs in admission to VA hospitals. So there are a whole host of veterans issues that I think every American wants to see properly funded, and that's what's reflected in our budget.
Where the savings should come in--and I've been working with Secretary Gates on this and will be detailing it more in the weeks to come--is how do we reform our procurement system so that it keeps America safe and we're not wasting taxpayer dollars. And there is uniform acknowledgement that the procurement system right now doesn't work. That's not just my opinion, that's John McCain's opinion; that's Carl Levin's opinion. There are a whole host of people who are students of the procurement process that will say, if you've got a whole range of billion-dollar--multibillion-dollar systems that are--where we're seeing cost overruns at 30 percent or 40 percent or 50 percent, and then still don't perform the way they're supposed to or aren't providing our troops with the kinds of tools that they need to succeed on their missions, then we've got a problem.
Now, I think everybody in this town knows that the politics of changing procurement is tough because lobbyists are very active in this area; contractors are very good at dispersing the jobs and plants in the Defense Department widely. And so what we have to do is to go through this process very carefully, be more disciplined than we've been in the last several years. As I've said, we've already identified potentially $40 billion in savings just by some of the procurement reforms that are pretty apparent to a lot of critics out there. And we are going to continue to find savings in a way that allows us to put the resources where they're needed, but to make sure that we're not simply fattening defense contractors.
One last point: In order for us to get a handle on these costs, it's also important that we are honest in what these costs are. And that's why it was so important for us to acknowledge the true costs of the Iraq war and the Afghan war, because if those costs are somehow off the books and we're not thinking about them, then it's hard for us to make some of the tough choices that need to be made.

Federal Deficit/Federal Budget
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You spoke again at the top about your anger about AIG. You've been saying that for days now. But why is it that it seems Andrew Cuomo seems to be in New York getting more actual action on it? And when you and Secretary Geithner first learned about this 10 days, 2 weeks ago, you didn't go public immediately with that that outrage; you waited a few days, and then you went public after you realized Secretary Geithner really had no legal avenue to stop it.
And more broadly--I just want to follow up on Chip and Jake--you've been very critical of President Bush doubling the national debt. And to be fair, it's not just Republicans hitting you; Democrat Kent Conrad, as you know, said, ""When I look at this budget, I see the debt doubling again."" You keep saying that you've inherited a big fiscal mess. Do you worry, though, that your daughters--not to mention the next President--will be inheriting an even bigger fiscal mess if the spending goes out of control?
The President. Of course I do, Ed, which is why we're doing everything we can to reduce that deficit. Look, if this were easy, then we would have already had it done, and the budget would have been voted on, and everybody could go home. This is hard. And the reason it's hard is because we've accumulated a structural deficit that's going to take a long time, and we're not going to be able to do it next year or the year after or 3 years from now. Wha","t we have to do is bend the curve on these deficit projections. And the best way for us to do that is to reduce health care costs. That's not just my opinion, that's the opinion of almost every single person who has looked at our long-term fiscal situation.
Now, how do we--how are we going to reduce health care costs, because the problem is not just in Government-run programs, the problem is in the private sector as well. It's experienced by families; it's experienced by businesses. And so what we've said is, look, let's invest in health information technologies; let's invest in preventive care; let's invest in mechanisms that look at who's doing a better job controlling costs while producing good quality outcomes in various States, and let's reimburse on the basis of improved quality, as opposed to simply how many procedures you're doing. Let's do a whole host of things, some of which cost money on the front end but offer the prospect of reducing costs on the back end.
Now, the alternative is to stand pat and to simply say, we are just going to not invest in health care; we're not going to take on energy; we'll wait until the next time that gas gets to $4 a gallon; we will not improve our schools, and we'll allow China or India or other countries to lap our young people in terms of their performance; we will settle on lower growth rates, and we will continue to contract, both as an economy and our ability to provide a better life for our kids.
That I don't think is the better option. Now, have--am I completely satisfied with all the work that needs to be done on deficits? No. That's why I convened a fiscal responsibility summit, started in this room, to start looking at entitlements and to start looking at the big drivers of costs over the long term. Not all of those are reflected in our budget, partly because the savings we anticipate would be coming in years outside of the 10-year budget cycle that we're talking about. Okay?
Bonuses for American International Group (AIG) Executives
Q. On AIG, why did you wait days to come out and express that outrage? It seems like the action is coming out of New York and the attorney general's office. It took you days to come public with Secretary Geithner and say, look, we're outraged. Why did it take so long?
The President. It took us a couple of days because I like to know what I'm talking about before I speak, you know? [Laughter]

Global Economy/Strength of the Dollar/U.S. Image Abroad
Q. Good evening, Mr. President. Thank you. Taking this economic debate a bit globally, senior Chinese officials have publically expressed an interest in international currency. This is described by Chinese specialists as a sign that they are less confident than they used to be in the value and the reliability of the U.S. dollar. European countries have resisted your calls to spend more on economic stimulus. I wonder, sir, as a candidate who ran concerned about the image of the United States globally, how comfortable you are with the Chinese Government, run by Communists, less confident than they used to be in the U.S. dollar, and European governments, some of them center-left, some of them socialist, who say you're asking them to spend too much.
The President. Well, first of all, I haven't asked them to do anything. What I've suggested is, is that all of us are going to have to take steps in order to lift the economy. We don't want a situation in which some countries are making extraordinary efforts, and other countries aren't, with the hope that somehow the countries that are making those important steps lift everybody up. And so somebody has got to take leadership.
It's not just me, by the way. I was with Kevin Rudd, the Prime Minister of Australia, today, who was very forceful in suggesting that countries around the world, those with the capacity to do so, take the steps that are needed to fill this enormous hole in global demand. Gordon Brown, when he came to visit me, said the exact same thing.
So the goal at the G-20 summit, I think, is to do a couple of things: Number one, say to all countries, let's do what's necessary in order to create jobs and to get the economy moving again. Let's avoid steps that could result in protectionism, that would further contract global trade. Let's focus on how are we going to move our regulatory process forward in order that we do not see the kinds of systemic breakdowns that we've already seen. And that requires--that means not just dealing with banks, but also some of the other financial flows that are out here that are currently unregulated. We've got to update regulations that date back to the 1930s, and we're going to have to do some coordination with other countries in order to accomplish that.
As far as confidence in the U.S. economy or the dollar, I would just point out that the dollar is extraordinarily strong right now. And the reason the dollar is strong right now is because investors consider the United States the strongest economy in the world, with the most stable political system in the world. So you don't have to take my word for it. I think that there is a great deal of confidence that, ultimately, although we are going through a rough patch, that the prospects for the world economy are very, very strong.
And last point I would make in terms of changing America's image in the world, Garrett, I've--you know, I haven't looked at the latest polling around the world, but I think it's fair to say that the response that people have had to our administration and the steps that we've taken are ones that are restoring a sense of confidence and the ability of the United States to assert global leadership. That will just strengthen.
Need for Global Currency
Q. And the need for a global----
The President. Excuse me?
Q. ----the need for a global currency?
The President. I don't believe that there's a need for a global currency.
Mike Allen, Politico. Hi, Mike.
Tax Code Reforms
Q. Mr. President, are you reconsidering--thank you, Mr. President. Are you reconsidering your plan to cut the interest rate deduction for mortgages and for charities? And do you regret having proposed that in the first place?
The President. No, I think it's the right thing to do, where we've got to make some difficult choices. Here's what we did with respect to tax policy. What we said was that over the last decade, the average worker, the average family have seen their wages and incomes flat. Even at times where supposedly we were in the middle of an economic boom, as a practical matter, their incomes didn't go up. And so what we said, let's give them a tax cut, let's give them some relief, some help, 95 percent of American families.
Now, for the top 5 percent, they're the ones who typically saw huge gains in their income. I fall in that category. And what we've said is for those folks, let's not renew the Bush tax cuts, so let's go back to the rates that existed back in--during the Clinton era when wealthy people were still wealthy and doing just fine; and let's look at the level in which people can itemize their deductions. And what we've said is let's go back to the rate that existed under Ronald Reagan.
People are still going to be able to make charitable contributions. It just means, if you give $100 and you're in this tax bracket, at a certain point, instead of being able write off 36 or 39 percent, you're writing off 28 percent. Now, if it's really a charitable contribution, I'm assuming that that shouldn't be a determining factor as to whether you're given that $100 to the homeless shelter down the street.
And so this provision would affect about 1 percent of the American people. They would still get deductions. It's just that they wouldn't be able to write off 39 percent. In that sense, what it would do is it would equalize--when I give $100, I'd get the same amount of deduction as when some--a bus driver, who's making $50,000 a year or $40,000 a year, gives that same $100. Right now he gets 28 percent--he gets to write off 28 percent; I get to write off 39 percent. I don't think that's fair.
So I think this was a good idea. I think it is a realistic way for us to raise some revenue from people who benefited enormously over the last several years. It's not going to cripple them; they'll still be well-to-do. And ultimately, if we're going to tackle the serious problems that we've got, then in some cases those who are more fortunate are going to have to pay a little bit more.
Charitable Giving
Q. But it's not the well-to-do people, it's the charities. Given what you just said, are you confident the charities are wrong when they contend that this would discourage giving?
The President. Yes, I am. I mean, if you look at the evidence, there's very little evidence that this has a significant impact on charitable giving. I'll tell you what has a significant impact on charitable giving, is a financial crisis in an economy that's contracting. And so the most important thing that I can do for charitable giving is to fix the economy, to get banks lending again, to get businesses opening their doors again, and to get people back to work again. Then I think charities will do just fine.
Kevin Chappell [Ebony]. Hi, Kevin.
Homelessness in America
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. A recent report found that as a result of the economic downturn, 1 in 50 children are now homeless in America. With shelters at full capacity, tent cities are sprouting up across the country. In passing your stimulus package, you said that help was on the way. But what would you say to these families, especially children, who are sleeping under bridges in tents across the country?
The President. Well, the first thing I'd say is that I'm heartbroken that any child in America is homeless. And the most important thing that I can do on their behalf is to make sure their parents have a job.
And that's why the recovery package said as a first priority, how are we going to save or create 3.5 million jobs? How can we prevent layoffs for teachers and police officers? How can we make sure that we are investing in the infrastructure for the future that can put people back to work right away? How do we make sure that when people do lose their jobs that their unemployment insurance is extended, that they can keep their health care? So there are a whole host of steps that we've done to provide a cushion for folks who have fallen on very hard times and to try to spur immediate projects that can put people back to work.
Now, in the meantime, we've got to work very closely with the States to monitor and to help people who are still falling through the cracks. And the homeless problem was bad even when the economy was good. Part of the change in attitudes that I want to see here in Washington and all across the country is a belief that it is not acceptable for children and families to be without a roof over their heads in a country as wealthy as ours. And so we're going to be initiating a range of programs, as well, to deal with homelessness.
One area in particular I want to focus on is the issue of veterans. The rate of homelessness among veterans is much, much higher than for nonveteran populations. And so we've got--a number of the increases that we're looking for in our budget on veterans funding directly addresses the issue of homeless veterans. That, I think, can provide some real help.
Ann Compton [ABC Radio]. Hey, Ann.
Race in America
Q. Sir--hey. [Laughter]
The President. You sound surprised. [Laughter]
Q. I am surprised. Could I ask you about race?
The President. You may.
Q. Yours is a rather historic Presidency. And I'm just wondering whether in any of the policy debates that you've had within the White House the issue of race has come up, or whether it has in the way you feel you've been perceived by other leaders or by the American people. Or has the last 64 days been a relatively colorblind time?
The President. I think that the last 64 days has been dominated by me trying to figure out how we're going to fix the economy. And that's--affects black, brown, and white. And, you know, obviously, at the Inauguration I think that there was justifiable pride on the part of the country that we had taken a step to move us beyond some of the searing legacies of racial discrimination in this country. But that lasted about a day--[laughter]--and, you know, right now the American people are judging me exactly the way I should be judged, and that is, are we taking the steps to improve liquidity in the financial markets, create jobs, get businesses to reopen, keep America safe. And that's what I've been spending my time thinking about.

Federal Funds for Stem Cell Research
Q. Right here, sir.
The President. There you go.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Sure.
Q. In your remarks on stem cell research earlier this month, you talked about a majority consensus in determining whether or not this is the right thing to do, to federally fund embryonic stem cell research. I'm just wondering, though, how much you, personally, wrestled with the morality or ethics of federally funding this kind of research, especially given the fact that science so far has shown a lot of progress with adult stem cells, but not a lot with embryonic.
The President. Okay. I think it's a legitimate question. I wrestle with these issues every day, as I mentioned to--I think in an interview a couple of days ago. By the time an issue reaches my desk, it's a hard issue. If it was an easy issue, somebody else would have solved it, and it wouldn't have reached me.
Look, I believe that it is very important for us to have strong moral guidelines, ethical guidelines, when it comes to stem cell research or anything that touches on, you know, the issues of possible cloning or issues related to, you know, the human life sciences. I think those issues are all critical, and I've said so before. I wrestle with it on stem cell; I wrestle with it on issues like abortion.
I think that the guidelines that we provided meet that ethical test. What we have said is that for embryos that are typically about to be discarded, for us to be able to use those in order to find cures for Parkinson's or for Alzheimer's or, you know, all sorts of other debilitating diseases--juvenile diabetes--that it is the right thing to do. And that's not just my opinion, that is the opinion of a number of people who are also against abortion.
Now, I am glad to see progress is being made in adult stem cells. And if the science determines that we can completely avoid a set of ethical questions or political disputes, then that's great. I have no investment in causing controversy. I'm happy to avoid it, if that's where the science leads us. But what I don't want to do is predetermine this based on a very rigid, scientific--ideological approach, and that's what I think is reflected in the Executive order that I signed.
Ethics in Scientific Research
Q. I meant to ask a followup, though. Do you think that scientific consensus is enough to tell us what we can and cannot do?
The President. No. I think there's always an ethical and a moral element that has to be a part of this. And so, as I said, I don't take decisions like this lightly. They're ones that I take seriously. And I respect people who have different opinions on this issue. But I think that this was the right thing to do and the ethical thing to do. And as I said before, my hope is, is that we can find a mechanism, ultimately, to cure these diseases in a way that gains 100 percent consensus. And we certainly haven't achieved that yet, but I think on balance this was the right step to take.

Middle East Peace Process/Domestic Agenda/Iran
Q. Mr. President, you came into office pledging to work for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. How realistic do you think those hopes are now, given the likelihood of a Prime Minister who's not fully signed up to a two-state solution and a Foreign Minister who has been accused of insulting Arabs?
The President. It's not easier than it was, but I think it's just as necessary. We don't yet know what the Israeli Government is going to look like, and we don't yet know what the future shape of Palestinian leadership is going to be comprised of. What we do know is this: That the status quo is unsustainable; that it is critical for us to advance a two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side in their own states with peace and security.
And by assigning George Mitchell the task of working as Special Envoy, what we've signaled is that we're going to be serious from day one in trying to move the parties in a direction that acknowledges that reality. How effective these negotiations may be, I think we're going to have to wait and see. But, you know, we were here for St. Patrick's Day, and you'll recall that we had what had been previously sworn enemies celebrating here in this very room, you know, leaders from the two sides in Northern Ireland that, you know, a couple of decades ago or even a decade ago, people would have said could never achieve peace. And here they were, jointly appearing and talking about their commitment even in the face of violent provocation. And what that tells me is that if you stick to it, if you are persistent, then these problems can be dealt with.
That whole philosophy of persistence, by the way, is one that I'm going to be emphasizing again and again in the months and years to come, as long as I'm in this office. I'm a big believer in persistence. I think that when it comes to domestic affairs, if we keep on working at it, if we acknowledge that we make mistakes sometimes and that we don't always have the right answer and we're inheriting very knotty problems, that we can pass health care, we can find better solutions to our energy challenges, we can teach our children more effectively, we can deal with a very real budget crisis that is not fully dealt with in my budget at this point but makes progress.
I think when it comes to the banking system, you know, it was just a few days ago or weeks ago where people were certain that Secretary Geithner couldn't deliver a plan. Today the headlines all look like, well, all right, there's a plan. And I'm sure there will be more criticism, and we'll have to make more adjustments, but we're moving in the right direction.
When it comes to Iran, you know, we did a video sending a message to the Iranian people and the leadership of the Islamic Republic of Iran. And some people said, ""Well, they did not immediately say that we're eliminating nuclear weapons and stop funding terrorism."" Well, we didn't expect that. We expect that we're going to make steady progress on this front. We haven't immediately eliminated the influence of lobbyists in Washington. We have not immediately eliminated wasteful pork projects. And we're not immediately going to get Middle East peace. We've been in office now a little over 60 days.
What I am confident about is that we're moving in the right direction and that the decisions we're making are based on how are we going to get this economy moving, how are we going to put Americans back to work, how are we going to make sure that our people are safe, and how are we going to create not just prosperity here but work with other countries for global peace and prosperity. And we are going to stay with it as long as I'm in this office, and I think that you look back 4 years from now, I think, hopefully, people will judge that body of work and say, this is a big ocean liner--it's not a speedboat, it doesn't turn around immediately--but we're in a better place because of the decisions that we make.
All right. Thank you, everybody."
"April 16, 2009",The President's News Conference With President Felipe de Jesus Calderon Hinojosa of Mexico in Mexico City,Barack Obama,"Barack Obama, The President's News Conference With President Felipe de Jesus Calderon Hinojosa of Mexico in Mexico City Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/286601",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-felipe-de-jesus-calderon-hinojosa-mexico-1,"President Calderon. Ladies and gentlemen of the press, of the media, I would like to give the warmest welcome to Mexico, to President Barack Obama, and to the delegation accompanying him. This is an historic event that will inaugurate a new era, a new relationship between our two countries.
Today in the meetings that we have held, we have confirmed the determination of both Governments to consolidate the very, very close contacts and links that join and bring together Mexico and the United States. We have new projects in important affairs, such as security, migration, competitiveness, and global affairs. As never before, we have decided that the fight against multinational organized crime must be based on cooperation, shared responsibility, and in trust, a mutual trust.
Both Governments recognize that the Merida Initiative is a very good starting point in order to strengthen cooperation in security. But we want to go beyond; we want to go further in order to liberate, to free our societies from the criminal activities that affect the lives of millions of people.
We have also agreed to expedite the times so that we can have available the resources for this Merida Initiative. And we have also decided to launch other activities that are in the hands of our Governments. For example, we can adopt new measures for preventing illicit flows at the border, particularly the flow of weapons and of cash. We will also be strengthening our cooperation in information and intelligence in order to more efficiently fight against money laundering.
On the other hand, we have also agreed that both Governments should produce a--propositions--proposals for our cooperation so that we can eventually have reform in the United States with full respect to the sovereign decisions of both Congresses--of both nations, that is. Our Governments will work in this sense to make migration an orderly, respectful process of human rights, a process in which human rights will be respected.
In energy and climate change, we have agreed to work together in order to guarantee a legal framework of certainty, transparency for the future, better use of cross-border resources such as gas and energy. And I have given to President Obama concrete proposals on climate change. One of them has to do with the integration of a bilateral market of carbon emissions, which coincides a lot with proposals that he has made to the U.S. audience, and other cooperation--ways of cooperation in climate change, such as something that Mexico has proposed called the Green Fund.
We have also said that in addition to discussing our goals for carbon emissions that are linked in the fight against climate change globally, we must also act very soon in the design of new instruments, of new tools in order to fight against climate change. That is really the central proposal of the Green Fund.
And in a gesture of recognition, of acknowledgment on this topic, we know that President Obama and his Government have made considerable efforts to provide new arguments to the discussion of this topic. We would also like to thank--to welcome the possibility that Mexico might be the seat of the 16th U.N. conference on climate change that will be taking place in 2010.
We have recognized and acknowledged, ladies and gentlemen, that Mexico and the United States do not have to compete among themselves, but rather they must be able to take advantage of the complementary nature of their economies in order to compete as partners with regard to other parts of the world. We have the chance to make our region more competitive and to have greater, more agile production.
And we will be working in three areas. First, in the strengthening of the border infrastructure, I have also given to President Obama a proposal to facilitate the economic flows between both countries to improve the quality of life of the residents in the border areas and to foster the development of our two nations through very specific projects with--on infrastructure at the Mexican-U.S. border. Secondly, we believe it is essential to increase our cooperation and customs so that we can have a more efficient trade. And thirdly, we have also proposed to improve our cooperation in regulatory matters regarding tariffs or nontariffs issues that very often make difficult our trade between two countries.
We have agreed with President Obama that we seek agreements to truly improve the economic situation not only of the United States, but of the entire region and the world. We have stated our cooperation to strengthen the democracy of the market and of regional security.
In relation to President Obama's recent security to lift the restrictions for people from the U.S. to travel to Cuba and to be able to send remittances, Mexico acknowledges that this is a very constructive, positive step for the hemispheric relations, particularly for the region.
And finally, my friends, ladies and gentlemen, I want to tell you that I am absolutely convinced that President Obama's visit is just an initial step, the beginning of a relationship between two countries that are friends, neighbors, and must also be partners and allies.
Thank you so much. Thank you so much, President Obama, for your visit.
President Obama. I want to begin by thanking the people of Mexico for their gracious welcome. And I want to thank President Calderon for the hospitality he has shown us as host.
You know, this is my first trip to Mexico as President, and I see this visit, as I know President Calderon does, as an opportunity to launch a new era of cooperation and partnership between our two countries, an era built on an even firmer foundation of mutual responsibility and mutual respect and mutual interest. We had a productive and wide-ranging conversation, and I think we have taken some very important steps down that path.
It's difficult to overstate the depth of the ties between our two nations or the extraordinary importance of our relationship. It's obviously a simple fact of geography that we share a border, and we've always been bound together because of that geography. But it's not just that shared border that links us together. It's not only geography, but it's also culture, it's also the migration patterns that have taken place that have become so important.
Our deep economic ties mean that whenever--whatever steps that we're going to take moving forward have to be taken together. And that's why we worked hard, hand in hand, at the G-20 summit. And that's what we will continue to do at the Summit of the Americas and beyond so that we can jump-start job creation, promote free and fair trade, and develop a coordinated response to this economic crisis.
We also discussed our shared interest in meeting an immigration challenge that has serious implications for both the United States and for Mexico. My country has been greatly enriched by migration from Mexico. Mexican Americans form a critical and enduring link between our nations. And I am committed to fixing our broken immigration system in a way that upholds our traditions as a nation of laws, but also as a nation of immigrants. And I'm committed to working with President Calderon to promote the kind of bottom-up economic growth here in Mexico that will allow people to live out their dreams here and, as a consequence, will relieve some of the pressures that we've seen along the borders.
We also discussed what our nations can do to help bring a clean energy future to both countries. This is a priority for the United States. I know it's a priority for President Calderon. And I want to commend him for the work that he's already made in cutting greenhouse gas emissions, the commitment that he's made even though Mexico is not required to do so under the Kyoto Protocol. And together, we're establishing a new bilateral framework on clean energy and climate change that will focus on creating green jobs, promoting renewable energy, and enhancing energy efficiency. I look forward to strengthening our partnership in the upcoming Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate and in next year's U.N. climate negotiations, which I hope will be held here in Mexico.
Now, as essential as it is that we work together to overcome each of these common challenges, there's one particular area that requires our urgent and coordinated action, and that is the battle that's taking place with respect to the drug cartels that are fueling kidnapings and sowing chaos in our communities and robbing so many of a future, both here in Mexico and in the United States.
I have said this before; I will repeat it: I have the greatest admiration and courage for President Calderon and his entire cabinet, his rank-and-file police officers and soldiers as they take on these cartels. I commend Mexico for the successes that have already been achieved. But I will not pretend that this is Mexico's responsibility alone. A demand for these drugs in the United States is what is helping to keep these cartels in business. This war is being waged with guns purchased not here, but in the United States. More than 90 percent of the guns recovered in Mexico come from the United States, many from gun shops that line our shared border.
So we have responsibilities as well. We have to do our part. We have to crack down on drug use in our cities and towns. We have to stem the southbound flow of guns and cash. And we are absolutely committed to working in a partnership with Mexico to make sure that we are dealing with this scourge on both sides of the border.
And that's why we're ramping up the number of law enforcement personnel on our border. That's why, for the first time, we are inspecting trains leaving our country, not just those entering it. That's why our Department of Homeland Security is making up to $59 million available to defend our common border from this threat to both of our countries.
Now, as we discussed in our meeting, destroying and disrupting the cartels will require more than aggressive efforts from each of our nations. And that's why the United States is taking the following steps: We've begun to accelerate efforts to implement the Merida Initiative so we can provide Mexico with the military aircraft and inspection equipment they need when they need it.
Yesterday I designated three cartels as significant foreign narcotics drug traffickers under U.S. law, clearing the way for our Treasury Department, working together with Mexico, to freeze their assets and subject them to sanctions. My National Homeland Security Adviser, who is here, General Jim Jones, as well as my Homeland Security Secretary, Janet Napolitano, and my top adviser on homeland security and counterterrorism, John Brennan, are all meeting with their Mexican counterparts to develop new ways to cooperate and coordinate their efforts more effectively. In addition, as President Calderon and I discussed, I am urging the Senate in the United States to ratify an inter-American treaty known as CIFTA to curb small-arms trafficking that is a source of so many of the weapons used in this drug war.
Now, there are some of the common challenges that President Calderon and I discussed in our meeting and that we're going to be working on to overcome in the months and years ahead. It will not be easy, but I am confident that if we continue to act as we have today, in a spirit of mutual responsibility and friendship, we will prevail on behalf of our common security and our common prosperity. So I think that this is building on previous meetings that we've had. In each interaction, the bond between our Governments is growing stronger. I am confident that we're going to make tremendous progress in the future. Thank you.
Assault Weapons Ban/Border Security
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President, as well. President Obama, as a candidate for your office, you said that you wanted to see the assault ban weapon--the ban on assault weapons reinstated. Your Attorney General has spoken in favor of this. Mexican officials have also spoken in favor of it. But we haven't heard you say that since you took office. Do you plan to keep your promise? And if not, how do you explain that to the American people?
President Obama. Oh----
Q. And, President Calderon--I'm sorry--if I may, would you like to see this ban reinstated? And have you raised that today with President Obama? Thank you.
President Obama. Well, first of all, we did discuss this extensively in our meetings. I have not backed off at all from my belief that the gun--the assault weapons ban made sense. And I continue to believe that we can respect and honor the second amendment rights in our Constitution, the rights of sportsmen and hunters and homeowners who want to keep their families safe to lawfully bear arms, while dealing with assault weapons that, as we now know, here in Mexico, are helping to fuel extraordinary violence--violence in our own country as well.
Now, having said that, I think none of us are under any illusion that reinstating that ban would be easy. And so what we've focused on is how we can improve our enforcement of existing laws, because even under current law, trafficking illegal firearms, sending them across a border, is illegal. That's something that we can stop.
And so our focus is to work with Secretary Napolitano, Attorney General Holder, our entire Homeland Security team, ATF, border security, everybody who is involved in this, to coordinate with our counterparts in Mexico to significantly ramp up our enforcement of existing laws. And in fact, I've asked Eric Holder to do a complete review of how our enforcement operations are currently working and make sure that we're cutting down on the loopholes that are resulting in some of these drug trafficking problems.
Last point I would make is that there are going to be some opportunities where I think we can build some strong consensus. I'll give you one example, and that is the issue of gun tracing. The tracing of bullets and ballistics and gun information that have been used in major crimes, that's information that we are still not giving to law enforcement as a consequence of provisions that have been blocked in the United States Congress, and those are the areas where I think that we can make some significant progress early. That doesn't mean that we're steering away from the issue of the assault guns ban, but it does mean that we want to act with urgency, promptly, now. And I think we can make significant progress.
President Calderon. Thank you for your question. I want to say that, in effect, on this topic--not only on this topic, but on many of the other thorny topics of relations between U.S. and Mexico, we have had an open, frank, trusting conversation between President Obama and myself. We have spoken of assault weapons. He is well aware of our problems, and we have described it as it is.
From the moment that the prohibition of--on the sale of assault weapons a few years ago, we have seen an increase in the power of organized crime in Mexico. Only in my administration, in the 2 years and 4 months, we have been able to see--or rather we have seized more than 16,000 assault weapons. And in the efforts we have made to track their origin--and President Obama has referred to that--we have seen that nearly 90 percent of those arms comes from the United States--those weapons come from the United States. There are about 10,000 sales points in the U.S.-Mexico border--only at the border.
On the other hand, I do believe that our relationship--the new era we must build in our relationship between Mexico and the United States must be one with trust and respect. And we definitely respect the decision of the U.S. Congress and of the U.S. people in this regard, because they are very well aware of President Obama and his Government's willingness to move forward on these issues.
We know that it is a politically delicate topic because Americans truly appreciate their constitutional rights, and particularly those that are part of the second amendment. I personally believe that as long as we are able to explain clearly what our problems in Mexico are, then we might also be able to seek a solution that--respecting the constitutional rights of the Americans, at the same time, will prevent--or rather avoid that organized crime becomes better armed in our country. But we have to work on it. We have to work on it. But we fully respect the opinion of the U.S. Congress, and we know that there's a great deal of sensitivity regarding this topic.
But there are many, many things that we can definitely move forward in. For example, in armament, it is not only a matter of seeing whether we can change the legislation on assault weapons--we have already said what our position is--but we might also be able to see whether they can apply existing legislation in Mexico and the United States on armament. For example, in Mexico it's a matter of enforcement with the Export Control Act. For example, the Export Control Act--this is in the United States; I'm sorry--prohibits the export of weapons to those countries where those weapons are prohibited. And that is the case of Mexico. If we actually comply with the U.S. law--or rather if everybody complies with the U.S. law that prohibits the sale of these weapons and their export to Mexico, we can move a great deal forward.
President Obama has made recent decisions in the last few weeks, and we value them and appreciate them, for example, to reinforce the operational capability of U.S. border agencies in order to comply with this legislation and with other laws, in order to review the flows of entry not only into the United States, but also the outgoing flows, outgoing from the U.S., to make sure that there is no illicit money, in strict compliance with United States legislation. I think these are very important steps.
But there is a problem, and only as long as we build on this trust and we clearly explain to citizens of both countries how we must find a solution, we will be able to achieve one. We do so respectfully, presenting our position, knowing full well how the U.S. people feel about this and being fully respectful of the sovereign decisions that the United States might make or that any other country might make.
One more thing I forgot to mention: One other thing we can do is to track the weapons that we have in Mexico. If we manage to detect weapons sold illegally in the United States in violation of this law on the control of weapons exports, or if, in the United States, they can have--probably move forward on a good registry of armament or on the prohibition of certain massive sales of weapons, for example, to a hunter or to a common citizen--we know that these people do not usually buy hundreds of rifles or assault weapons or of grenades--if we can move forward in those areas, I do believe that security both of Mexico--both of the United States and Mexico will improve, because those weapons are pointing against Mexican people and Mexican officials today.
But crime is not only acting in Mexico; it is also acting in the United States. Organized crime is acting in both countries. And I do hope that those weapons that are sold today in the United States and are being used in Mexico, I hope the day will never come in which they will also be used against the North American society or against U.S. officials, just like they are now being used in Mexico.
Mexico-U.S. Relations and Drug Control Cooperation
Q. Good afternoon, Presidents. You are going to share 4 years of an administration, and there can be an in-depth change in this fight against organized crime in these 4 years. As of today, how can we establish the concrete objectives that in 2012 will allow us to say, fine, a new era began between Mexico and the United States back then?
Particularly I'm addressing this to you, President Obama. In addition to the chance that you will invest your political capital in being able to stop the flow of these weapons to Mexico, what can we hope for? How--what can we expect to see in terms of arresting the drug lords, the kingpins in the U.S.? Because there are laws against corruption, but this is enabling now; in other words, the U.S. market is now the biggest for drugs. And a former President of Mexico, ex-President Fox, said that in the back they have only gotten little pats in the back from his predecessors. Can we hope for more from your administration?
And to you, President Calderon, with this new era, how can you measure the detention, the arrest of drug lords in the United States and also putting a stop to the flow of weapons? How can you measure this?
President Obama. Well, I think that we can measure this in terms of the reduction in violence, in the interdiction of drugs, in the interdiction of weapons coming south, in the dismantling of the financial structures that facilitate these drug cartels, in the arrest of major drug kingpins.
So I think we know how to measure progress. The challenge is maintaining a sustained effort. And as I said, something that President Calderon and myself absolutely recognize is that you can't fight this war with just one hand. You can't just have Mexico making an effort but the United States not making an effort. And the same is true on the other side.
I think both our efforts have to be coordinated; both of our efforts have to be strengthened. I've made some very concrete commitments, already sending additional resources, already making additional investments. These are measurable in millions and, ultimately, billions of dollars over several years. And I believe that President Calderon has used enormous political capital to deal with this issue.
Obviously, the Mexican people, particularly along the borders, have suffered great hardship. And as a consequence, if we partner effectively--and that's why I brought many of my top officials on this trip to interact with their counterparts--I'm confident that we're going to make progress. Now, are we going to eliminate all drug flows? Are we going to eliminate all guns coming over the border? That's not a realistic objective. What is a realistic objective is to reduce it so significantly, so drastically, that it becomes once again a localized criminal problem as opposed to a major structural problem that threatens stability in communities along those borders and that increases corruption and threatens the rule of law. That's the kind of progress that I think can be made.
And so we're going to work as hard as we can and as diligently as we can on these issues, always mindful, though, that the relationship between Mexico and the United States cannot just be defined by drugs. Sometimes there's a tendency for the media to only report on drug interdiction or immigration when it comes to U.S.-Mexican relations. And one of the things that we talked about is the extraordinary opportunities for us to work together on our commercial ties, on strengthening border infrastructure to improve the flow of goods, on working on clean energy, which can produce jobs on both sides of the border.
So we're going to stay very focused on this. We're going to make this a top priority, but we just always want to remember that our relationship is not simply defined by these problems; it's also defined by opportunities. And that's what we want to take advantage of as well.
President Calderon. Thank you, President. I agree a great deal with you, and I fully thank you for your support and understanding in this very difficult topic. I think the question is very relevant. I see a big opportunity for President Obama and myself, since we are going to be sharing the next 4 years as heads of our administrations; I see a big opportunity here.
And on this issue, what I hope to see at the end of my administration is, actually, many things. One is a reduction in the levels of criminal activities in our countries related to organized crime, which is also related to drug trafficking; they go hand in hand. We have a strategy with short-, mid-term, and long-term objectives.
In the short term, for example, we have set out to recuperate the security and tranquility of our citizens, particularly in those areas that have been harder hit by the crime. And this is where we have the joint operations where we are mobilizing not only our federal police but also the army; and this, regardless of the fact that it is not an easy matter and it hasn't been and it can change as--in the course of time, but at least we begin to see fruitful results in some areas.
For example, in the last quarter--or rather compared to the last quarter of last year, our first quarter of this year, there is already a drop of 27 percent in criminal activities. That is as an average for the entire country. Only in Ciudad Juarez--as of the joint operation that we launched in February--between February and March, violent deaths in Ciudad Juarez, crime-related--violence related to crime dropped by 80 percent.
Of course, I understand that the spectacular nature of some of these operations has really attracted worldwide attention. But with a very difficult crime rate that we had last year, despite them, crime in Mexico was 10.7 deaths because of crime for every 100,000 inhabitants. It is less than what it is in Guatemala, El Salvador, Colombia, Venezuela, or Brazil in Latin America, and it is also a lower number than the crime rates of many U.S. cities.
I believe one issue has to be, of course, that we have to cut down on crime in Mexico, for sure, but, number two, I hope, in the course of time, to be a safer border and a more efficient border. As long as--if we are able to stop the flow of drugs, illicit money, and weapons, we will have greater progress both in the United States and Mexico. And one way to measure this is by appreciating and valuing the technological capabilities, particularly of nonintrusive detection at the border, so that for those who do want to make business and do want to trade, that the border is open, and those who want to commit crime, the border will be a closed area. One way to measure this--and here U.S. cooperation is essential--is to have the right technology, particularly nonintrusive technology that will enable us to have safe borders. And the initiative--the Merida Initiative is very much focused on this.
Now, in the midterm, we would like a renewal of our police forces in Mexico. At the end of my administration, I would like to be able to have a new federal police that will be worthy of the citizens' trust and that will be efficient. And here U.S. cooperation is also fundamental. Why? Well, because on our side we are cleaning our house; we are sweeping everything from top to bottom so that all the police forces at the--from the top officials at the Attorney General's office, the army, the navy, that all officials in Mexico, all police officials, that we can truly trust in their honesty, and that at the same time, technologically, they will be top-notch as the rest of the world in investigation, in databases. We want a scientific police, one that is very well-trained in technology, and U.S. help will be very welcome and it will be essential.
We also have a judicial plan for oral trials. And I think that as we fulfill these objectives, many of them have already--are part of our agreement on safety, security, and protection. With a shared responsibility that we now have with President Obama and his team, we are certain that we will reach these objectives, and that our strategy, which is the correct one, will have many more possibilities of achieving success, and that at the end of our administration we will have a Mexico, a United States, that are much safer and freer of violence--violence free, rather.
Of course, drug trafficking cannot be ended by decree. As long as there is a supply, a high--or rather, is high demand, there will be a high supply. But what we can control is the effect of criminal activities in society to stop the actions of organized crime. And we can also act preventively in order to bring down the consumption of drugs in the United States and in Mexico too, which also begins to be a problem of great concern to us.
Cuba
Q. Mr. President, thank you. Mr. President.
President Obama, you said in an op-ed that was out today that your new Cuba policy was part of an effort to move beyond the frozen disputes of the 20th century. Why then is it so limited? Why not open the door for all Americans to visit Cuba? And what will you say to your colleagues at the Summit of the Americas who want you to do more?
And, President Calderon, what do you think the United States should do more and--on Cuba in order to improve relations with the region? Thank you.
President Obama. Okay. Well, first of all, I don't think that we should dismiss the significance of the step that we took. We eliminated remittance restrictions and travel restrictions for Cuban Americans who have family members in Cuba. For those families, this is extraordinarily significant. For the people in Cuba who will benefit from their family members being able to provide them help and to visit them, it's extraordinarily significant. We took steps on telecommunications that can potentially open up greater lines of communication between Cuba and the United States.
And so I think what you saw was a good-faith effort, a show of good faith on the part of the United States that we want to recast our relationship. Now, a relationship that effectively has been frozen for 50 years is not going to thaw overnight. And so having taken the first step, I think it's very much in our interest to see whether Cuba is also ready to change. We don't expect them to change overnight. That would be unrealistic. But we do expect that Cuba will send signals that they're interested in liberalizing in such a way that not only do U.S.-Cuban relations improve, but so that the energy and creativity and initiative of the Cuban people can p","otentially be released.
I mean, we talk about the ban on U.S. travel to Cuba, but there's not much discussion of the ban on Cuban people traveling elsewhere and the severe restrictions that they're under. I make that point only to suggest that there are a range of steps that could be taken on the part of the Cuban Government that would start to show that they want to move beyond the patterns of the last 50 years.
I'm optimistic that progress can be made if there is a spirit that is looking forward rather than backward. My guidepost in U.S.-Cuba policy is going to be how can we encourage Cuba to be respectful of the rights of its people: political speech, political participation, freedom of religion, freedom of the press, freedom to--of travel. But, as I said before, I don't expect things to change overnight. What I do insist on is that U.S.-Cuban relationships are grounded with a respect not only for the traditions of each country but also respect for human rights and the people's--the needs of the people of Cuba.
And so I hope that the signal I've sent here is, is that we are not trying to be heavy-handed. We want to be open to engagement, but we're going to do so in a systematic way that keeps focus on the hardships and struggles that many Cubans are still going through.
President Calderon. I would not pretend to give advice or suggestions to President Obama on this matter or any other. Let me just say what I personally believe--or rather, what I believe about the Cuban reality. The question that has to be posed, rather, is whether the U.S. embargo on Cuba has worked. The reality is that the embargo has been there long before we were even born, and yet things have not changed all that much in Cuba. I think we would have to ask ourselves whether that isn't enough time to realize that it has been a strategy that has not been very useful to achieve change in Cuba.
I do think--I share fully the idea--we do not believe that the embargo or the isolation of Cuba is a good measure for things to change in Cuba. On the contrary, the reality that we see there is that the reality has not changed. And it's because of internal factors, mostly, of course, but also because of external reasons, such as the embargo. Because of that, the Cubans have become impoverished.
I greet--I welcome the measures that President Obama has taken in order to change this attitude and to try to attempt--and the attempt must be appreciated--to change the policy towards Cuba little by little. But what is clear to me is that we both share the same ideals. I think we would both like to see the world living at some point under a full democracy, a world with full respect for human rights, with no exceptions whatsoever. We would like to see a world working, with people being able to take care of their families, to live in peace, and those principles that must protect humanity. That we do share.
We also share the idea that each nation must be respected in its own decisions. It's like we were saying a moment ago when we were talking about the prohibition of assault weapons. Of course, we do not want those weapons to be out in the streets, but at the same time, we want those decisions to come from the people themselves and to be self-determinant. And it's the same for Cuba. But I believe that the steps President Obama has taken are very positive.
Mexico is a good friend of Cuba, and Mexico is also a good friend of the United States. We want to be a good friend of Cuba and of the United States. We want both things. And we know that one day, the day that these principles we believe in prevail, that day we will be able to be neighbors, the three of us, the United States, Cuba, and Mexico.
What are the principles we believe in? Democracy, human rights, but also liberty, property, trade--free trade, free economy. And I think as long as those principles can function and bring benefits to the Cuban economy, then things can begin to change. We cannot change anything that has already taken place in the past, but I am certain that as heads of state, we can do a lot to try to make a different future, both for the world, both for our countries, and also in relation to Cuba.
I told President Obama--that the best of luck in this panorama that is now so totally different from what U.S. policy has been in the past. I hope for the best, and I hope that more expeditious steps could be taken so that we can move forward in this regard, and that everything will be done with good understanding. And as Mexico can contribute in any way for two of our friends to work out what they have between themselves, I hope that we can contribute. And if our best contribution is just to maintain our respect and our--that is fine.
Immigration Reform/Trade
Q. Good afternoon. For President Obama: Mr. President--[inaudible]--as U.S. Senator in 2006, voted in favor of the approval of the construction of the border wall. I would like to know, and I think Mexicans would like to know, what is your real commitment of your administration to present a new migratory--a comprehensive migratory reform? What would be its scope? And when would you approve this reform?
And on free trade, on NAFTA, it seems that because of the last events there's not a great deal of interest in the U.S. to apply or to comply with all the items in NAFTA. I would like to ask President Calderon whether you spoke of some of those issues during your conversations, whether you addressed the migratory issue and some of the NAFTA issues?
President Obama. Well, first of all, with respect to the immigration issue, I think you--it would be useful to point out that I also voted twice for comprehensive immigration reform that would have provided a pathway for legalization and an improvement of the orderly process of migration into the United States.
I've said before that we have to have a comprehensive approach, recognizing that the United States has a very legitimate concern. If you've got hundreds of thousands of people from other countries coming into the United States without anybody knowing who they are, who, when they arrive, can often be exploited and, because they're not protected by various laws, undermine the wages of U.S. workers, those are legitimate concerns on the part of the United States people and the United States Government. And so working effectively with the Mexican Government to create an orderly border is very important, and there are a whole host of strategies that we need to pursue.
What I've also said is that for those immigrants who are already in the United States--and by the way, we focus a lot on Mexicans who have come into the United States, but the number of immigrants from Central America, from Ireland, from Poland are substantial as well; it's not--this is not just an issue with respect to Mexico--with--for those immigrants who have put down roots, may have come there illegally, I think they need to pay a penalty for having broken the law. They need to come out of the shadows, and then we have to put them through a process where, if they want to stay in the United States, they have an opportunity over time to earn that opportunity for a legal status in the United States.
Now, we came close to getting that kind of reform done several years ago, and then it became politicized. And my whole goal is to remove the politics of this and take a very practical, commonsense approach that benefits people on both sides of the border and creates a secure and safe border so you don't have people who are dying in the deserts as a consequence of a disorderly and illegal migration process. I think that's a goal that President Calderon and I share and one that we discussed during our bilateral meeting.
With respect of trade, Mexico is one of our largest trading partners. The amount of commerce that flows back and forth creates wealth in Mexico, and it creates wealth in the United States. I have said repeatedly that I'm in favor of free trade. I know that there has been some concern about a provision that was placed in our stimulus package related to Mexican trucking. That wasn't a provision that my administration introduced, and I said at the time that we need to fix this, because the last thing we want to do at a time when the global economy is contracting and trade is shrinking is to resort to protectionist measures.
My team is working with President Calderon's team to resolve this issue. I'm hopeful that we can resolve it in an effective way. It's not helpful to a number of U.S. producers who are interested in selling into Mexico and are fearful that they may be subject to countervailing tariffs or retaliation. So we're going to see if we can get this fixed. But I can tell you that President Calderon and I are entirely on the same page in believing that we can create greater opportunities for trade and strengthen our commercial relationships between our two countries.
I have said before in the past, and I will continue to say, that as part of the NAFTA framework, that it would make sense for labor and environmental provisions to be enforceable within that agreement, rather than just be viewed as a side agreement. But I recognize that we are in a very difficult time right now economically on both sides of the border, and that those kinds of negotiations are going to need to proceed in a very careful and deliberate way, because we don't want to discourage trade; we want to encourage trade right now. So I'm confident that our administrations are going to be able to work together, and it's going to be to the benefit both of Mexico and the United States.
President Calderon. We spoke at length on migration and on trade, and particularly on the economy in general between both nations. President Obama is well aware, is very knowledgeable about the problem, and his position in favor of a comprehensive migratory reform is well known. I would simply repeat the idea--or refrain the idea that we share the objective of achieving an orderly, legal, productive migration between both countries.
I have said, and I maintain, that as a Mexican, as President of Mexico, it doesn't make me particularly happy to see our people risk their lives going across a border, because I know that with every migrant that leaves, we have the best of our people leaving; the youngest, the most courageous, the strongest, the hardest working, they are the ones that are leaving. Because I have seen in many communities here in Mexico, and particularly the state I come from, Michoacan, where there are phantom towns now, where there are only the elderly, children, women, and no one else is left there.
So I am working hard to create in Mexico the conditions, the opportunities of work, of employment for our people here in Mexico. That is really the only way out that can put a stop to migration. I think that is the best way out, to create opportunities and employment in our country. But in the meantime, President Obama is very clear on what the problem consists of, and it's very important to establish those instruments that will enable people to come out of the shadows, as he himself has said, and to--that our region can gradually become more orderly, more legal, and better migration flows.
I think the two of us share the idea that trade produces benefits on both sides of the border. Not only are there many Mexican workers that depend on their exports to the United States today--by the way, in a very delicate situation that we're going through because of the economic situation, the drop in the U.S. industry is very co-related to the drop in our Mexican industry--but there are also many workers in the United States that depend on the purchases that we make of U.S. products. Today, Mexican consumers are among the best buyers of U.S. products. Few consumers in the world buy as many U.S. products as we do here in Mexico.
So we must protect trade. And the best way of doing so is to allow it to flow naturally, with no restrictions. So beyond--going beyond the autonomous decisions that every country can take and the legitimate exercise of the rights that are part of the pacts and agreements that we have in order to protect free trade, I agree with President Obama, we have to go further. We have to go beyond in order to improve trade between both our countries. And we do not want to restrict it. We can come to agreements. We might have certain differences. I believe that we can move a great deal forward in labor and environmental issues, but it concerns me that to reopen those things that have been proven to work well can merely create further obstacles and worsen the situation we have today.
Our focus today on practical matters, and this is why--let me just mention three things that I believe we can work on. One is infrastructure at the border. I have talked to President Obama; I have shown him a list of 200 infrastructure projects of a larger or smaller scale that can generate employment both in the U.S. and Mexico at the border and improve our competitiveness at the border. So we have focused on six projects of border bridges, border crossing points that can lead to further employment and prosperity for our people.
The second item is customs cooperation that will enable us to have better cooperation, more expeditious cooperation, with no drop in productivity, to maybe have one single customs form--whether we're talking about exports or imports from one country to another--to have one single form that will allow us to reduce bureaucracy and make trade more expeditious.
And then also, third, concrete measures to have a harmonization of standards. Certain U.S. products, for example, need to have the units measured in pounds, and here we need them measured in kilos or in grams; we need to be able to have standards. If certain requirements differ from--in our two countries, I think we have to work towards a harmonization of these requirements. So these practical matters that seem to be minor are actually quite important. And I think they can truly help us.
And let me wrap up by saying that one of the things we emphasize is that both of us are going through economic problems because of this international crisis that we're undergoing. But if we act intelligently, we will understand that if we improve the North American competitiveness as a region that entails Canada, United States, and Mexico, if we improve the competitive conditions of our entire region, vis-a-vis other regions such as Asia or Eastern Europe or the rest of Latin America, then I do believe we will be able to come out of this problem much, much faster. Trade means opportunities; it equal opportunities of employment and of prosperity for our peoples always, always, and particularly today in these times of crisis and economic difficulties.
President Obama is undergoing tremendous efforts to improve things in the United States, and he is exercising in international leadership to face this economic situation. We firmly support on our side this situation, doing everything we can in order to revert this critical situation. And I do believe one way to do it is by strengthening trade not restricting it."
"April 19, 2009",The President's News Conference in Port of Spain,Barack Obama,"Barack Obama, The President's News Conference in Port of Spain Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/286791",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-port-spain,"The President. Hey, guys. You guys have a seat. Thanks. This is nice. This is a nice view, huh? Oh, it's beautiful. Did you guys go out last night, by the way? [Laughter] Chuck Todd [NBC News], did I see you on the cruise ship? [Laughter]
Q. That wasn't me.
The President. All right. Well, we just concluded a very productive summit. And I want to thank the people of Trinidad and Tobago for their wonderful hospitality and their gracious welcome. I want to thank Prime Minister Manning and First Lady Manning, his Government, for the hospitality they've shown me and our entire delegation.
This summit's been held at a time of great challenge and great opportunity for the United States and the Americas. The consequences of a historic economic crisis are being felt across the hemisphere, putting new pressure on peoples and governments that are already strained. Migration to and from each of our nations has serious implications for all nations. The safety and security of our citizens is endangered by drug trafficking, lawlessness, and a host of other threats. Our energy challenge offers us a chance to unleash our joint economic potential, enhance our security, and protect our planet. And too many citizens are being denied dignity and opportunity and a chance to live out their dreams in Cuba and all across the hemisphere.
These are some of the issues I discussed here in Trinidad and Tobago with leaders like President Garcia of Peru, President Bachelet of Chile, President Uribe of Colombia, President Preval of Haiti, and Prime Minister Harper of Canada. The subject of many of these meetings and conversations has been launching a new era of partnership between our nations. Over the past few days, we've seen potential positive signs in the nature of the relationship between the United States, Cuba, and Venezuela. But as I've said before, the test for all of us is not simply words, but also deeds. I do believe that the signals sent so far provide at least an opportunity for frank dialog on a range of issues, including critical areas of democracy and human rights throughout the hemisphere.
Now, I do not see eye to eye with every regional leader on every regional issue, and I do not agree with everything that was said at this summit by leaders from other nations. But what we showed here is that we can make progress when we're willing to break free from some of the stale debates and old ideologies that have dominated and distorted the debate in this hemisphere for far too long. We showed that while we have our differences, we can, and must, work together in areas where we have mutual interests, and where we disagree we can disagree respectfully. We showed that there are no senior or junior partners in the Americas; that we're simply partners committed to advancing a common agenda and overcoming common challenges.
And that spirit of shared responsibility was reflected in the achievement of the summit and in the work that the United States has done in concert with nations across Americas. First, we're building on our unprecedented efforts in the United States and on the work that we did at the G-20 summit in London to jump-start job creation, reform a broken financial regulatory system, and put our economies on the path of sustainable growth and shared prosperity. We're tripling the International Monetary Fund's lending capacity. We're urging the Inter-American Development Bank to increase its current lending level, and the United States is launching a new Microfinance Growth Fund for the hemisphere that will make meaningful differences for businesses and entrepreneurs across America.
Over the past few days, we also discussed what we can do to ensure that the policies we pursue in our own countries advance and do not undercut our broader regional recovery. Together, these efforts will help drive economic expansion in the United States and across the hemisphere and ensure that we do not see an erosion of the progress that we've made to lift people out of poverty and into the middle class.
Second, we're acting boldly, we are acting swiftly, and we are acting in concert to combat threats that are endangering the safety and security of citizens across the Americas. This week I traveled to Mexico, where I met with President Calderon to advance our shared commitment to combating the drug cartels, stemming the southbound flow of guns and money, and protecting citizens on both sides of our common border.
We are also taking a number of other key steps in concert with our regional partners, so when I met with the Central American nations and the Caribbean nations, they had similar concerns, and we pledged to work together to defend our nations and keep our people safe. The United States is investing $30 million in enhanced security partnerships with Caribbean nations to ensure that they have the resources they need to combat drug traffickers seeking to enter their borders from Mexico and Central America. And I'm also making it a priority to ratify the Illicit Trafficking in Firearms Convention and to enhance cooperation with nations across the region to reduce the threat of existing weapons stockpiles.
Third, we're taking a critical step to drive our economic expansion, enhance our security, and protect the bounty and beauty of the hemisphere with a new energy-climate partnership of the Americas that I proposed. Through this partnership, we will harness the progress being made by nations across the hemisphere, from Brazil's work on biofuels, to Chile's investments in solar power, to Mexico's efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions, to El Salvador's work on geothermal energy.
This is a voluntary and flexible partnership that nations across this region are invited to join, a partnership that will enhance energy efficiency, improve our infrastructure, and support investments that can make energy more affordable. In doing so, we can create the jobs of the future, promote renewable sources of energy, and make the Americas a model for cooperation.
Now, meeting these challenges and seizing these opportunities will not be easy; it will not happen overnight. Our efforts to work together may be strained at times by disagreements, and one of the things that I think is going to be critical to do is to make sure that we are working with our respective teams to encourage implementation at a more granular level. Sometimes at these summits we have very lofty statements; there's got to be follow-through across the way.
But I firmly believe that if we're willing to break free from the arguments and ideologies of an earlier era and continue to act, as we have at this summit, with a sense of mutual responsibility and mutual respect and mutual interest, then each of our nations can come out of this challenging period stronger and more prosperous, and we can advance opportunity, equality, and security across the Americas.
So with that, let me take some questions. I'm going to start with Edna Schmidt at Univision.
Meetings With Central and South American Leaders
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. The spotlight on your visit here was on the handshake and smiles with Hugo Chavez, but we didn't see much interaction with some of the other leftist leaders of the region like Daniel Ortega, Rafael Correa, or Evo Morales, who yesterday accused the United States of still interfering in its affairs and, even though it's too soon, he says, of not seeing much of change. Did you have any private meetings with any of these leaders, and if so, can you tell us what was discussed?
The President. Well, I had meetings with all the leaders involved, including Daniel Ortega, who was the chairperson of the Central American meeting. I had very cordial conversations with President Morales and President Correa. And I think it's just that President Chavez is better at positioning the cameras.
And in all these conversations, here's what I emphasized: that we're not going to agree on every issue, but that as long as we are respectful of democratic processes, as long as we're respectful of principles of sovereignty for all nations, that we can find areas where we can work in common. And my sense is, if you talk to any of those leaders, that they would say that they feel encouraged about the possibility of a more constructive relationship.
Now, specifically on the Bolivia issue, I just want to make absolutely clear that I am absolutely opposed and condemn any efforts at violent overthrows of democratically elected governments, wherever it happens in the hemisphere. That is not the policy of our Government. That is not how the American people expect their Government to conduct themselves. And so I want to be as clear as possible on that.
But one of the things that I mentioned in both public remarks as well as private remarks is that the United States, obviously, has a history in this region that's not always appreciated from the perspective of some, but that what we need to do is try to move forward, and that I am responsible for how this administration acts, and we will be respectful to those democratically elected governments, even when we disagree with them.
Scott Wilson, Washington Post.
U.S. Foreign Policy
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You said during the summit that you were here not to debate the past. You also said we must learn from our history. You just referred to this history. What have you learned over 2 days of listening to leaders here about how U.S. policy is perceived in the region? And can you name a specific policy that you will change as a result of what you've heard?
The President. Well, I think that what was reemphasized in all the discussions that I had was a sense, on the one hand, that the United States is critical to the economic growth and opportunities in the region. Even the most vociferous critics of the United States also want to make sure that the United States economy is working and growing again, because there is extraordinary dependence on the United States for exports, for remittances.
And so in that sense people are rooting for America's success. I do think that there is a strain of thought in the region that, in the past, many of the problems surrounding economic growth and opportunity or the lack thereof resulted because of a too rigid application of a free market doctrine imposed by the IMF, what is termed the ""Washington consensus.""
I think in some cases, those issues have been addressed. At the G-20 summit, for example, we talked about the need to create a reformed international financial--set of international financial institutions that provide additional flexibility, provide more voice and vote to developing countries. In some cases, it may be just a carryover of knee-jerk anti-American sentiment or simply differences in terms of economic theories and how the economies should grow.
One thing that I thought was interesting--and I knew this in a more abstract way but it was interesting in very specific terms--hearing from these leaders who when they spoke about Cuba, talked very specifically about the thousands of doctors from Cuba that are dispersed all throughout the region and upon which many of these countries heavily depend. And it's a reminder for us in the United States that if our only interaction with many of these countries is drug interdiction, if our only interaction is military, then we may not be developing the connections that can, over time, increase our influence and have a beneficial effect when we need to try to move policies that have--are of concern to us forward in the region.
And I think that's why it's so important that in our interactions not just here in the hemisphere but around the world, that we recognize that our military power is just one arm of our power, and that we have to use our diplomatic and development aid in more intelligent ways so that people can see very practical, concrete improvements in the lives of ordinary persons as a consequence of U.S. foreign policy.
Chuck Todd.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Building a little bit, actually, on the answer that you had there, you've been--three continents now in the last 3 weeks, 40-odd world leaders that you've been in the same room with----
The President. Time to get home. [Laughter]
Q. Yes, exactly.
The President. I'm going to Iowa next week. [Laughter]
Q. Yes, talk about deja vu.
The President. Yes.
Q. What should--a lot of people are going to start trying to write about the ""Obama doctrine."" What should be--what are the pillars of that that you think people should be taking away? After observing you on the world stage the last 3 weeks, what are the pillars of the Obama doctrine?
The President. Well, you know, I will leave it up to you, Chuck, to write the definitive statement on Obamaism. But there are a couple of principles that I've tried to apply across the board. Number one, that the United States remains the most powerful, wealthiest nation on Earth, but we're only one nation, and that the problems that we confront, whether it's drug cartels, climate change, terrorism, you name it, can't be solved just by one country. And I think if you start with that approach, then you are inclined to listen and not just talk.
And so in all these meetings what I've said is, we have some very clear ideas in terms of where the international community should be moving. We have some very specific national interests, starting with safety and security, that we have to attend to, but we recognize that other countries have good ideas too, and we want to hear them. And the fact that a good idea comes from a small country like a Costa Rica should not somehow diminish the fact that it's a good idea. I think people appreciate that. So that's number one.
Number two, I think that--I feel very strongly that when we are at our best the United States represents a set of universal values and ideals--the idea of democratic practices, the idea of freedom of speech and religion, the idea of a civil society where people are free to pursue their dreams and not be imposed upon constantly by their government. So we've got a set of ideas that I think have broad applicability. But what I also believe is that other countries have different cultures, different perspectives, and are coming out of different histories, and that we do our best to promote our ideals and our values by our example.
And so if we are practicing what we preach and if we occasionally confess to having strayed from our values and our ideals, that strengthens our hand, that allows us to speak with greater moral force and clarity around these issues.
And again, I think people around the world appreciate that we're not suggesting we are holding ourselves to one set of standards and we're going to hold you to another set of standards; that we're not simply going to lecture you, but we're rather going to show through how we operate the benefits of these values and ideals.
And the--as a consequence of listening, believing that there aren't junior partners and senior partners in the international stage, I don't think that we suddenly transform every foreign policy item that's on the agenda. I know that in each of these meetings the question has been, well, did you get something specific? What happened here? What happened there?
Countries are going to have interests, and changes in foreign policy approaches by my administration aren't suddenly going to make all those interests that may diverge from ours disappear. What it does mean, though, is, at the margins, they are more likely to want to cooperate than not cooperate. It means that where there is resistance to a particular set of policies that we're pursuing, that resistance may turn out just to be based on old preconceptions or ideological dogmas that, when they're cleared away, it turns out that we can actually solve a problem.
And so we're still going to have very tough negotiations on a whole host of issues. In Europe, people believe in our plan for Afghanistan, but their politics are still such that it's hard for leaders to want to send more troops into Afghanistan. That's not going to change because I'm popular in Europe or leaders think that I've been respectful towards them. On the other hand, by having established those better relations, it means that among the population there's more confidence that working with the United States is beneficial, and they are going to try to do more than they might otherwise have done.
And here in this hemisphere, I think as a consequence of a summit like this, it becomes much easier for our friends--countries like Mexico or Colombia, that are stalwart partners with us on issues like drug trafficking--it becomes much easier for them to work with us because their neighbors and their populations see us as a force for good or at least not a force for ill.

Cuba
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You've heard from a lot of Latin America leaders here who want the U.S. to lift the embargo against Cuba. You've said that you think it's an important leverage to not lift it. But in 2004, you did support lifting the embargo. You said, it's failed to provide the source of raising standards of living, it's squeezed the innocent, and it's time for us to acknowledge that this particular policy has failed. I'm wondering, what made you change your mind about the embargo?
The President. Well, 2004, that seems just eons ago. What was I doing in 2004?
Q. Running for Senate.
The President. Is it while--I was running for Senate. There you go. Look, the--what I said and what I think my entire administration has acknowledged is, is that the policy that we've had in place for 50 years hasn't worked the way we want it to. The Cuban people are not free. And that's our lodestone, our North Star, when it come to our policy in Cuba.
It is my belief that we're not going to change that policy overnight, and the steps that we took, I think, were constructive in sending a signal that we'd like to see a transformation. But I am persuaded that it is important to send the signal that issues of political prisoners, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, democracy--that those continue to be important, that they're not simply something to be brushed aside.
What was remarkable about the summit was that every leader who was participating was democratically elected. We might not be happy with the results of some elections; we might be happier with others; we might disagree with some of the leaders, but they all were conferred the legitimacy of a country speaking through democratic channels. And that is not yet there in Cuba.
Now, I think that as a starting point, it's important for us not to think that completely ignoring Cuba is somehow going to change policy, and the fact that you had Raul Castro say he's willing to have his Government discuss with ours not just issues of lifting the embargo, but issues of human rights, political prisoners, that's a sign of progress.
And so we're going to explore and see if we can make some further steps. There are some things that the Cuban government could do. They could release political prisoners. They could reduce charges on remittances to match up with the policies that we have put in place to allow Cuban American families to send remittances. It turns out that Cuba charges an awful lot; they take a lot off the top. That would be an example of cooperation where both governments are working to help Cuban families and raise standards of living in Cuba.
So there are going to be some ways that the Cuban Government, I think, can send some signals that they're serious about pursuing change. And I'm hopeful that over time the overwhelming trend in the hemisphere will occur in Cuba as well. And I think that all of the governments here were encouraged by the fact that we had taken some first steps. Many of them want us to go further, but they at least see that we are not dug in into policies that were formulated before I was born.
Bill Plante [CBS News]. No? Bill is not here? That's shocking. [Laughter] Dan [Dan Lothian] from CNN. Where's Dan?
U.S. Foreign Policy
Q. During the campaign you were criticized by some within your own party for perhaps not being able to be tough on foreign policy matters. Now you've had this friendly interaction with Mr. Chavez. Are you concerned at all about how this might be perceived back in the U.S. as perhaps being too soft? Already one Senator is calling this friendly interaction irresponsible. And as a quick follow-up, if I may, when you got the book from Mr. Chavez, what did you really think? [Laughter]
The President. I think it was a nice gesture to give me a book; I'm a reader. And you're right, we had this debate throughout the campaign, and the whole notion was that somehow if we showed courtesy or opened up dialog with governments that had previously been hostile to us, that that somehow would be a sign of weakness. The American people didn't buy it. And there's a good reason the American people didn't buy it, because it doesn't make sense.
You take a country like Venezuela--I have great differences with Hugo Chavez on matters of economic policy and matters of foreign policy. His rhetoric directed at the United States has been inflammatory. There have been instances in which we've seen Venezuela interfere with some of the countries that surround Venezuela in ways that I think are a source of concern.
On the other hand, Venezuela is a country whose defense budget is probably 1/600th of the United States. They own CITGO. It's unlikely that as a consequence of me shaking hands or having a polite conversation with Mr. Chavez that we are endangering the strategic interests of the United States. I don't think anybody can find any evidence that that would do so. Even within this imaginative crowd, I think you would be hard-pressed to paint a scenario in which U.S. interests would be damaged as a consequence of us having a more constructive relationship with Venezuela.
So if the question, Dan, is, how does this play politically, I don't know. One of the benefits of my campaign and how I've been trying to operate as President is, I don't worry about the politics. I try to figure out what's right in terms of American interests, and on this one I think I'm right.
Julianna [Julianna Goldman, Bloomberg News], who, by the way, I saw getting jostled a lot during the photo sprays. Cameramen, I just want you to know. [Laughter]
National Economy/U.S. Banking System
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to ask a question about an issue back home about the economy and the stress tests and whether or not you expect that along with the stress tests, with the results next month, that one or more executives will be asked to step down as it was with the auto restructuring plans.
The President. Okay, well, I don't want to speculate ahead of the release of the stress test numbers. I think what you'll see is that, not surprisingly, different banks are in different situations. They're going to need different levels of assistance from taxpayers and, as I've said before, if taxpayer money is involved then I've got a responsibility to ensure some transparency and accountability in the operations of those businesses. We try to use as light a touch as we can, but I'm not going to simply put taxpayer money into a black hole where you're not going to see results or some exit strategy, so that taxpayers, ultimately, are relieved of these burdens.
We've seen, I think, some progress in certain parts of the banking sector. As I mentioned before, I'm encouraged by the number of refinancings and mortgages that's already taking place, but I have also said we're not out of the woods. This is still a difficult time for the economy. Credit is still contracted; banks still are not lending at previous levels; the nonbank sector that accounted for 40 percent of credit prior to this crisis still hasn't recovered the way it should. And we're still having to take a series of extraordinary steps.
So we'll have more information as these stress test numbers are provided. I haven't seen all of them yet. They're being completed, I think, while we were on this trip. But I'm sure that we'll have more to say about this over the next several days. Okay?
April [April Ryan, American Urban Radio Networks]. What, you look surprised. [Laughter] Come on, April; I hope you've got a good question.
United Nations World Conference against Racism
Q. I've got some good--I have two, actually.
The President. All right, well, you only get one, though. [Laughter]
Q. I'll take that one. Well, Mr. President, as you're concluding your summit here and the meeting in Mexico, there is a U.S.--a U.N. conference, the world conference on racism in Geneva tomorrow. The U.S. is boycotting. And what say you about that? And is Zionism a main issue in the reason why the U.S. is boycotting the racism conference?
The President. Well, let me, first of all, say that I believe in the United Nations. I believe in the possibility of the United Nations serving as an effective forum to deal with a whole host of transnational conflicts. And so I want to be as encouraging as I can, and I've said that to the General-Secretary. For that reason, we're actually--have pursued a seat on the Human Rights Commission, the U.N. Human Rights Commission, because even though up until this point we haven't been very pleased with how it's operated, we think that it's worthwhile for us to go in there and try to make it into a constructive organization because of the extraordinary range of human rights violations that exist around the world. And I think America should be a leader; we can't opt out of those discussions.
Now, in that same spirit, I would love to be involved in a useful conference that addressed continuing issues of racism and discrimination around the globe, which, by the way, are not a particular province of any one country. Obviously, we've had our own experiences with racial discrimination, but if you come down to Central and South America and the Caribbean, they have all kinds of stories to tell about racial discrimination.
Somebody mentioned earlier President Morales. Whatever I think about his politics, the fact that he is the first indigenous--person of indigenous background to be elected in a country that has a enormous indigenous population indicates how much work remains to be done around the world.
So we would love to engage constructively in a discussion like that. Here's the problem: You had a previous conference--I believe it was in 2001, maybe it was 2002--I think it was 2001--in which it became a session through which folks expressed antagonism towards Israel in ways that were oftentimes completely hypocritical and counterproductive. And we expressed in the run-up to this conference our concerns that if you incorporated--if you adopted all the language from 2001, that's just not something we could sign up for.
So if we have a clean start, a fresh start, we're happy to go. If you're incorporating a previous conference that we weren't involved with that raised a whole set of objectionable provisions, then we couldn't participate, or it wouldn't be worth it for us to participate because we couldn't get past that particular issue.
And unfortunately, even though I think other countries made great efforts to accommodate some of our concerns and assured us that this conference would be more constructive, our participation would have involved putting our imprimatur on something that we just don't believe.
So what we've said--and I said this to Secretary-General Moon who was here addressing the summit--we're happy to work with them to see if we can move forward on some of these issues. Hopefully some concrete steps come out of the conference that we can partner with other countries on to actually reduce discrimination around the globe. But this wasn't an opportunity to do it.
So--okay? I think the--it's warm, and I've got to get home. But I appreciate you guys. Thank you.
By the way, whose wallet is this? Is this one of my staff's here? Did you guys put this on--is that yours, Marvin? That was to prop up my remarks? Okay, I don't want you to forget it. Thank you, guys.
Iranian American Journalist Incarcerated in Iran
Q. Mr. President, you haven't addressed the Iranian journalist. I think people would like to hear about that.
The President. I will. Obviously, I am gravely concerned with her safety and well-being. We are working to make sure that she is properly treated and to get more information about the disposition of her case.
She is an American citizen, and I have complete confidence that she was not engaging in any sort of espionage. She is an Iranian American who was interested in the country which her family came from, and it is appropriate for her to be treated as such and to be released.
We are going to be in contact with--through our Swiss intermediaries--with the Iranian Government and want to ensure that we end up seeing a proper disposition of this case.
Okay? Thanks. Thank you, guys."
"April 29, 2009",The President's News Conference,Barack Obama,"Barack Obama, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/286938",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1124,"The President. Please be seated. Before we begin tonight, I just want to provide everyone with a few brief updates on some of the challenges we're dealing with right now.
First, we are continuing to closely monitor the emergency cases of the H1N1 flu virus throughout the United States. As I said this morning, this is obviously a very serious situation, and every American should know that their entire Government is taking the utmost precautions and preparations. Our public health officials have recommended that schools with confirmed or suspected cases of this flu strongly consider temporarily closing. And if more schools are forced to close, we've recommended that both parents and businesses think about contingency plans if their children do have to stay home.
I've requested an immediate $1.5 billion in emergency funding from Congress to support our ability to monitor and track this virus and to build our supply of antiviral drugs and other equipment, and we will also ensure that those materials get to where they need to be as quickly as possible.
And finally, I've asked every American to take the same steps you would take to prevent any other flu: Keep your hands washed; cover your mouth when you cough; stay home from work if you're sick; and keep your children home from school if they're sick.
We'll continue to provide regular updates to the American people as we receive more information, and everyone should rest assured that this Government is prepared to do whatever it takes to control the impact of this virus.
The second thing I'd like to mention is how gratified I am that the House and the Senate passed a budget resolution today that will serve as an economic blueprint for this Nation's future. I especially want to thank Leader Reid, Speaker Pelosi, all the Members of Congress who worked so quickly and effectively to make this blueprint a reality.
This budget builds on the steps we've taken over the last 100 days to move this economy from recession to recovery and, ultimately, to prosperity. We began by passing a Recovery Act that has already saved or created over 150,000 jobs and provided a tax cut to 95 percent of all working families. We passed a law to provide and protect health insurance for 11 million American children whose parents work full time. And we launched a housing plan that has already contributed to a spike in the number of homeowners who are refinancing their mortgages, which is the equivalent of another tax cut.
But even as we clear away the wreckage of this recession, I've also said that we can't go back to an economy that's built on a pile of sand, on inflated home prices and maxed-out credit cards, on overleveraged banks and outdated regulations that allow recklessness of a few to threaten the prosperity of all.
We have to lay a new foundation for growth, a foundation that will strengthen our economy and help us compete in the 21st century. And that's exactly what this budget begins to do. It contains new investments in education that will equip our workers with the right skills and training, new investments in renewable energy that will create millions of jobs and new industries, new investments in health care that will cut costs for families and businesses, and new savings that will bring down our deficit.
I also campaigned on the promise that I would change the direction of our Nation's foreign policy, and we've begun to do that as well. We've begun to end the war in Iraq, and we forged with our NATO allies a new strategy to target Al Qaida in Afghanistan and Pakistan. We have rejected the false choice between our security and our ideals by closing the detention center at Guantanamo Bay and banning torture without exception. And we've renewed our diplomatic efforts to deal with challenges ranging from the global economic crisis to the spread of nuclear weapons.
So I think we're off to a good start, but it's just a start. I'm proud of what we've achieved, but I'm not content. I'm pleased with our progress, but I'm not satisfied. Millions of Americans are still without jobs and homes, and more will be lost before this recession is over. Credit is still not flowing nearly as freely as it should. Countless families and communities touched by our auto industry still face tough times ahead. Our projected long-term deficits are still too high. And Government is still not as efficient as it needs to be. We still confront threats ranging from terrorism to nuclear proliferation as well as pandemic flu. And all this means you can expect an unrelenting, unyielding effort from this administration to strengthen our prosperity and our security in the second 100 days and the third 100 days and all the days after that.
You can expect us to work on health care reform that will bring down costs while maintaining quality, as well as energy legislation that will spark a clean energy revolution. I expect to sign legislation by the end of this year that sets new rules of the road for Wall Street, rules that reward drive and innovation as opposed to shortcuts and abuse. And we will also work to pass legislation that protects credit card users from unfair rate hikes and abusive fees and penalties. We'll continue scouring the Federal budget for savings and target more programs for elimination, and we will continue to pursue procurement reform that will greatly reduce the no-bid contracts that have wasted so many taxpayer dollars.
So we have a lot of work left to do. It's work that will take time, and it will take effort. But the United States of America, I believe, will see a better day. We will rebuild a stronger nation, and we will endure as a beacon for all those weary travelers beyond our shores who still dream that there's a place where all this is possible.
I want to thank the American people for their support and their patience during these trying times, and I look forward to working with you in the next 100 days and the 100 days after that, all the hundreds of days to follow, to make sure that this country is what it can be.
And with that, I will start taking some questions, and I'll start with you, Jennifer [Jennifer Loven, Associated Press].
Global Influenza Outbreak
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. With the flu outbreak spreading and worsening, can you talk about whether you think it's time to close the border with Mexico, and whether--under what conditions you might consider quarantining, when that might be appropriate?
The President. Well, first of all, as I said, this is a cause for deep concern but not panic. And I think that we have to make sure that we recognize that how we respond--intelligently, systematically, based on science and what public health officials have to say--will determine in large part what happens.
I've consulted with our public health officials extensively on a day-to-day basis, in some cases, an hour-to-hour basis. At this point, they have not recommended a border closing. From their perspective it would be akin to closing the barn door after the horses are out, because we already have cases here in the United States. We have ramped up screening efforts as well as made sure that additional supplies are there on the border so that we can prepare in the eventuality that we have to do more than we're doing currently.
But the most important thing right now that public health officials have indicated is that we treat this the same way that we would treat other flu outbreaks, just understanding that because this is a new strain we don't yet know how it will respond. So we have to take additional precautions, essentially, take out some additional insurance. Now, that's why I asked for an additional $1.5 billion, so that we can make sure that everything is in place should a worst-case scenario play out.
I do want to compliment Democrats and Republicans who worked diligently back in 2005 when the bird flu came up. I was part of a group of legislators who worked with the Bush administration to make sure that we had beefed up our infrastructure and our stockpiles of antiviral drugs like Tamiflu. And I think the Bush administration did a good job of creating the infrastructure so that we can respond. For example, we've got 50 million courses of antiviral drugs in the event that they're needed.
So the Government is going to be doing everything that we can. We're coordinating closely with State and local officials. Secretary Napolitano at Department of Homeland Security, newly installed Secretary Sebelius of Health and Human Services, our Acting CDC Director, they are all on the phone on a daily basis with all public health officials across the States to coordinate and make sure that there's timely reporting, that if as new cases come up that we are able to track them effectively, that we're allocating resources so that they're in place.
The key now, I think, is to make sure that we are maintaining great vigilance, that everybody responds appropriately when cases do come up, and individual families start taking very sensible precautions that can make a huge difference. So wash your hands when you shake hands. Cover your mouth when you cough. I know it sounds trivial, but it makes a huge difference. If you are sick, stay home. If your child is sick, keep them out of school. If you are feeling certain flu symptoms, don't get on an airplane. Don't get on any system of public transportation where you're confined and you could potentially spread the virus.
So those are the steps that I think we need to take right now. But understand that because this is a new strain, we have to be cautious. If this was a strain that we were familiar with, then we might have to--then I think we wouldn't see the kind of alert levels that we're seeing, for example, with the World Health Organization. Okay?
Deb Price of Detroit News. Where's Deb? Good to see you.
U.S. Auto Industry
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. On the domestic auto industry, have you determined that bankruptcy is the only option to restructure Chrysler? And do you believe that the deep cuts and plant closings that were outlined this week by General Motors are sufficient?
The President. Let me speak to Chrysler first, because the clock is ticking on Chrysler coming up with a plan. I am actually very hopeful, more hopeful than I was 30 days ago, that we can see a resolution that maintains a viable Chrysler auto company out there. What we've seen is, the unions have made enormous sacrifices, on top of sacrifices that they had previously made. You've now seen the major debtholders come up with a set of potential concessions that they can live with. All that promises the possibility that you can get a Fiat-Chrysler merger and that you have an ongoing concern. The details have not yet been finalized so I don't want to jump the gun, but I'm feeling more optimistic than I was about the possibilities of that getting done.
With respect to GM, we're going to have another 30 days. They're still in the process of presenting us with their plans. But I've always said that GM has a lot of good product there, and if they can get through these difficult times and engage in some of the very difficult choices that they've already made, that they can emerge a strong, competitive, viable company.
And that's my goal in this whole process. I would love to get the U.S. Government out of the auto industry--auto business as quickly as possible. We have a circumstance in which a bad recession compounded some great weaknesses already in the auto industry. And it was my obligation, and continues to be my obligation, to make sure that any taxpayer dollars that are in place to support the auto industry are aimed not at short-term fixes that continue these companies as wards of the state, but rather institutes the kind of restructuring that allows them to be strongly competitive in the future. I think we're moving in that direction.
The last point, you asked about Chrysler bankruptcy. It was the prudent and appropriate thing for Chrysler to do to engage in the filings that they--that received some notice a while back, because they had to prepare for possible contingencies. It's not yet clear that they're going to have to use it. The fact that the major debtholders appear ready to make concessions means that even if they ended up having to go through some sort of bankruptcy, it would be a very quick type of bankruptcy, and they could continue operating and emerge on the other side in a much stronger position.
So my goal is to make sure that we've got a strong, viable, competitive auto industry. I think some tough choices are being made. There's no denying that there's significant hardship involved, particularly for the workers and the families in these communities, and we're going to be coming behind whatever plan is in place to make sure that the Federal Government is providing as much assistance as we have to ensure that people are landing back on their feet, even as we strengthen these core businesses. Okay?

Terrorist Interrogation Procedures
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You've said in the past that waterboarding, in your opinion, is torture. And torture is a violation of international law and the Geneva Conventions. Do you believe that the previous administration sanctioned torture?
The President. What I've said, and I will repeat, is that waterboarding violates our ideals and our values. I do believe that it is torture. I don't think that's just my opinion; that's the opinion of many who have examined the topic. And that's why I put an end to these practices. I am absolutely convinced it was the right thing to do, not because there might not have been information that was yielded by these various detainees who were subjected to this treatment, but because we could have gotten this information in other ways, in ways that were consistent with our values, in ways that were consistent with who we are.
I was struck by an article that I was reading the other day talking about the fact that the British during World War II, when London was being bombed to smithereens, had 200 or so detainees. And Churchill said, ""We don't torture,"" when the entire British--all of the British people were being subjected to unimaginable risk and threat. And the reason was that Churchill understood, you start taking shortcuts, and over time, that corrodes what's best in a people; it corrodes the character of a country.
And so I strongly believe that the steps that we've taken to prevent these kinds of enhanced interrogation techniques will make us stronger over the long term and make us safer over the long term, because it will put us in a position where we can still get information. In some cases, it may be harder, but part of what makes us, I think, still a beacon to the world is that we are willing to hold true to our ideals even when it's hard, not just when it's easy.
At the same time, it takes away a critical recruitment tool that Al Qaida and other terrorist organizations have used to try to demonize the United States and justify the killing of civilians. And it makes us--it puts us in a much stronger position to work with our allies in the kind of international coordinated intelligence activity that can shut down these networks.
So this is a decision that I am very comfortable with. And I think the American people, over time, will recognize that it is better for us to stick to who we are, even when we're taking on a unscrupulous enemy.
Okay. I'm sorry.
Q. Sir, I'm sorry. Do you believe that the previous administration sanctioned torture?
The President. I believe that waterboarding was torture. And I think that the--whatever legal rationales were used, it was a mistake.
Mark Knoller [CBS Radio].
Q. Thank you, sir. Let me follow up, if I may, on Jake's question. Did you read the documents recently referred to by former Vice President Cheney and others, saying that the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques not only protected the Nation, but saved lives? And if part of the United States were under imminent threat, could you envision yourself ever authorizing the use of those enhanced interrogation techniques?
The President. I have read the documents. Now, they haven't been officially declassified and released, and so I don't want to go into the details of them. But here's what I can tell you: That the public reports and the public justifications for these techniques--which is that we got information from these individuals that were subjected to these techniques--doesn't answer the core question, which is, could we have gotten that same information without resorting to these techniques? And it doesn't answer the broader question: Are we safer as a consequence of having used these techniques?
So when I made the decision to release these memos and when I made the decision to bar these practices, this was based on consultation with my entire national security team and based on my understanding that, ultimately, I will be judged as Commander in Chief on how safe I'm keeping the American people. That's the responsibility I wake up with, and it's the responsibility I go to sleep with.
And so I will do whatever is required to keep the American people safe, but I am absolutely convinced that the best way I can do that is to make sure that we are not taking shortcuts that undermine who we are. And there have been no circumstances during the course of this first 100 days in which I have seen information that would make me second-guess the decision that I've made. Okay?

Pakistan
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to move to Pakistan. Pakistan appears to be at war with the Taliban inside their own country. Can you reassure the American people that, if necessary, America could secure Pakistan's nuclear arsenal and keep it from getting into the Taliban's hands or, worst-case scenario, even Al Qaida's hands?
The President. I'm confident that we can make sure that Pakistan's nuclear arsenal is secure, primarily, initially, because the Pakistani army, I think, recognizes the hazards of those weapons falling into the wrong hands. We've got strong military-to-military consultation and cooperation. I am gravely concerned about the situation in Pakistan not because I think that they're immediately going to be overrun and the Taliban would take over in Pakistan; more concerned that the civilian Government there right now is very fragile and don't seem to have the capacity to deliver basic services: schools, health care, rule of law, a judicial system that works for the majority of people. And so as a consequence, it is very difficult for them to gain the support and the loyalty of their people.
So we need to help Pakistan help Pakistanis. And I think that there's a recognition increasingly on the part of both the civilian Government there and the army that that is their biggest weakness.
On the military side, you're starting to see some recognition just in the last few days that the obsession with India as the mortal threat to Pakistan has been misguided, and that their biggest threat right now comes internally. And you're starting to see the Pakistan military take much more seriously the armed threat from militant extremists.
We want to continue to encourage Pakistan to move in that direction, and we will provide them all the cooperation that we can. We want to respect their sovereignty, but we also recognize that we have huge strategic interests, huge national security interests in making sure that Pakistan is stable, and that you don't end up having a nuclear armed militant state.
Q. But in a worst-case scenario----
The President. I'm not going to engage----
Q. ----military, U.S. military could secure this nuclear arsenal?
The President. I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals of that sort. I feel confident that that nuclear arsenal will remain out of militant hands. Okay?
Jeff Mason [Reuters].
Iraq
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. One of the biggest changes you've made in the first 100 days regarding foreign policy has had to do with Iraq. But due to the large scale--this large-scale violence there right now, does that affect the U.S. strategy at all for withdrawal, and could it affect the timetable that you've set out for troops?
The President. Well, first of all, I think it's important to note that although you've seen some spectacular bombings in Iraq that are a legitimate cause of concern, civilian deaths, incidents of bombings, et cetera, remain very low relative to what was going on last year, for example. And so you haven't seen the kinds of huge spikes that you were seeing for a time. The political system is holding and functioning in Iraq.
Part of the reason why I called for a gradual withdrawal as opposed to a precipitous one was precisely because more work needs to be done on the political side to further isolate whatever remnants of Al Qaida in Iraq still exist. And I'm very confident that with our commander on the ground, General Odierno, with Chris Hill, our new Ambassador having been approved and already getting his team in place, that they are going to be able to work effectively with the Maliki Government to create the conditions for an ultimate transfer after the national elections.
But there's some serious work to do on making sure that how they divvy up oil revenues is ultimately settled; what the Provincial powers are and boundaries; the relationship between the Kurds and the central Government; the relationship between the Shi'a and the Kurds; are they incorporating effectively Sunnis, Sons of Iraq into the structure of the armed forces in a way that's equitable and just. Those are all issues that have not been settled the way they need to be settled. And what we've done is we've provided sufficient time for them to get that work done. But we've got to keep the pressure up, not just on the military side, but on the diplomatic and development sides as well.

Senator Arlen Specter/Cooperation With Congress
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. On Senator Specter's switch to the Democratic Party, you said you were thrilled. I guess nobody should be surprised about that. But how big a deal is this, really? Some Republicans say it is huge. They believe it's a game-changer. They say that if you get the 60 votes in the Senate, that you will be able to ride roughshod over any opposition, and that we're on the verge of, as one Republican put it, ""one-party rule."" Do you see it that way? And also, what do you think his switch says about the state of the Republican Party?
The President. Well, first of all, I think very highly of Arlen Specter. I think he's got a record of legislative accomplishment that is as good as any Member of the Senate. And I think he's always had a strong independent streak. I think that was true when he was a Republican; I think that will be true when he's a Democrat. He was very blunt in saying I couldn't count on him to march lockstep on every single issue. And so he's going to still have strong opinions, as many Democrats in the Senate do. I've been there. It turns out, all the Senators have very strong opinions, and I don't think that's going to change.
I do think that having Arlen Specter in the Democratic caucus will liberate him to cooperate on critical issues like health care, like infrastructure and job creation, areas where his inclinations were to work with us, but he was feeling pressure not to. And I think the vote on the Recovery Act was a classic example. Ultimately, he thought that was the right thing to do, and he was fiercely berated within his own party at the time for having taken what I considered to be a very sensible step. So I think it's overall a positive.
Now, I am under no illusions that suddenly I'm going to have a rubber-stamp Senate. I've got Democrats who don't agree with me on everything, and that's how it should be. Congress is a coequal branch of Government. Every Senator who's there, whether I agree with them or disagree with them, I think, truly believes that they are doing their absolute best to represent their constituencies. And we've got regional differences, and we've got some parts of the country that are affected differently by certain policies, and those have to be respected, and there's going to have to be compromise and give-and-take on all of these issues.
I do think that, to my Republican friends, I want them to realize that me reaching out to them has been genuine. I can't sort of define bipartisanship as simply being willing to accept certain theories of theirs that we tried for 8 years and didn't work and the American people voted to change. But there are a whole host of areas where we can work together.
And I've said this to people like Mitch McConnell. I said, look, on health care reform, you may not agree with me that I--we should have a public plan; that may be philosophically just too much for you to swallow. On the other hand, there are some areas, like reducing the cost of medical malpractice insurance, where you do agree with me. If I'm taking some of your ideas--and giving you credit for good ideas--the fact that you didn't get a hundred percent can't be a reason every single time to oppose my position. And if that is how bipartisanship is defined--a situation in which, basically, wherever there are philosophical differences I have to simply go along with ideas that have been rejected by the American people in a historic election--we're probably not going to make progress.
If, on the other hand, the definition is that we're open to each other's ideas, there are going to be some differences, the majority will probably be determinative when it comes to resolving just hard-core differences that we can't resolve, but there's a whole host of other areas where we can work together, then I think we can make progress.
U.S. Political System
Q. Is the Republican Party in the desperate straits that Arlen Specter seems to think it is?
The President. You know, politics in America changes very quick, and I'm a big believer that things are never as good as they seem and never as bad as they seem. You're talking to a guy who was 30 points down in the polls during a primary in Iowa, so I never--I don't believe in crystal balls. I do think that our administration has taken some steps that have restored confidence in the American people that we're moving in the right direction, and that simply opposing our approach on every front is probably not a good political strategy.

Abortion Rights
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. In a couple of weeks you're going to be giving the commencement at Notre Dame and, as you know, this has caused a lot of controversy among Catholics who are opposed to your position on abortion. As a candidate you vowed that one of the very first things you wanted to do was sign the freedom of choice act, which, as you know, would eliminate Federal, State, and local restrictions on abortion. And at one point in the campaign, when asked about abortion and life, you said that it was above--quote, ""above my pay grade."" Now that you've been President for a hundred days, obviously, your pay grade is a little higher than when you were a Senator--[laughter]--do you still hope that Congress quickly sends you the freedom of choice act so you can sign it?
The President. You know, the--my view on abortion, I think, has been very consistent. I think abortion is a moral issue and an ethical issue. I think that those who are pro-choice make a mistake when they--if they suggest--and I don't want to create straw men here, but I think there are some who suggest that this is simply an issue about women's freedom, and that there's no other considerations. I think, look, this is an issue that people have to wrestle with and families and individual women have to wrestle with.
The reason I'm pro-choice is because I don't think women take that issue--that position casually. I think that they struggle with these decisions each and every day, and I think they are in a better position to make these decisions, ultimately, than Members of Congress or a President of the United States, in consultation with their families, with their doctors, with their clergy. So that's been my consistent position.
The other thing that I said consistently during the campaign is, I would like to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies that result in women feeling compelled to get an abortion or at least considering getting an abortion, particularly if we can reduce the number of teen pregnancies, which has started to spike up again. And so I've got a task force within the Domestic Policy Council in the West Wing of the White House that is working with groups both in the pro-choice camp and in the pro-life camp to see if we can arrive at some consensus on that.
Now, the freedom of choice act is not my highest legislative priority. I believe that women should have the right to choose, but I think that the most important thing we can do to tamp down some of the anger surrounding this issue is to focus on those areas that we can agree on. And that's where I'm going to focus.

The President's First 100 Days
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. During these first 100 days, what has surprised you the most about this office, enchanted you the most about serving this in office, humbled you the most, and troubled you the most?
The President. All right, let me write this down. [Laughter]
Q. Surprised, troubled----
The President. I've got--what was the first one?
Q. Surprised.
The President. Surprised.
Q. Troubled.
The President. Troubled.
Q. Enchanted.
The President. Enchanted? Nice. [Laughter]
Q. And humbled.
The President. And what was the last one, humbled?
Q. Humbled. Thank you, sir.
The President. All right. Okay. [Laughter] Surprised--I am surprised compared to where I started, when we first announced for this race, by the number of ","critical issues that appear to be coming to a head all at the same time. You know, when I first started this race, Iraq was a central issue, but the economy appeared on the surface to still be relatively strong. There were underlying problems that I was seeing with health care for families and our education system and college affordability and so forth, but, obviously, I didn't anticipate the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.
And so the typical President, I think, has two or three big problems; we've got seven or eight big problems. And so we've had to move very quickly, and I'm very proud of my team for the fact that we've been able to keep our commitments to the American people to bring about change while, at the same time, managing a whole host of issues that had come up that weren't necessarily envisioned a year and a half ago.
Troubled? I'd say less troubled, but sobered by the fact that change in Washington comes slow, that there is still a certain quotient of political posturing and bickering that takes place even when we're in the middle of really big crises. I would like to think that everybody would say, you know what, let's take a timeout on some of the political games, focus our attention for at least this year, and then we can start running for something next year. And that hasn't happened as much as I would have liked.
Enchanted? [Laughter] Enchanted--I will tell you that when I meet our service men and women, enchanted is probably not the word I would use. [Laughter] But I am so profoundly impressed and grateful to them for what they do. They're really good at their job. They are willing to make extraordinary sacrifices on our behalf. They do so without complaint. They are fiercely loyal to this country. And the more I interact with our service men and women, from the top brass down to the lowliest private, I'm just--I'm grateful to them.
Humbled by the fact that the Presidency is extraordinarily powerful, but we are just part of a much broader tapestry of American life. And there are a lot of different power centers, and so I can't just press a button and suddenly have the bankers do exactly what I want or turn on a switch and suddenly Congress falls in line. And so what you do is to make your best arguments, listen hard to what other people have to say, and coax folks in the right direction.
This metaphor has been used before, but the ship of state is an ocean liner, it's not a speed boat. And so the way we are constantly thinking about this issue of how to bring about the changes that the American people need is to say, if we can move this big battleship a few degrees in a different direction, we may not see all the consequences of that change a week from now or 3 months from now, but 10 years from now or 20 years from now, our kids will be able to look back and say that was when we started getting serious about clean energy; that's when health care started to become more efficient and affordable; that's when we became serious about raising our standards in education.
And so I have a much longer time horizon than I think you do when you're a candidate or if you're listening, I think, to the media reportage on a day-to-day basis.
And I'm humbled, last, by the American people, who have shown extraordinary patience and, I think, a recognition that we're not going to solve all these problems overnight. Okay?
Lori Montenegro [Telemundo].
Immigration Reform
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, when you met with the Hispanic caucus a few weeks ago, reports came out that the White House was planning to have a forum to talk about immigration and bring it to the forefront. Going forward, my question is, what is your strategy to try to have immigration reform? And are you still on the same timetable to have it accomplished in the first year of your Presidency? And also, I'd like to know if you're going to reach out to Senator John McCain, who is Republican and in the past has favored immigration reform?
The President. Well, we reach out to Senator McCain on a whole host of issues. He has been a leader on immigration reform. I think he has had the right position on immigration reform, and I would love to partner with him and others on what is going to be a critical issue. We've also worked with Senator McCain on what I think is a terrific piece of legislation that he and Carl Levin have put together around procurement reform. We want that moved, and we're going to be working hard with them to get that accomplished.
What I told the congressional Hispanic caucus is exactly what I said the very next day in a town hall meeting and what I will continue to say publically, and that is, we want to move this process. We can't continue with a broken immigration system. It's not good for anybody. It's not good for American workers. It's dangerous for Mexican would-be workers who are trying to cross a dangerous border. It is putting a strain on border communities who oftentimes have to deal with a host of undocumented workers, and it keeps those undocumented workers in the shadows, which means they can be exploited at the same time as they're depressing U.S. wages.
So what I hope to happen is that we're able to convene a working group, working with key legislators, like Luis Gutierrez and Nydia Velazquez and others, to start looking at a framework of how this legislation might be shaped. In the meantime, what we're trying to do is take some core--some key administrative steps to move the process along, to lay the groundwork for legislation, because the American people need some confidence that if we actually put a package together we can execute.
So Janet Napolitano, who has great knowledge of this because of having been a border Governor, she's already in the process of reviewing and figuring out how can we strengthen our border security in a much more significant way than we're doing. If the American people don't feel like you can secure the borders, then it's hard to strike a deal that would get people out of the shadows and on a pathway to citizenship who are already here, because the attitude of the average American is going to be, well, you're just going to have hundreds of thousands of more coming in each year. On the other hand, showing that there's a more thoughtful approach than just raids of a handful of workers, as opposed to, for example, taking seriously the violations of companies that sometimes are actively recruiting these workers to come in, that's, again, something that we can start doing administratively.
So what we want to do is to show that we are competent in getting results around immigration, even on the structures that we already have in place, the laws that we already have in place, so that we're building confidence among the American people that we can actually follow through on whatever legislative approach emerges. Okay?
Q. Do you feel confident that it will get passed in the first year of your administration?
The President. I see the process moving this first year, and I'm going to be moving it as quickly as I can. I've been accused of doing too much. We are moving full steam ahead on all fronts. Ultimately, I don't have control of the legislative calendar. And so we're going to work with legislative leaders to see what we can do.
Andre Showell [Black Entertainment Television]. There you go.
Effect of Economic Situation on Minority Communities
Q. Thank you. Mr. President, as the entire Nation tries to climb out of this deep recession, in communities of color the circumstances are far worse. The black unemployment rate, as you know, is in the double digits. And in New York City, for example, the black unemployment rate for men is near 50 percent.
My question tonight is, given this unique and desperate circumstance, what specific policies can you point to that will target these communities? And what's a timetable for us to see tangible results?
The President. Well, keep in mind that every step we're taking is designed to help all people. But folks who are most vulnerable are most likely to be helped because they need the most help. So when we passed the Recovery Act, for example, and we put in place provisions that would extend unemployment insurance or allow you to keep your health insurance, even if you've lost your job, that probably disproportionately impacted those communities that had lost their jobs.
And unfortunately, the African American community and Latino community are probably overrepresented in those ranks. When we put in place additional dollars for community health centers to ensure that people are still getting the help that they need, or we expand health insurance to millions more children through the Children's Health Insurance Program, again, those probably disproportionately impact African American and Latino families simply because they're the ones who are most vulnerable. They've got higher rates of uninsured in their communities.
So my general approach is that if the economy is strong, that will lift all boats, as long as it is also supported by, for example, strategies around college affordability and job training, tax cuts for working families as opposed to the wealthiest that level the playing field and ensure bottom-up economic growth. And I'm confident that that will help the African American community live out the American Dream at the same time that it's helping communities all across the country. Okay?
Michael Scherer of Time.
State Secrets Doctrine
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. During the campaign you criticized President Bush's use of the state secrets privilege. But U.S. attorneys have continued to argue the Bush position in three cases in court. How exactly does your view of state secrets differ from President Bush's? And do you believe Presidents should be able to derail entire lawsuits about warrantless wiretapping or rendition, if classified information is involved?
The President. I actually think that the state secret doctrine should be modified. I think right now it's overbroad. But keep in mind, what happens is, we come into office, we're in for a week, and suddenly, we've got a court filing that's coming up. And so we don't have the time to effectively think through what, exactly, should a overarching reform of that doctrine take. We've got to respond to the immediate case in front of us.
I think it is appropriate to say that there are going to be cases in which national security interests are genuinely at stake, and that you can't litigate without revealing covert activities or classified information that would genuinely compromise our safety. But searching for ways to redact, to carve out certain cases, to see what can be done so that a judge in chambers can review information without it being in open court, you know, there should be some additional tools so that it's not such a blunt instrument. And we're interested in pursuing that. I know that Eric Holder and Greg Craig, my White House Counsel, and others are working on that as we speak.
Jonathan Weisman [Wall Street Journal], you get the last word. Where are you? There you are. Yes.
Government Role in U.S. Auto Industry and Banking System
Q. Thank you, sir. You are currently the chief shareholder of a couple of very large mortgage giants. You're about to become the chief shareholder of a car company, probably two. And I'm wondering what kind of shareholder are you going to be? What is the Government's role as the keeper of public trust in bonds in soon-to-be public companies again? Thank you.
The President. Well, I think our first role should be shareholders that are looking to get out. You know, I don't want to run auto companies; I don't want to run banks. I've got two wars I've got to run already. I've got more than enough to do. [Laughter] So the sooner we can get out of that business, the better off we're going to be.
We are in unique circumstances. You had the potential collapse of the financial system, which would have decimated our economy, and so we had to step in. As I've said before, I don't agree with every decision that was made by the previous administration when it came to TARP, but the need for significant intervention was there, and it was appropriate that we moved in.
With respect to the auto companies, I believe that America should have a functioning, competitive auto industry. I don't think that taxpayers should simply put--attach an umbilical cord between the U.S. Treasury and the auto companies so that they are constantly getting subsidies. But I do think that helping them restructure at this unique period when sales--you know, the market has essentially gone from 14 million down to 9 million--I don't think that there's anything inappropriate about that.
My goal on all this is to help these companies make some tough decisions based on realistic assumptions about economic growth, about their market share, about what that market is going to look like, to prevent systemic risk that would affect everybody, and as soon as their situations are stabilized and the economy is less fragile, so that those systemic risks are diminished, to get out, find some private buyers. And----
Q. But would you shape the products and services that are on offer?
The President. I don't think that we should micromanage. But I think that like any investor, the American taxpayer has the right to scrutinize what's being proposed and to make sure that their money is not just being thrown down the drain.
And so we've got to strike a balance. I don't want to be--I'm not an auto engineer, I don't know how to create a affordable, well-designed plug-in hybrid. But I know that if the Japanese can design a affordable, well-designed hybrid, then doggone it, the American people should be able to do the same. So my job is to ask the auto industry, why is it you guys can't do this? And in some cases they're starting to do it, but they've got these legacy costs. There are some terrific U.S. cars being made, both by Chrysler and GM. The question is, you know, give me a plan so that you're building off your strengths and you're projecting out to where that market is going to be.
I actually think, if you look at the trends, that those auto companies that emerge from this crisis, when you start seeing the pent-up demand for autos coming back, they're going to be in a position to really do well globally, not just here in the United States. So I just want to help them get there.
But I want to disabuse people of this notion that somehow we enjoy meddling in the private sector. If you could tell me right now that when I walked into this office that the banks were humming, that the autos were selling, and that all you had to worry about was Iraq, Afghanistan, North Korea, getting health care passed, figuring out how to deal with energy independence, deal with Iran, and a pandemic flu, I would take that deal. [Laughter]
And that's why I'm always amused when I hear these criticisms of, ""Oh, Obama wants to grow government."" No. I would love a nice, lean portfolio to deal with, but that's not the hand that's been dealt us. And every generation has to rise up to the specific challenges that confront them. We happen to have gotten a big set of challenges, but we're not the first generation that that's happened to. And I'm confident that we're going to meet these challenges just like our grandparents and forebears met them before.
All right. Thank you, everybody."
"August 10, 2009","The President's News Conference With President Felipe de Jesus Calderon Hinojosa of Mexico and Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada in Guadalajara, Mexico",Barack Obama,"Barack Obama, The President's News Conference With President Felipe de Jesus Calderon Hinojosa of Mexico and Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada in Guadalajara, Mexico Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/286965",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-felipe-de-jesus-calderon-hinojosa-mexico-and,"President Calderon. Right honorable Mr. Stephen Harper, Prime Minister of Canada, Right Honorable Mr. Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the media, national as well as international: The leaders from the United States, Canada, and Mexico have completed two fruitful workdays for the benefit of our conationals. The leaders for North America share the vision and insight for one—for only regional community that is safe, secure, and competitive, that can face successfully the challenges of the present and the future.
We coincide in pointing out that in an age marked by globalization, the challenges can only be overcome jointly, thus the importance of keeping the dialogue, trust, and cooperations amongst our three countries. Americans, Canadians, and Mexicans have reiterated that the values upon which our societies are founded are democracy, freedom, justice, and the respect of human rights.
Our three nations have reiterated our decision to combat and struggle of the transnational organized crime in order to bring about more security to our communities. The struggles we have led in Mexico for the rule of law and the security of our Mexican people forces us to stop the traffic of weapons and of money that go from north to south that strengthen and nourish organized crime gangs. The notions of responsibility, coresponsibility, accountability, the exchange of information, and the building of our institutions should be the guidelines for our cooperation.
In this international crisis context, the three states that make up the North American region have to take the leadership and foster and boost the necessary measures to recover our economic growth. In our task, we have had to implement countercyclical measures in the three countries that have been put into action. And in a coordinated manner, we can stabilize our economies and thus bring about trustworthiness and certainty in regard to the future of the global economy.
It is also necessary to build our financial international institutions such as the World Fund, the International Monetary Fund, which are fundamental to guarantee the flow of the financial resources. In the case of Latin America, the support that will enable us to recapitalize the Inter-American Bank for Development will be the best action for help and commitment in regard to the poor countries in the region on behalf of the North American countries.
I am certain that at the next G-20 meeting that shall take place in Pittsburgh, United States, will be a great opportunity to build the necessary agreements to reform these organizations that are key in the recovery of our economies and our reprisal. I thank President Obama for fostering this meeting in Pittsburgh.
And likewise, the United States, Mexico, and Canada have to restart our agreements. We recognize that it is essential to abide by NAFTA and to resolve the pending topics that impede us to reach greater regional competitiveness. And it is important to see how we are going to fulfill our commitments in regard to the environment and in regard to our labor domains linked to the commercial agreements, the trade agreements we have amongst our countries. I am convinced that only in tapping the advantages offered by our economic complementarities, in terms of investments, labor, technologies, and natural resources, we shall be successful in a world that is ferociously competing.
At this summit, we have reached important agreements such as boosting the standardization of the regulations and certifications of our products, as well as the sanitary procedures and fight to sanitary procedures that can be simplified, as well as increasing without any losses, increasing the economic competitiveness of our region. The objective is to have in—secure and efficient conditions, these procedures to be implemented with no bureaucratic or far-fetched redtape in our offices. And this will diminish—decrease the prices for the staples and food and improve the competitiveness of our economies.
On the other hand, on the bilateral aspects, Mexico and the United States will launch modernization initiatives at our common borders with determined terms in order to promote the regional competitiveness actions. And Mexico commends and is pleased to say that we're going to inaugurate the first international bridge that is currently being built after so many years between the United States and Mexico.
The United States, Mexico, and Canada have coincided in the importance to face the repercussions of pragmatic change. The cost is very high, but the price we shall pay for lack of actions is not to be calculated—cannot possibly be calculated. We coincide that we have to foster the global agreement in Copenhagen and the instrumentation for a green fund that will finance and support mitigation and adaptation actions in regard to the global scale of the climatic change. We need to make progress in regard to clean energies and technologies, as well as the development of our carbon bonus market in order to have a regional market. North America has to be recognized as a responsible region and must set the example for the world in terms of environmental cooperation amongst countries with different levels of development.
Cooperation and solidarity amongst the North American region has to prevail at all moments, and thus it was demonstrated last April when our three countries faced the emergence of this new virus, A1H1—HN1. And working together, we showed our highest expressions of responsibility, accountability, and transparency. And because we alerted timely the other regions in the hemisphere, they had the opportunity to implement preventive measures in order to abate the propagation of the virus and to avoid as far as possible its lethal repercussions. H1N1, as we know, will be back this winter. We are getting prepared, all three countries, to face in a responsible manner this contingency and abate its impacts for our people.
First Minister, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, at this summit, the representatives of the United States, Canada, and Mexico have held an open and straightforward dialogue as corresponds countries that share values, that were to consolidate the right conditions for development, and that have been able to found a successful society based on brotherly and responsible relationships. We believe in a North American region that is united, that is prosperous and wealthy, that is able to build a better future for the forthcoming generations.
And I want to give the floor now to Mr. Stephen Harper, Prime Minister for Canada.
Prime Minister Harper. Thank you, President Calderon. Thank you to the Mexican people for their hospitality, for their warmth. And thank you to President Obama for your straightforward exchanges, so positive on our priorities. These stakes consisted mainly of the economy, health, and security in the North American region and consisted—and focused on energy, environment, and climate change in regard to the North American economy and the global economy.
And thanks to the solid results in Canada with regard to financial regulations and fiscal actions—have been very positive contribution. It's been important that since we are getting close to the G-20 meeting, we have to underscore that countries have to go on with the reinforcement of their financial national/international institutions and to take the timely financial measures and to keep the markets open and to resist against protectionism.
In regard to the health domain and in regard to the influenza A1H1, it has been a threat, but the excellent cooperation amongst our three countries has helped us to restrain the repercussions of this plague, and we shall focus on that even more.
In regard to security, Canada recognizes the courageous commitment taken by President Calderon to combat organized crime in Mexico. We commend him for his efforts and since his actions have touched all of us.
And we are still making the greatest efforts in Canada to find a pacific resolution for Honduras. We have to reinstate the democratic governance and the rule of law in that country.
In regard to the energy and the climate change, and since our economies are integrated, we have discussed about the importance of working together on a North American focus against the climate change and in order to assure and guarantee a new international covenant that is efficient and truly global.
And to finish, Canada, the United States, and Mexico are good neighbors and good friends too. As sovereign countries in a modern world, we are independent and interdependent both, and I can't wait to see it at the G-20 and to welcome you at the summit in Canada for the leaders of North America next year.
[At this point, Prime Minister Harper continued in English.]
Just once again, thanks to President Calderon and to the Mexican people for their hospitality. Thanks also to President Obama for our candid and constructive exchanges on our priority issues. Those priority issues fitted into three broad categories: the economy; North American health and security; and energy, environment, and climate change.
On the economy, because of Canada's strong record of financial—on financial regulation and fiscal management, we provided an informed voice at these meetings. As we approach the G-20 summit in Pittsburgh, we continue to emphasize that countries must strengthen financial regulations and institutions, continue to implement timely economic stimulus, and maintain open markets to resist protectionism.
On North America health and security, we talked about our shared and effective response thus far to H1N1. It is a cross-border threat to all of us. The excellent cooperation among these our three countries was effective in helping to manage the initial outbreak, and we will continue our cooperative efforts.
On security, Canada recognizes the courageous commitment of President Calderon in taking on the drug traffickers. We are supporting these efforts, as it is a shared challenge for all of us in North America.
Also, on international peace and security, Canada supports ongoing OAS efforts to find a peaceful resolution to the political crisis in Honduras. We must restore both democratic governance and the rule of law.
To—sorry, excuse me, I just about missed energy and climate change. Given the integrated nature of our economies, we did talk at some length about the importance of working together on a North American approach to climate change and also on doing our best to ensure that out of Copenhagen and going forward we reach an effective and genuinely international new world protocol on greenhouse gas emissions.
To conclude, Canada, the United States, and Mexico are good neighbors and also good friends. As sovereign countries in a modern world, we are both independent and interdependent. I'm looking forward to seeing both President Calderon and President Obama at the G-20, looking forward to hosting both of you next year at Canada's summit in our great country.
Thank you.
President Obama. Good morning, and buenos dias. I want to thank my great friend President Calderon for his hospitality and for hosting us at this important summit, as well as my good friend Prime Minister Stephen Harper. And I want to thank the people of Guadalajara and Mexico for the incredible warmth they've shown us on this my second trip to Mexico as President.
Here in Mexico the word is juntos, and in Canada it's ensemble, but no matter how we say it, we come here today—three nations, one continent—because of the challenges and opportunities that we will be facing together.
Like our magnificent surroundings today, this city could not be a more fitting venue. Here in Guadalajara, we see all the richness of Mexico's heritage: its arts, its architecture, its vitality, and its culture. And we also see all the possibilities of Mexico's future: the innovation, high-tech industries, and entrepreneurship that makes this one of our hemisphere's most dynamic cities.
Here in Guadalajara, we also see our continent coming together—Mexicans, Canadians, Americans—as tourists, as neighbors, educators, and business partners, each bringing their unique traditions, each bound by mutual respect. Indeed, in the 21st century, North America is defined not simply by our borders, but by our bonds. And that is the spirit that defined the very productive summit that we had here today.
First, we agreed that we had to work together to restore our common prosperity. The global recession has cost jobs and hurt families from Toronto to Toledo to Tijuana. So we renew our commitment to work together in Ottawa, Washington, and Mexico City. Building on our progress at the G-8 and G-20 summits, we agreed to continue to take aggressive, coordinated action to restore economic growth and create jobs for our workers, including workers in the North American auto industry.
Because so much of our common prosperity and millions of jobs depend on trade that flows across our borders—billions of dollars worth of trade every day—we reaffirmed the need to reject protectionism. We recommitted ourselves to the infrastructure investments, the commonsense regulations, and intellectual property protections upon which trade thrives. We are among each other's largest trading partners. As we work together towards lasting prosperity, we need to expand that trade, not restrict it.
I would note that our common prosperity also depends on orderly, legal migration. All three of our nations have been enriched by our ties of family and community. I think of my own brother-in law, who is Canadian. I think of the many Mexican Americans from Jalisco who have found a home in Los Angeles and Texas and in my hometown of Chicago. At the same time, Americans, Mexicans, and Canadians all expect their borders to be safe and secure. And that is why my administration will continue to work to fix America's broken immigration system in a way that is in keeping with our traditions of being both a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.
And because our future prosperity also depends on clean energy economies, we built on our bilateral efforts to invest in renewable energy and green jobs, and we recommitted ourselves to the historic goals announced last month in Italy. Nations like the United States and Canada will take the lead by reducing emissions by 80 percent by 2050, and we will work with other nations to cut global emissions in half. Indeed, we've made progress toward the concrete goals that will be negotiated at the Copenhagen climate change summit in December. And I again want to commend Mexico for its leadership in curbing greenhouse gas emissions and President Calderon for his innovative proposals to help developing countries build clean, sustainable economies.
Second, we reiterated our abiding commitment to the common safety and security of our people. In response to the H1N1 pandemic, our three governments have worked closely, collaboratively, and responsibly. With science as our guide, we resolved to continue taking all necessary preparations and precautions to prepare for the upcoming flu season and protect the health of our people. And this challenge transcends borders, and so must our response.
We also resolved to continue confronting the urgent threat to our common security from the drug cartels that are causing so much violence and death in our countries. As I've said on many occasions, I heartily commend President Calderon and his Government for their determination and courage in taking on these cartels. And the President reaffirmed his Government's commitment to transparency, accountability, and human rights as they wage this difficult but necessary fight.
The United States will remain a full partner in this effort. We will work to make sure Mexico has the support it needs to dismantle and defeat the cartels. And the United States will also meet its responsibilities by continuing our efforts to reduce the demand for drugs and continuing to strengthen the security of our shared border, not only to protect the American people but to stem the illegal southbound flow of American guns and cash that helps fuel this extraordinary violence.
Third, we reaffirmed our abiding commitment to our common values, including peace, democracy, and human rights. And in particular, we discussed the coup in Honduras. As has been mentioned, our three nations stand united on this issue. President Zelaya remains the democratically elected President. For the sake of the Honduran people, democratic and constitutional order must be restored. And we will continue to work with others, especially the Organization of American States, to achieve a negotiated and peaceful solution.
And finally, we pledged to continue all these efforts. I look forward to welcoming Prime Minister Harper to Washington in September. I look forward to welcoming both of my friends at the G-20 summit in Pittsburgh, where I hope to reciprocate President Calderon's hospitality.
Our progress today is a reminder that no nation can meet the challenges of our time on our own. Our common aspirations can only be achieved if we work together. And that's what the nearly half-billion people in North America expect from us, so that's what we will do.
Thank you very much.
Moderator. Let's move on to the question-and-answer session. This will be one question per country, and we'll start off with Mexico.
Mexico-U.S. Drug Control Cooperation/Immigration Reform/Human Rights in Mexico
Q. Good afternoon, heads of state. President Obama, there are certain questions about violation of human rights here in Mexico and all these problems of fighting drug trafficking. Are you going to certify Mexico? And how can we move forward with the Merida Initiative? We've also been concerned about any attempt against Felipe Calderon's life. We know about certain threats and insecurity that prevails. This, of course, is certainly related to your country. We're concerned about the visa problem too. But what comments would you have regarding all these questions?
President Obama. I didn't get a translation on that one. [Laughter] So it sounded like a very good question. [Laughter] Here, I think it's coming. Go ahead.
Q. We're concerned about the violation of human rights here in Mexico as we fight against drug trafficking. What are your concerns regarding this? And we'd also like to know if Mexico is going to be certified, and if you will help and apply resources for the Merida Initiative? We've also heard about some attempts against the life of President Felipe Hinojosa Calderon. Do you have any knowledge of this?
And we're also concerned about national security, we're concerned about visas, et cetera. We'd like to know, is there any possibility that you might turn this around, that we might not have any limit on visas?
President Obama. Well, the—I'll just address the first two questions that seem to apply to the United States. Number one, we have been very supportive of the Merida Initiative, and we will continue to be supportive. And we have already seen resources transferred, equipment transferred, in order to help President Calderon in what is a very courageous effort to deal with a drug cartel—set of drug cartels that are not only resulting in extraordinary violence to the people of Mexico but are also undermining institutions like the police and the judiciary system that, unless stopped, will be very damaging to the country.
Now, with respect to the conduct of this battle against the cartels, I have great confidence in President Calderon's administration applying the law enforcement techniques that are necessary to curb the power of the cartels, but doing so in a way that's consistent with human rights. And we discussed this in our bilateral meeting, and I am confident that as the national police are trained, as the coordination between the military and local police officials is improved, there is going to be increased transparency and accountability and that human rights will be observed.
The biggest, by far, violators of human rights right now are the cartels themselves that are kidnapping people and extorting people and encouraging corruption in these regions. That's what needs to be stopped. That's what President Calderon is committed to doing, and that's what I'm committed to helping President Calderon accomplish as long as he is President of Mexico.
Prime Minister Harper. Are you going to answer, or just me?
President Calderon. Do you want—[inaudible]—and I after?
Prime Minister Harper. Okay. On the question of visas, it's important to understand the imposition of visa is due to one thing and one thing only, and that is the dramatic rise we have seen over the last few years, and this year in particular, in the number of bogus refugee claims being made from Mexico into Canada.
It's important to understand that this decision, first of all, has nothing to do with the actions of the Mexican Government. The Mexican Government has cooperated with us in efforts to stem this particular problem, to limit this particular problem. It continues to work with us in ways we might reverse it.
But the underlying problem, as I've said to President Calderon and others, the underlying program—problem is in the Canadian refugee laws. It is simply far too easy in Canada to make a bogus refugee claim as a way of entering the country. And we have to change that. It is unfair to those who are legitimate refugees. It is also unfair to the hundreds of thousands of people who are working through our immigration system to become immigrants to this country—to our country.
So as I say, we will continue to work with Mexican authorities to try and limit this problem. But in the absence of legislative change, it is very difficult for our governments to control this other than through the imposition of visa. It is the only tool available to us right now. So we need additional tools from our Parliament to stem the flow of bogus refugee claimants and also to have additional tools to deal with this kind of problem.
President Calderon. Yes. Let me address these three topics, which were very important to us. First of all, my Government has an absolute and categorical commitment with human rights. The struggle, the battle we are fighting against organized crime is precisely to preserve the human rights of the Mexican people: right to safety, to security, to personal safety and integrity, and the right to have a safe family; the right to work without being really molested or perturbed; and the struggle for the security and safety of the Mexican people.
Obviously, we have a strong commitment to protect human rights of everybody, the victims and even of the criminals themselves. And this is how it has been, this is how it will continue to be, and this is how the federal police will act, the attorney generals and armed forces will act. In all of these cases, there have been a very scrupulous effort to try to protect human rights in all cases.
And anyone who says the contrary certainly would have to prove this—any case, just one case, where the proper authority has not acted in a correct way, that the competent authorities have not punished anyone who has abused their authority, whether they be police officers, whether they be soldiers, or anyone else. We have a clear commitment with human rights. We have met this commitment, and we will continue to do so, not because of any money that might come or come through the Merida Initiative or what's said in the U.S. Congress, because we have the strong commitment to human rights. And I certainly in a personal sense for several decades now, and I have always had this commitment.
I have some details about what you have pointed out, but in any case, it certainly won't be the first or the last occasion on which we might hear something about an attempt against my personal—about my life, my person. But once again, the Government just can't stop; it can't be deterred. We know that we are destroying their criminal organization. We're hitting them hard. We're hitting at the heart of their organizations. We're making them back away. And we know—they know that we're not only taking an initiative in the struggle against crime, but we are actually being able to protect, to defend our country better as time goes by.
This is not a type of vengeance, of getting back at anyone, but we want to make sure that Mexico is a safe place to live in, that we will be able to move forward in this—[inaudible]. We're not just talking about this organizations, but whether our basic objective is to provide security, safety for the Mexican people. This is something that Mexican people are entitled to, that their family, that their children can go out into the streets, they can go out to play, they can go to school, they can make progress and to fulfill their aspirations; that Mexico be a free country, free of delinquency, free of violence; that Mexico will be a safe country. And in this struggle, we're not going to be intimidated, nor are they going to put a stop to our efforts.
Once again, I certainly hope that Mexican society recognizes all of the efforts we're making along these lines, the police force who have been victims of attempts and of cowardly acts by the criminals, all the efforts carried out by Mexican marines, by soldiers, and the different attorney general's officers, because we are committed to this ideal to have a safe Mexico, to have a safe country. And these are values that we believe in, and it's certainly stronger than any threat that could be made against us, about any threat whatsoever.
So once again, we have had dialogues with Prime Minister Harper on several different occasions, as we did on this occasion, on—about the summit and the matter of visas for Mexican visitors. We've talked openly, frankly, and certainly—Mexico certainly feels very bad about this decision, about this rejection, even though, of course, it is a privilege of the Canadian Government to stipulate this. But it certainly gets in the way of a good relationship, of what Prime Minister Harper and I are doing to have good relations between our two countries. And the explanations that Prime Harper has mentioned, there certainly is a problem with this bogus refugee claim problem, and this has led to an abuse of the system.
So we're going to try to work together, to collaborate together. We're doing this here in Mexico to try to do away with the underlying causes of this abuse regarding the general system for receiving refugees in Canada.
Once again, for me it's very clear that as the President of Mexico, that I certainly have the obligation of ensuring that a specific topic on the bilateral agenda not deter reaching our full potential of other matters on the agenda.
And once again, here lies the great opportunity in this particular area of economic complementarities of the two—of the three countries' economies, and that this will take our whole region up to a higher state of competitiveness and to the benefit of our people. But these are the lines we've been working along, and I think we have been making great strides in this sense. And we certainly will continue to work along these lines in a frank and open way with Prime Minister Harper and President Obama.
Trade/Health Care
Q. Well, let me preface this by saying that we only get one question each, so I hope you will excuse me for being inexcusably longwinded. It's actually a two-parter. [Laughter] And the first part of this question is for the three leaders, primarily President Obama. And I'd appreciate it——
President Calderon. Could you use the microphone?
Q. And I would appreciate it if the Prime Minister, for the benefit of my Francophone colleagues, could answer in French as well.
The ""Buy American"" has caused considerable concern outside the United States. I am wondering what you discussed about ""Buy American"" at this meeting, and also what power you personally have to rescind this measure and whether you intend to use that power.
Now, on a not completely related topic, health care has been an issue of tremendous debate in your country, and Canadians have looked on with some fascination as our health care system has become a political football in your country. I'd like to ask Prime Minister Harper and President Obama whether there are elements of the Canadian health care system, particularly the public model, which are worth emulating.
President Obama. Well, first of all, with respect to the ""Buy American"" provisions, I want to assure you that your Prime Minister raises this with me every time we see each other. So that's important to note, that he is expressing, I think, his country's concerns.
I think it's also important to keep it in perspective that, in fact, we have not seen some sweeping steps towards protectionism. There was a very particular provision that was in our recovery package, our stimulus package. It did not extend beyond that. It was WTO compliant. It was not something that I thought was necessary, but it was introduced at a time when we had a very severe economic situation, and it was important for us to act quickly and not get bogged down in debates around this particular provision.
Prime Minister Harper and I have discussed this, and there may be mechanisms whereby States and local jurisdictions can work with the Provinces to allow for cross-border procurement practices that expand the trading relationship. But I do think it's important to keep this in perspective: This is—in no way has endangered the billions of dollars of trade taking place between our two countries. It's not a general provision, but it was restricted to a very particular aspect of our recovery package.
With respect to the health care debate, we are having a vigorous debate in the United States, and I think that's a healthy thing. The reason it's necessary is because we a","re on a currently unsustainable path. We spend far more per person on health care than any nation on Earth. The—our outcomes in terms of various measures of well being don't rank us at the top. We're not doing better than a lot of other advanced, developed countries that are spending much less per person.
Individual families are being bankrupted because of the lack of insurance. We've got 46, 47 million people without health insurance in our country. And for those who do have health insurance, they are always at risk of private insurers eliminating their insurance because of a preexisting condition or because of—they lose a job or they have changed jobs.
So the final aspect of it is, is that our health care inflation is going up so rapidly that our Federal budget simply can't sustain it, nor can businesses that are increasingly having to make decisions whether they hire more workers or eliminate health care, whether they stop providing coverage or they force more costs on to their workers. So the whole system is not working well.
Now, how do we change it? When it's one-sixth of the U.S. economy, there are going to be a lot of opinions. And Congress has moved forward, and we are closer to achieving a serious health reform package than we have been in the last 40 to 50 years. But there is going to continue to be a vigorous debate.
I've said that the Canadian model works for Canada; it would not work for the United States, in part simply because we've evolved differently. We have a employer-based system and a private-based health care system that stands side by side with Medicare and Medicaid and our Veterans Administration health care system. And so we've got to develop a uniquely American approach to this problem.
This, by the way, is a problem that all countries are going to have to deal with at some level because if medical inflation continues at the pace that it's going, everybody's budgets are going to be put under severe strain. And so what we're trying to do is make sure that we've got a sensible plan that provides coverage for everybody, that continues the role of the private marketplace, but provides people who don't have health insurance or have fallen through the cracks in the private marketplace a realistic and meaningful option. And we've got to do it in a way that also changes our delivery system so that we're not engaged in the kind of wasteful, inefficient medical spending that is so costly to us.
So I suspect that we're going to have continued vigorous debate. I suspect that you Canadians will continue to get dragged in by those who oppose reform, even though I've said nothing about Canadian health care reform. I don't find Canadians particularly scary, but I guess some of the opponents of reform think that they make a good boogeyman. I think that's a mistake. And I suspect that once we get into the fall and people look at the actual legislation that's being proposed, that more sensible and reasoned arguments will emerge, and we're going to get this passed.
Sorry to take so long on the question.
Prime Minister Harper. With respect to your first question, yesterday we discussed this problem. I'm very happy to recently see that it's an agreement among the Provinces and the federation to have a common front with respect to this problem. There have been a lot of discussions among American and Canadian ministers, ministers of trade, and also our public officials. These talks will continue once I meet again with President Obama over the next couple of months.
With respect to health care, the only thing I could say is the Canadians certainly support their own system, and the rest is really an American debate.
And it's up to the Provinces, for example, in Canada——
[Prime Minister Harper continued in English.]
On ""Buy American,"" we did have a good discussion, as President Obama said. I'm very happy to see that our Provinces and the Federal Government have recently come to an agreement to work collectively on this matter, which is largely, actually, within their jurisdiction since this concerns subnational procurement. Our respective trade ministers have been talking, officials are talking, and we anticipate, I anticipate that President Obama and I will be discussing this at greater length in our upcoming discussions.
On the American health care debate, on the debate over the system of health care, as we know, as you know well, Canadians support their own health care system. As for the rest of this question, my only answer is that this is an American debate and a responsibility of the Provinces.
Moderator. Ginger Thompson, New York Times.
Immigration Reform/Situation in Honduras/Border Security
Q. I'd like to start with President Obama, please. Given the fight that you're having to wage for health care, I wonder if you can tell us what you think the prospects are for immigration reform, for comprehensive immigration reform, which you've said is your goal, and whether you think that the blows you're taking now on health care and that the Democrats are likely to take around the midterm elections will make it hard, if not impossible, to achieve comprehensive immigration reform in this term, and what you've told President Calderon about that.
President Calderon, I'd like to hear a little bit about your thoughts on Honduras. There have been some in Latin America who have said that the United States has not acted strongly enough to return President Zelaya to power. And I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how you feel about what the United States should be doing or could be doing to restore democratic order in Honduras.
And, Prime Minister Harper, a few months ago, the Homeland Security Secretary of the United States went to Canada—or at least aggravated Canadian sensibilities when she compared the Canadian border to the Mexican border. And I wonder what you think about that and how you feel about the United States using some of the enforcement strategies adopted on the southern border in the north. Thank you.
President Obama. That's all? [Laughter]
Q. That's all, Mr. President.
President Obama. Well, first of all, Ginger, I don't know if you're doing some prognosticating about the outcome of the midterm elections, which are over a year away. I anticipate we'll do just fine. And I think when all is said on health care reform, the American people are going to be glad that we acted to change an unsustainable system so that more people have coverage, we're bending the cost curve, and we're getting insurance reform so that people don't get dropped because of preexisting conditions or other issues.
So understand, though, I'm not acting based on short-term political calculations. I'm looking at what's best for the country long term. If I had been making short-term political calculations, I wouldn't be standing here as President, because nobody calculated that I could win the Presidency.
With respect to immigration reform, I continue to believe that is also in the long-term interests of the United States. We have a broken immigration system. Nobody denies it. And if we continue on the path we're on, we will continue to have tensions with our Mexican neighbors; we will continue to have people crossing the borders in a way that is dangerous for them, unfair for those who are applying legally to immigrate; we're going to continue to have employers who are exploiting workers because they're not within a legal system and so, oftentimes, are receiving less than minimum wage or don't have overtime or being abused in other fashion. That's going to depress U.S. wages. It's causing ongoing tensions inside the United States. It's not fair, and it's not right, and we're going to change it.
Now, I've got a lot on my plate, and it's very important for us to sequence these big initiatives in a way where they don't all just crash at the same time. And what we've said is, in the fall when we come back, we're going to complete health care reform. We still have to act on energy legislation that has passed the House, but the Senate, I'm sure, is going to have its own ideas about how it wants to approach it. We still have financial regulatory reform that has to get done because we don't want a situation in which irresponsible actions in the global financial markets can precipitate another crisis. That's a pretty big stack of bills.
Fortunately, what we've been able to do is to begin meeting with both Democrats and Republicans from the House and the Senate. Secretary Napolitano is coordinating these discussions, and I would anticipate that before the year is out, we will have draft legislation along with sponsors potentially in the House and the Senate who are ready to move this forward, and when we come back next year, that we should be in a position to start acting.
Now, am I going to be able to snap my fingers and get this done? No. This is going to be difficult; it's going to require bipartisan cooperation. There are going to be demagogues out there who try to suggest that any form of pathway for legalization for those who are already in the United States is unacceptable. And those are fights that I'd have to have if my poll numbers are at 70 or if my poll numbers are at 40. That's just the nature of the U.S. immigration debate.
But ultimately, I think the American people want fairness. And we can create a system in which you have strong border security, we have an orderly process for people to come in, but we're also giving an opportunity for those who are already in the United States to be able to achieve a pathway to citizenship so that they don't have to live in the shadows and their children and their grandchildren can have a full participation in the United States. So I'm confident we can get it done.
Oh, excuse me, I know this wasn't directed at me, but I just want to make one quick point on Honduras, because you repeated something that I've heard before. The same critics who say that the United States has not intervened enough in Honduras are the same people who say that we're always intervening and Yankees need to get out of Latin America. You can't have it both ways.
We have been very clear in our belief that President Zelaya was removed from office illegally, that it was a coup, and that he should return. We have cooperated with all the international bodies in sending that message. Now, if these critics think that it's appropriate for us to suddenly act in ways that in every other context they consider inappropriate, then I think what that indicates is, is that maybe there's some hypocrisy involved in their approach to U.S.-Latin America relations that certainly is not going to guide my administration's policies.
President Calderon. Thank you. I will now make the most of this question. Now, in regard to migration, actually many of the people who work active in the United States, who live in the shadow, live in this State—or come from Jalisco, this State. These are people who have migrated in order to build a better future for their families. All of them, or most of them, have enormously contributed to the American society and the American economy, and it is unthinkable to see that the U.S., the main power, the main economic power in the world, without the contribution of the Mexican laborers and workers. This is not only a good will statement.
And in—during our meeting, we handed the delegations the benefits of North America and what the Mexican population represents in terms of age, in regard to the total population in the U.S. The only way to have sustained progress throughout the North American region, especially, is allowing for the natural economic processes, for integration can happen, and this implies the labor mobility that cannot be determined by mandate or by decree.
This is what we have underscored with President Obama during this meeting, to keep on invoking the protection for the Mexican laborers, whatever their migration conditions are in the United States, and our highest commendments to the way President Obama has tackled this migration issue now.
Aside from defending the rights of the Mexican laborers in the U.S., that one day instead of the Mexican people to have to leave their country because they're hungry or because they have to risk their lives, we need an economic scheme where we have great investments coming from the U.S., hailing from Canada, and opening here the labor opportunities that the Mexicans so need.
I think President Barack Obama has responded to the topic on—or to the issue on Honduras, whatever—what we have discussed and agreed as what needs to be done to build the international actions that have been taken in order to reestablish the democracy in Honduras, to strengthen the OAS and the delegation that is about to meet in Tegucigalpa, to build the mediation actions that Oscar Arias, President for Costa Rica and Nobel Peace—Nobel Prize, is carrying out in order to reestablish the constitutional law in Honduras.
This is not about a person or another. This is not about President Zelaya himself or per se. It is about the constitutional and democratic life that ought to be defended in regard to the international legal framework that we have all agreed upon.
And one more expression: I coincide in the contradiction highlighted by President Obama. Those who have rejected or who have argumented about the intervention of the United States in the region are those who now are claiming for the determination or the intervention of the U.S. in the region, no matter how legal this action might be.
So we have to resort to international law and international instances beyond the intervention of one single state—or even more, the intervention of one single person—to resolve such a dispute and such an issue. This is the path to be taken.
Today, we congratulate ourselves that President Obama is leading the administration of the United States. But in the past, that happened; but in the future, we don't know who might be President next. And I am not of those who share the idea that the U.S. are elected as the ultimate judge and the ultimate, sovereign resolver through the intermediation of the affairs in our countries.
Yes, we have to open the path to the OAS, to the international organizations, to the regional group that we have formed, such as the Rio Group, such as the groups that are friends of North America, the countries that are—that befriend Honduras, that befriend Central America, that befriend Guatemala. These countries must act on our own account, but in observance of the international law and the rules we have settled ourselves. We have to form a group of friends of Honduras that through—with the help of Oscar Arias and with the help of the OAS and their corresponding actions.
Prime Minister Harper. Just briefly, Minister Van Loan and Secretary Napolitano have been—and our officials have been meeting regularly on management of our shared border. I think we have a good, cooperative relationship in that regard. There's, obviously, always work to be done.
Let me be very clear: From the Canadian perspective, we look at our border as a line between the two closest countries on Earth. We have the largest trading relationship of any two countries on Earth, but we also share security concerns. I've said repeatedly, I say again, there is no such thing as a threat to the security of the United States which is not a threat to the security of Canada. That is why Canada has been a steadfast ally of the United States in NAFTA and NORAD for many, many years.
We want to address all the same security issues that the United States wants to address, and we want to do so in a way that doesn't impede commerce and doesn't impede the great social interaction which has made our two countries so close over the decades.
I'm just going to also weigh in a little bit, as a friend of the United States, on that question that was posed to President Obama. If I were an American, I would be really fed up with this kind of hypocrisy; you know, the United States is accused of meddling except when it's accused of not meddling, and the same types of—same types who are demanding the United States to somehow intervene in Honduras, the same type of people who would condemn longstanding security cooperation between Colombia and the United States, which is being done for legitimate security and drug traffic reasons that is, frankly—that are in the interests of all the countries of this hemisphere.
Mexico and Canada are involved in the mediation effort in supporting—directly supporting the mediation effort of President Arias. I think the United States has been a very—very forcefully articulated its concerns and its desired outcomes in that regard and has been very supportive of those of us who are working in the multilateral process to deal with this serious issue in the hemisphere. So I think that's precisely what we want to see from the United States, is a United States that leads on issues of values, but is very supportive of multilateral attempts to deal with challenges that we all face.
President Obama. Thank you.
President Calderon. Thank you. Gracias, todos."
"April 13, 2010",The President's News Conference,Barack Obama,"Barack Obama, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/288320",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1119,"The President. Good afternoon, everybody. We have just concluded an enormously productive day.
I said this morning that today would be an opportunity for our nations, both individually and collectively, to make concrete commitments and take tangible steps to secure nuclear materials so they never fall into the hands of terrorists, who would surely use them.
This evening I can report that we have seized this opportunity, and because of the steps we've taken, as individual nations and as an international community, the American people will be safer and the world will be more secure.
I want to thank all who participated in this historic summit: 49 leaders from every region of the world. Today's progress was possible because these leaders came not simply to talk, but to take action; not simply to make vague pledges of future action, but to commit to meaningful steps that they are prepared to implement right now.
I also want to thank my colleagues for the candor and cooperative spirit that they brought to the discussions. This was not a day of long speeches or lectures on what other nations must do. We listened to each other with mutual respect. We recognized that while different countries face different challenges, we have a mutual interest in securing these dangerous materials.
So today is a testament to what is possible when nations come together in a spirit of partnership to embrace our shared responsibility and confront a shared challenge. This is how we will solve problems and advance the security of our people in the 21st century. And this is reflected in the communique that we have unanimously agreed to today.
First, we agreed on the urgency and seriousness of the threat. Coming into this summit, there were a range of views on this danger. But at our dinner last night and throughout the day, we developed a shared understanding of the risk.
Today we are declaring that nuclear terrorism is one of the most challenging threats to international security. We also agreed that the most effective way to prevent terrorists and criminals from acquiring nuclear materials is through strong nuclear security, protecting nuclear materials and preventing nuclear smuggling.
Second, I am very pleased that all the nations represented here have endorsed the goal that I outlined in Prague 1 year ago: to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in 4 years time. This is an ambitious goal, and we are under no illusions that it will be easy. But the urgency of the threat and the catastrophic consequences of even a single act of nuclear terrorism demand an effort that is at once bold and pragmatic. And this is a goal that can be achieved.
Third, we reaffirmed that it is the fundamental responsibility of nations, consistent with their international obligations, to maintain effective security of the nuclear materials and facilities under our control. This includes strengthening national laws and policies and fully implementing the commitments we have agreed to.
And fourth, we recognized that even as we fulfill our national responsibilities, this threat cannot be addressed by countries working in isolation. So we've committed ourselves to a sustained, effective program of international cooperation on national security, and we call on other nations to join us.
It became clear in our discussions that we do not need lots of new institutions and layers of bureaucracy. We need to strengthen the institutions and partnerships that we already have and make them even more effective. This includes the United Nations, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the multilateral partnership that strengthens nuclear security, prevent nuclear trafficking, and assist nations in building their capacity to secure their nuclear materials.
But as I said, today was about taking tangible steps to protect our people. So we've also agreed to a detailed work plan to guide our efforts going forward, the specific actions we will take. I want to commend my partners for the very important commitments that they made in conjunction with this summit. Let me give some examples.
Canada agreed to give up a significant quantity of highly enriched uranium. Chile has given up its entire stockpile. Ukraine and Mexico announced that they will do the same. Other nations, such as Argentina and Pakistan, announced new steps to strengthen port security and prevent nuclear smuggling.
More nations, including Argentina, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, agreed to join, and thus strengthen, the treaties and international partnerships that are at the core of our global efforts. A number of countries, including Italy, Japan, India, and China, will create new centers to promote nuclear security technologies and training. Nations pledged new resources to help the IAEA meet its responsibilities.
In a major and welcome development, Russia announced that it will close its last weapons-grade plutonium production reactor. After many years of effort, I'm pleased that the United States and Russia agreed today to eliminate 68 tons of plutonium for our weapons programs, plutonium that would have been enough for about 17,000 nuclear weapons. Instead, we will use this material to help generate electricity for our people.
These are exactly the kinds of commitments called for in the work plan that we adopted today, so we've made real progress in building a safer world.
I would also note that the United States has made its own commitments. We are strengthening security at our own nuclear facilities and will invite the IAEA to review the security at our neutron research center. This reflects our commitment to sharing the best practices that are needed in our global efforts. We're seeking significant funding increases for programs to prevent nuclear proliferation and trafficking.
And today the United States is joining with our Canadian partners in calling on nations to commit $10 billion to extending our highly successful global partnership to strengthen nuclear security around the world.
So this has been a day of great progress. But as I said this morning, this can't be a fleeting moment. Securing nuclear materials must be a serious and sustained global effort. We agreed to have our experts meet on a regular basis to measure progress, to ensure that we're meeting our commitments, and to plan our next steps.
And I again want to thank President Lee and the Republic of Korea for agreeing to host the next Nuclear Security Summit in 2 years.
Finally, let me say, while this summit's focused on securing nuclear materials, this is part of a larger effort: the comprehensive agenda that I outlined in Prague last year to pursue the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons. Indeed, in recent days, we've made progress on every element of this agenda.
To reduce nuclear arsenals, President Medvedev and I signed the historic new START Treaty, not only committing our two nations to significant reductions in deployed nuclear weapons, but also setting the stage for further cuts and cooperation between our countries.
To move beyond outdated cold war thinking and to focus on the nuclear dangers of the 21st century, our new Nuclear Posture Review reduces the role and number of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy. And for the first time, preventing nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism is at the top of America's nuclear agenda, which reaffirms the central importance of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
And next month in New York, we will join with nations from around the world to strengthen the NPT as the cornerstone of our global efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, even as we pursue greater civil nuclear cooperation. Because for nations that uphold their responsibilities, peaceful nuclear energy can unlock new advances in medicine, in agriculture, and economic development.
All of these efforts are connected. Leadership and progress in one area reinforces progress in another. When the United States improves our own nuclear security and transparency, it encourages others to do the same, as we've seen today. When the United States fulfills our responsibilities as a nuclear power committed to the NPT, we strengthen our global efforts to ensure that other nations fulfill their responsibilities.
So again, I want to thank my colleagues for making this unprecedented gathering a day of unprecedented progress in confronting one of the greatest threats to our global security. Our work today not only advances the security of the United States, it advances the security of all mankind. And preventing nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism will remain one of my highest priorities as President of the United States.
So with that, I'm going to take a few questions, and I'm going to start with Bill Plante from CBS.
Nuclear Security Summit Commitments
Q. Mr. President, thank you. The communique states in no uncertain terms that all of the unprecedented cooperation for which you're calling will be done on a voluntary basis, not a binding commitment. What's the likelihood that countries which have been at odds over these issues for a number of years are now going to cooperate? How can this be enforced?
The President. Well, let's just take a specific example, Bill. For about 10 years, we had been encouraging Ukraine to either ship out its highly enriched uranium or transform it to a lower grade--a lower enriched uranium. And in part because of this conference, Ukraine took that step, announced that it would complete this step over the next couple of years.
So all the commitments that we talked about are ones that we've already booked, even before the communique and the work plan gets put into place. And that indicates the degree to which I think that there's actually strong unanimity about the importance of this issue as a threat to the global and international community.
Now, keep in mind that we also have a number of international conventions that have been put in place. Not all of them have been ratified. In fact, the United States needs to work on a couple of these conventions dealing with the issues of nuclear terrorism and trafficking. But what this does is it sets out a bold plan. And what I'm encouraged about is the fact that we've already seen efforts that had been delayed for years--in some cases, since the end of the cold war--actually finally coming to fruition here at this summit.
Q. It all depends on good will, sir.
The President. Bill, the point is that we've got world leaders who have just announced that, in fact, this is a commitment that they're making. I believe they take their commitments very seriously.
If what you're asking is, is do we have a international, ""one world"" law enforcement mechanism, we don't. We never have.
All right? So in all of our efforts internationally, in every treaty that we sign, we're relying on good will on the part of those who are signatories to those efforts. That's the nature of international relations.

Iran/Nuclear Nonproliferation Efforts
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said today that pressure and sanctions--speaking of Iran's nuclear program--pressure and sanctions cannot fundamentally solve the problem. I was wondering if you could clarify exactly what you believe President Hu Jintao has agreed to, whether you think there actually will be economic sanctions with teeth that the Chinese will sign off on, and what you have told the Chinese in terms of their concern about how much fuel they get from Iran, what the U.S. can help them with in that regard. Thank you, sir.
The President. Here's what I know. The Chinese have sent official representatives to negotiations in New York to begin the process of drafting a sanctions resolution. That is part of the P-5-plus-1 effort. And the United States is not moving this process alone. We've got the participation of the Russians as well as the other members of the P-5-plus-1, all of whom believe that it is important for us to send a strong signal to Iran that their consistent violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions as well as their obligations under the NPT have consequences and that they've got a better path to take.
Now, you're exactly right, Jake, that the Chinese are obviously concerned about what ramifications this might have on the economy generally. Iran is an oil-producing state. I think that a lot of countries around the world have trade relationships with Iran. And we're mindful of that. But what I said to President Hu and what I've said to every world leader that I talk to is that words have to mean something. There have to be some consequences. And if we are saying that the NPT is important, if we're saying that nonproliferation is important, then when those obligations are repeatedly flouted, then it's important for the international community to come together.
And what I would say is that if you consider where we were, say, a year ago with respect to the prospect of sanctions, the fact that we've got Russia and China as well as the other P-5-plus-1 members having a serious discussion around a sanctions regime, following up on a serious sanctions regime that was passed when North Korea flouted its obligations towards the NPT, it's a sign of the degree to which international diplomacy is making it more possible for us to isolate those countries that are breaking their international obligations.
And as I said, I think, several weeks ago, my interest is not having a long, drawn-out process for months. I want to see us move forward boldly and quickly to send the kind of message that will allow Iran to make a different calculation.
And keep in mind, I have said repeatedly that under the NPT, Iran has the right to develop peaceful civilian nuclear energy, as do all signatories to the NPT. The--but given the repeated violations that we've seen on the part of Iran, I think, understandably, the world community questions their commitment towards a peaceful civilian energy program.
They have a way of restoring that trust. For example, we put before them--I'm saying the P-5-plus-1, now, as well as the IAEA--put before them a very reasonable approach that would have allowed them to continue their civilian peaceful nuclear energy needs, but would have allayed many of the concerns around their nuclear weapons program. They have rejected that so far. And that's why it's important--and I said from the start that we're going to move on a dual track, and part of that dual track is making sure that a sanctions regime is in place.
Last point I'll make about sanctions. Sometimes I hear the argument that, well, sanctions aren't really going to necessarily work. Sanctions aren't a magic wand. What sanctions do accomplish is, hopefully, to change the calculus of a country like Iran so that they see that there are more costs and fewer benefits to pursuing a nuclear weapons program. And in that process, what we hope is, is that if those costs get high enough and the benefits are low enough, that in time, they make the right decision, not just for the security and prosperity of the world, but also for their own people.

Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons/Israel
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You have spoken often about the need to bring U.S. policy in line with its treaty obligations internationally to eliminate the perception of hypocrisy that some of the world sees toward the United States----
The President. Right.
Q. ----and its allies. In that spirit and in that venue, will you call on Israel to declare its nuclear program and sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty? And if not, why wouldn't other countries see that as an incentive not to sign on to the treaty that you say is important to strengthen?
The President. Well, Scott, initially, you were talking about U.S. behavior, and then suddenly, we were talking about Israel. Let me talk about the United States. I do think that as part of the NPT, our obligation as the largest nuclear power in the world is to take steps to reducing our nuclear stockpile. And that's what the START Treaty was about, sending a message that we are going to meet our obligations.
And as far as Israel goes, I'm not going to comment on their program. What I'm going to point to is the fact that consistently we have urged all countries to become members of the NPT.
So there's no contradiction there. We think it is important that we have a international approach that is universal and that rests on three pillars: that those of us who have nuclear weapons are making serious efforts to reduce those stockpiles; that we all are working against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and those countries that don't currently have nuclear weapons make the decision not to pursue nuclear weapons; and that all countries have access to peaceful nuclear energy.
And so whether we're talking about Israel or any other country, we think that becoming part of the NPT is important. And that, by the way, is not a new position. That's been a consistent position of the United States Government even prior to my administration.
Let me call on Stephen Collinson of AFP [Agence France-Presse].
China-U.S. Relations/Chinese Economy
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. In your meeting with President Hu, did he give you any indication he would heed your call for a more market-oriented exchange rate for the yuan? If there's going to be a change, when would you envisage that taking place? And what happened in the last few weeks to help you move on from a period of--quite a stormy period of public disagreements with China?
The President. The fact is, actually, that the relationship between my administration and the Chinese Government has been very productive during the course of the last year and a half. We started off working together at various multilateral fora, the first one in London with the G-20. I then, out of the bilateral meetings that we had, worked with President Hu to set up a Strategic and Economic Dialogue that looks at a whole range of areas in which the United States and China can cooperate. I made a visit to China that both of us considered very successful.
Now, there are some areas where we've got disagreement. And those disagreements are not new, and I have to say that the amount of turbulence, as you put it, that occurred was actually relatively modest when you look at the overall trajectory of U.S.-China relations. I mean, at no point was there ever a suggestion that it's not in the interests of both our countries to cooperate, and that we have not only important bilateral business to do, but also, we are two very important countries in multilateral settings that have to deal with issues like climate change and the world economy in concert.
With respect to the currency issue, President Hu and I have had a number of frank conversations. As part of the G-20 process, we all signed on to the notion that a rebalancing of the world economy would be important for sustained economic growth and the prevention of future crises. And China, like the United States, agreed to that framework.
We believe that part of that rebalancing involves making sure that currencies are tracking, roughly, the market and not giving any one country an advantage over the other. And I've been very clear of the fact that it is my estimation that the RMB is undervalued and that China's own decision in previous years to begin to move towards a more market-oriented approach is the right one. And I communicated that once again to President Hu. I think China rightly sees the issue of currency as a sovereign issue. I think they are resistant to international pressure when it comes to them making decisions about their currency policy and monetary policy.
But it is my belief that it is actually in China's interest to achieve this rebalancing, because over time, China is going to have to shift away from an economy that is solely oriented on exports and is going to have to start shifting towards an economy that is emphasizing domestic consumption and production and is preventing bubbles from building up within the economy. And all of that will be facilitated with a more market-oriented currency approach.
So I don't have a timetable, but it is my hope that China will make a decision that ultimately will be in their best interest.

North Korea
Q. Mr. President, a few minutes ago, when you were explaining the purpose of sanctions against Iran, you said the point is to change Iranian Government calculations, leading to altered behavior. Why hasn't that happened in the case of North Korea, which, unlike Iran, actually does have nuclear weapons?
The President. Well, I'm not going to give you a full dissertation on North Korean behavior. I think it's fair to say that North Korea has chosen a path of severe isolation that has been extraordinarily damaging to its people and that it is our hope that as pressure builds for North Korea to improve its economic performance, for example, to break out of that isolation, that we'll see a return to the six-party talks and that we will see a change in behavior.
Now, as I said, I--sanctions are not a magic wand. Unfortunately, nothing in international relations is. But I do think that the approach that we've taken with respect to North Korea makes it more likely for them to alter their behavior than had there been no consequences whatsoever to them testing a nuclear weapon. Okay?
Chuck Todd [NBC News].
Pakistan
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Given the goals of this conference and the goals of your administration on nuclear policy, why does it appear as if Pakistan is playing by a different set of rules? I know they have not signed on to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. But it appears they're expanding their nuclear program, and the proximity to Al Qaida--should there be more pressure internationally on Pakistan, not just coming from the United States, but the world?
The President. I don't think Pakistan's playing by a different set of rules. I think we've been very clear to Pakistan, as we have been to every country, that we think they should join the NPT. I have actually seen progress over the last several years with respect to Pakistan's nuclear security issues.
I want to lower tensions throughout South Asia when it comes to nuclear programs. And I think that the fact that President Gilani came here, signed on to a communique, and made a range of commitments that will make it more likely that we don't see proliferation activities or trafficking occurring out of Pakistan is a positive thing.
Do we have a lot of more work to do? Absolutely. But I think that President--or Prime Minister Gilani's presence here was an important step in assuring that we do not see a nuclear crisis anywhere in South Asia. Okay?
All right, Jeff Mason [Reuters].
Pakistan's Nuclear Security Program/Sanctions Against Iran
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. A follow-up question on two that have been asked: First, how realistic do you believe it is that countries will agree on sanctions in the coming weeks, which is the deadline that you're looking for? And a second, a follow-up on Pakistan: Is the United States confident that Pakistan's nuclear materials are protected and will not be vulnerable to terrorists like Al Qaida?
The President. Yes. To take the second question first, just as a part of a follow-up on Chuck's question, I feel confident about Pakistan's security around its nuclear weapons programs. But that doesn't mean that there isn't improvement to make in all of our nuclear security programs. I mean, you'll recall that we had a little incident a while back where we had nuclear-tipped missiles on a bomber flying across the United States, and nobody knew about it. And Secretary Gates took exactly the right step, which was to hold those in charge accountable and to significantly alter our practices to make sure something like that didn't happen again.
So I think it's important to note that every nuclear power, every country that has a civilian nuclear energy program has to take better steps to secure these materials. And Pakistan is not exempt from that, but we aren't either. And that's, I think, the goal of this summit, and that was the goal of the communique and the work plan that we've put forward.
With respect to sanctions, I think that we have a strong number of countries on the Security Council who believe this is the right thing to do. But I think these negotiations can be difficult. And I am going to push as hard as I can to make sure that we get strong sanctions that have consequences for Iran as it's making calculations about its nuclear program and that those are done on a timely basis. I'm not going to speculate beyond that in terms of where we are.
Last question, Ed Chen of Bloomberg.
U.S. Foreign Policy/Middle East Peace Process
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Good afternoon. Given the progress you have cited in recent days on your foreign policy agenda, to what extent do you feel like you have gained political capital with which to take further to the international stage for the rest of this year to perhaps rejuvenate some initiatives in trouble spots such as the Middle East and elsewhere?
The President. Well, I think the work that we've done in recent days around nuclear security and nuclear disarmament are intrinsically good. They're good just in and of themselves. And so we're very pleased with the progress that we've made. And we could not have done this without extraordinary cooperation first from President Medvedev, when it came to the START Treaty, and then from my colleagues who were here today, when it came to this nuclear security summit.
What I think it signifies is the fact that so many of the challenges that we face internationally can't be solved by one nation alone. But I do think that America's leadership is important in order to get issues on the international agenda and to move in concert with other countries to have an effective response.
There are a host of other issues, obviously, that have to be addressed. And one of the points that was made, actually, during the communique is we're talking here about the instruments of potential war or terrorism, but obviously there are also the reasons, the rationales, the excuses for conflict that have to be addressed as well.
And I remain committed to being a partner with countries around the world, and in particular hot spots around the world, to see if we can reduce those tensions and ultimately resolve those conflicts. And the Middle East would be a prime example. I think that the need for peace between Israelis and Palestinians and the Arab States remains as critical as ever.
It is a very hard thing to do. And I know that even if we are applying all of our political capital to that issue, the Israeli people, through their Government, and the Palestinian people, through the Palestinian Authority, as well as other Arab States may say to themselves, we are not prepared to resolve this--these issues no matter how much pressure the United States brings to bear.
And the truth is, in some of these conflicts, the United States can't impose solutions unless the participants in these conflicts are willing to break out of old patterns of antagonism. I think it was former Secretary of State Jim Baker who said, in the context of Middle East peace, ""We can't want it more than they do.""
But what we can make sure of is, is that we are constantly present, constantly engaged, and setting out very clearly to both sides our belief that not only is it in the interests of each party to resolve these conflicts, but it's also in the interest of the United States. It is a vital national security interest of the United States to reduce these conflicts, because whether we like it or not, we remain a dominant military superpower, and when conflicts break out, one way or another, we get pulled into them. And that ends up costing us significantly in terms of both blood and treasure.
So I'm going to keep on at it. But I think on all these issues--nuclear disarmament, nuclear proliferation, Middle East peace--progress is going to be measured not in days, not in weeks. It's going to take time. And progress will be halting. And sometimes we'll take one step forward and two steps back, and there will be frustrations. And so it's not going to run on the typical cable news 24/7 news cycle, but if we're persistent and we've got the right approach, then over time, I think that we can make progress.
All right? Thank you very much, everybody."

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/287989",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-felipe-de-jesus-calderon-hinojosa-mexico-0,"President Obama. Good afternoon. Buenas tardes. I want to again welcome President Calderon to the White House. And Michelle and I are delighted to be hosting the President and First Lady Margarita Zavala and their delegation for this state visit, and we're looking forward to returning the hospitality--the wonderful hospitality that we received in Mexico when we have our state dinner this evening.
I've often said that in our interconnected world, where nations and peoples are linked like never before, both the promise and perils of our time are shared. Nowhere is this clearer than among the neighbors the United States and Mexico.
The trade and tourism between us creates jobs and prosperity for both our peoples. When a flu spreads, or an earthquake strikes, or cartels threaten innocent people, it affects lives on both sides of our common border. When our neighbors are in need, whether in Honduras or in Haiti, we respond together. And when we expand partnerships between our people, it forges connections that leads to greater prosperity and opportunity for decades to come.
In pursuit of our shared future, I have a true partner in President Calderon. We've worked together in Mexico City and Guadalajara, in Washington and Pittsburgh, in London and L'Aquila. And when he speaks before a joint session of Congress tomorrow, I believe the American people will see what I see: They'll see a leader who is guiding his country through very difficult times with vision and with courage, and he has been an outstanding partner to me and an outstanding partner to the United States.
Indeed, our progress today marks another step forward in a new era of cooperation and partnership between our countries, a partnership based on mutual interests, mutual respect, and mutual responsibility.
We agreed to continue working aggressively on our highest economic priority, which is creating jobs for our people. Mexico is one of our largest trading partners, with trade that supports countless jobs here in America and in Mexico. And because 80 percent of the trade passes over our land border, we reaffirmed our commitment to a 21st-century border that is modern, secure, and efficient. And we're directing our Governments to develop an action plan to move in this direction, because our shared border must be an engine, and not a brake, on our economic growth.
To create jobs and increase our competitiveness in the global economy, we agreed to streamline regulations and strengthen the protection of intellectual property. We agreed to continue working with our G-20 partners to encourage that global economic growth is balanced and sustained, especially as we approach next month's Toronto summit. And as the United States works to increase our exports and the jobs that come with it, we'll be working closely with our partners in Mexico, which is one of the largest markets for American exports.
To create clean energy jobs and industries of the future, we're building on a partnership we launched last year with new initiatives to promote regional renewable energy markets, green buildings, and smart grid technology. These initiatives will also help us implement the commitments we made at Copenhagen, especially as we work toward the climate conference in Cancun later this year. And let me say that, as a leader in cutting greenhouse gas emissions and in helping developing countries do the same, Mexico's leadership under President Calderon has been and will be critical.
For the sake of our shared prosperity and security, we discussed the need for immigration that is orderly and safe, and we acknowledged that both our countries have responsibilities. President Calderon is working hard to create jobs so that more Mexicans see a future of opportunity in their country.
To fix our broken immigration system, I reaffirmed my deep commitment to working with Congress in a bipartisan way to pass comprehensive immigration reform. And comprehensive reform means accountability for everybody: Government that is accountable for securing the border, businesses being held accountable when they exploit workers, people who break the law by breaching our borders being held accountable by paying taxes and a penalty and getting right with the law before they can earn their citizenship. We've been working hard to get this done. There's a strong proposal in the Senate, based on a bipartisan framework, and it can and should move forward.
Now, we also discussed the new law in Arizona, which is a misdirected effort, a misdirected expression of frustration over our broken immigration system, and which has raised concerns in both our countries. Today I want every American to know my administration has devoted unprecedented resources in personnel and technology to securing our border. Illegal immigration is down, not up, and we will continue to do what's necessary to secure our shared border.
And I want everyone, American and Mexican, to know my administration is taking a very close look at the Arizona law. We're examining any implications, especially for civil rights, because in the United States of America, no law-abiding person--be they an American citizen, a legal immigrant, or a visitor or tourist from Mexico--should ever be subject to suspicion simply because of what they look like.
President Calderon and I also reaffirmed our commitment to stand together against the drug cartels that have unleashed horrific violence in so many communities. Mr. President, you and the Mexican people have shown great resolve in a fight for the security and safety of your country. And as I've pledged to you before, Mexico can count on the United States as a full partner in this effort.
As your partner, we'll give you the support you need to prevail. Through increased law enforcement on our side of the border, we're putting unprecedented pressure on those who traffic in drugs, guns, and people. We're working to stem the southbound flow of American guns and money, which is why, for the first time, we are now screening 100 percent of southbound rail cargo. And guided by our new National Drug Control Strategy, we're bringing new approaches to reducing the demand for drugs in our country.
As regional partners, the President and I discussed the situation in Honduras and the need for continued cooperation to support the people of Haiti as they recover and they rebuild. And as global partners, and given Mexico's seat on the U.N. Security Council, we agreed on the need for Iran to uphold its international obligations or face increased sanctions and pressure, including U.N. sanctions. And I'm pleased that we've reached an agreement with our P-5-plus-1 partners on a strong resolution that we now have shared with our Security Council partners.
Finally, I'm proud that we're expanding exchanges between our college and university students and launching a new exchange program for our high school students. I'd note that it was a Mexican student at an American university who went on to become the President who stands next to me today. And with these exchanges we'll bring together the next generation of American and Mexican leaders.
This is the progress that we've made today. It's progress that calls to mind a Mexican proverb that I am told says, ""Tell me who you walk with, and I will tell you who you are."" Mr. President, the United States is proud to walk with Mexico. And through our work, we're reminded again of who we are, which is two neighbors, two partners bound by a common vision of prosperity and security for both our people.
President Calderon.
President Calderon. Thank you, President.
Ladies and gentlemen, members of the media, good afternoon. First of all, I would like to thank the kind invitation of the people and the Government of the United States to carry out this visit. And I am the bearer of a respectful and affectionate greeting of the Mexican people to this Nation, which is our neighbor and friend. I would like to thank the words and the hospitality of President Barack Obama.
The United States and Mexico are nations that trade, dialogue, and complement each other economically and mutually. We are nations that have a political understanding of the highest level. And we are also countries with a fruitful dynamic and ties between people, communities, public and private institutions throughout 3,000 kilometers of border. Our relationship is characterized by an honest and open dialogue based on trust, respect, and coresponsibility.
As it has been stated by President Obama, this morning we held a broad and fruitful dialogue. We've reviewed our bilateral relationships: the problems, the challenges, and also the many opportunities that we face. We analyzed different proposals and visions on the side of Mexico and the United States to strengthen North America as a region.
We talked about the relevance of solving our differences and trade problems in the fastest possible way. We covered the border topics, such as security, migration, and we also examined initiatives to consolidate our cooperation in global scenarios and global interests.
I can highlight here that the areas where we agree are broader than our differences. There's a broad convergence of interest. And this is not only given to the fact that we share common goals, but there is a will in both of us to turn the fact of being neighbors into a partnership that will act as a leveler for shared development.
Fortunately, the serious economic global crisis is giving up. This opens up a window of opportunity for Canada, the United States, and Mexico to reposition Mexico and North America as a vigorous region, competitive and prosperous, capable of generating more and better jobs, a region that will be attractive for investments, trade exchange, and tourism, with great perspectives facing the future.
Together, we should increase our exporting capacity in a contest of growing competitiveness among different regions of the world. We talked about the different obstacles that are there for complying with transportation obligations that have been established at NAFTA, a situation that impacts jobs, companies, and consumers in Mexico and in the United States. And we shall work in order to achieve a quick solution, with a constructive, creative solution in the long term, in this and many other areas.
As the President has stated, we gave special attention to the border matters. The border is not only a place of encounter for both our nations, but it's also an area of opportunity for our aspirations that we share regarding development. For this we will allocate more resources for the border infrastructure in order that it will be at the height of the needs of our economies and communities, and that it will benefit both sides of the border. We will strengthen the coordination among the government officials on both sides of the border to reinforce security.
We want to make this quite clear: We, both countries, want to have a safe border, a safe border for our people. We agreed upon the urgency of reinforce the actions to stop the flow of drugs, weapons, and cash. And for this we will work with full abidance to the legislations and jurisdictions of each country in a coresponsible way.
In reference to the migratory issue, I acknowledge the sensitivity and the commitment of President Obama to look for a comprehensive solution that will be respectful of the rights of the individuals and will be adjusting itself in a realistic way to the needs of both our economies. We talked openly about this and other issues.
We identified that the economies of our countries are clearly complementing each other, and when we--integrating them, they are a powerful tool to bring productivity and competitiveness up within the whole region. Greater competitiveness in North America means more jobs and better living conditions for the people of the United States and for the people of Mexico.
In Mexico, we are and will continue being respectful of the internal policies of the United States and its legitimate right to establish, in accordance to its Constitution, whatever laws it approves. But we will retain our firm rejection to criminalize migration so that people that work and provide things to this Nation will be treated as criminals. And we oppose firmly the S.B. 1070 Arizona law given in fair principles that are partial and discriminatory.
This and other issues were covered during this meeting, which I will dare to say that it's historic given the level of understanding and trust that we have reached.
For the meantime, I would just like to highlight this open and honest and constructive dialogue that we keep and hold with the President of--with the Government of President Obama and these two countries that allows me to see the strength and leadership of the President of the United States.
Thank you, President Obama, for your hospitality. I want to thank all of you for your kind attention.
President Obama. Okay, we've got time for one question each. I'm going to call on Lourdes [Lourdes Meluza] from Univision.
Q. [inaudible]
President Obama. Why don't you wait for the microphone so we can hear you.
Arizona's Illegal Immigration Enforcement Legislation/Immigration Reform/U.S. Border Security
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. President Calderon called again the Arizona law discriminatory; you have called it misdirected. Do you agree with him? What impact do you think that this law could have on the U.S.-Mexico relations, the prospect for immigration reform, and the lives of millions of Mexican Americans in this country? And what actions did you tell President Calderon that you would follow in the following days and weeks.
President Obama. I think the Arizona law has the potential of being applied in a discriminatory fashion. Now, after it was initially passed, the Arizona legislature amended it and said that this should not be carried out in a discriminatory way. But I think a fair reading of the language of the statute indicates that it gives the possibility of individuals who are deemed suspicious of being illegal immigrants from being harassed or arrested. And the judgments that are going to be made in applying this law are troublesome.
Now, what I've directed my Justice Department to do is to look very carefully at the language of this law to see whether it comports both with our core values and existing legal standards, as well as the fact that the Federal Government is ultimately the one charged with immigration policy. And I expect to get a final report back from the Justice Department soon, at which point we'll make some decisions in terms of how we are going to address that law.
Now, what I've also said, though, is that the Arizona law, I think, expresses some of the frustrations that the American people have had in not fixing a broken immigration system and, frankly, the failures of the Federal Government to get this done. I'm sympathetic to those frustrations. I share those frustrations, which is why, from the time that I was a U.S. Senator through the time that I ran for President, until now, I have consistently said that I'm supportive of a comprehensive immigration reform approach.
And I think the majority of American people are open to a comprehensive immigration reform approach, which would say the following things: Number one, that the Federal Government takes its responsibilities for securing our border seriously. And as I just stated in my opening remarks, we have actually put more resources, more personnel on the borders, and illegal immigration is actually down on the borders, not up. I know that's not the perception out there, but that's the fact.
But we haven't done enough. So we've got a responsibility to create an orderly border, and that's something that we have to do not unilaterally, but also working with the Mexican Government, because there are enormous flows of trade and tourists and people along the border region. The economies are interdependent, and we've got to control the borders, but do so in a way that does not have an adverse impact on the economies of those regions.
The second thing we've got to do is we've got to make sure that businesses are following the rules and are not actively recruiting undocumented workers so that they don't have to abide by overtime laws, they don't have to abide by minimum wage laws, they don't have to abide by worker safety laws and otherwise undercut basic worker protections that exist. And they have to be held accountable and responsible.
The third thing we have to do is to make sure that those who have come to this country illegally are held accountable. And that means they need to pay a fine, they need to pay back taxes. I believe they should learn English. I believe that it is important for them to get to the back of the line and not in the front, but that we create a pathway so that they have an opportunity, if they are following the rules, following the law, to become legal residents and ultimately citizens of this country.
Now, that kind of package in which everybody has responsibilities I think is one that can pass. And it is one that I am fully supportive of. And I've said this again and again. And I think if we get that done, then you will be less likely to see the kinds of measures that we saw in Arizona.
Here's the challenge that we have politically. The political challenge is, is that I have confidence that I can get the majority of Democrats, both in the House and the Senate, to support a piece of legislation of the sort that I just described. But I don't have 60 votes in the Senate. I've got to have some support from Republicans. When we made an effort of this sort a few years ago, it was under the leadership of John McCain and Ted Kennedy. And because there was a bipartisan effort, we were actually able to generate a majority of votes in the Senate. And we just missed being able to get it done in the House.
If we can recreate that atmosphere--I don't expect to get every Republican vote, but I need some help in order to get it done. And there have been people who have expressed an interest. But if they're willing to come forward and get a working group and get this moving, I'm actually confident that we can get it done. And the American people, including the people of Arizona, are going to prefer that the Federal Government takes responsibility and does what it's supposed to do.
And it's my job to work with Members of Congress to see that happen. And it's also my job to work with the Mexican Government to make sure that it happens, because President Calderon recognizes that he has responsibilities on his side of the border as well.
And the last point I'll make on this topic is this: I think all of us recognize that some of the pressures with respect to immigration just arise out of economics. People in Mexico are looking for opportunity, and they feel that they can make more money here in the United States. What we also have to recognize--and I talked about this with President Calderon--is every nation also has the right to secure its borders and make orderly decisions about who comes in and who comes out.
And the key here is for us to keep both principles in mind, that people want to find a better life where they can, and if they have opportunity in America, they're going to want to come here. We can't just try to use force to prevent that. On the other hand, the United States has to be able to make determinations about who comes in and who comes out in an orderly fashion. And if we are both a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants, then I think we will not only be true to our core values, but we're also going to be creating a more prosperous future for everybody.
Okay.
President Calderon. Radio Formula. Israel has a question.
U.S. Border Security/Mexico-U.S. Drug Control Cooperation
Q. President Obama, there's several issues, but not to detour from this same topic, I would like to know if you have already a strategy planned in regards to the Arizona law, because it is violating the fundamental rights of people. How are you going to turn around this trend, President Obama, that is being shown in different States of the United States against migrants--this migratory reform that you're talking about, to know when it will be taken to Congress and what's the scope that it will have?
The second area regarding security, President Obama, I would like to know, how do you value the battle against organized crime that President Calderon is having? Has this been a success? What is it missing? And following this issue, to know if you have seen that the weapons that illegally cross from the United States to Mexico are the ones that are used by the organized crime people in Mexico? Shouldn't there be an initiative that will regulate guns as they are sold? Is there going to be a ban?
President Obama. [inaudible]--a pretty comprehensive answer earlier, so I'm just going to take your second question, and that is the issue of security. This is obviously a shared concern and is going to require shared effort on the part of both of our nations. I said the first time I met President Calderon and have said ever since that I greatly admire his courage, his dedication, his tenacity in trying to deal with the drug traffickers and cartels that have created such a public safety crisis in many communities within Mexico.
As we pointed out, this is not just an issue of the drug trade, this is an issue of how is it affecting people's day-to-day lives within Mexico. And the Mexican people have an interest in dealing with this. And he has stood up consistently because he recognizes that his foremost job, his most important task as President is to keep the Mexican people safe.
So we are fully supportive of the efforts that he's been making. We have had extensive collaboration over the last several years in making sure that, in a way that respects Mexico's sovereignty, we are responsive to whatever requests are made by the Calderon administration. To the extent that we can help through the Merida Initiative--provide equipment, provide training, provide technologies that can help in these efforts--we have done so. And we will continue to coordinate as effectively as we can with the Calderon administration to make sure that we deal with this problem.
Now, as you point out, this is not just a problem in Mexico. It is a problem that the United States has to address. And the two things that we have to address--and I said this when I was in Mexico, and I will repeat here--it is absolutely true that U.S. demand for drugs helps to drive this public safety crisis within Mexico. And so we've got an obligation not to drive the demand side of the equation. And so most recently we've put forward our new strategy that emphasizes not just enforcement, but also prevention, also treatment so that we can drive down demand and weaken the grip that these drug cartels have.
The second aspect of this that we have to deal with is the southbound flows from the United States of both weapons and cash that helps to empower these drug cartels. And so what I've directed my Department of Homeland Security, ATF, all our various agencies that have responsibilities in these areas to do is to ramp up our efforts at interdicting these southern flows.
And I already mentioned to you, for example, we've now instituted a policy where we are searching 100 percent of rail cargo that's going south. That is a significant investment of law enforcement resources on our part, but it's the right thing to do. We want to crack down on illegal gun dealers who are selling weapons into Mexico. All those are steps that we are doing in coordination with the Calderon Government. And we will continue to emphasize the importance not only to Mexico, but also the United States of tackling this problem.
Okay. Thank you very much, everybody."
"May 27, 2010",The President's News Conference,Barack Obama,"Barack Obama, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/288158",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1118,"The President. Good afternoon, everybody. Before I take your questions, I want to update the American people on the status of the BP oil spill, a catastrophe that is causing tremendous hardship in the Gulf Coast, damaging a precious ecosystem, and one that led to the death of 11 workers who lost their lives in the initial explosion.
Yesterday the Federal Government gave BP approval to move forward with a procedure known as a top kill to try to stop the leak. This involves plugging the well with densely packed mud to prevent any more oil from escaping. And given the complexity of this procedure and the depth of the leak, this procedure offers no guarantee of success. But we're exploring any reasonable strategies to try and save the Gulf from a spill that may otherwise last until the relief wells are finished, and that's a process that could take months.
The American people should know that from the moment this disaster began, the Federal Government has been in charge of the response effort. As far as I'm concerned, BP is responsible for this horrific disaster, and we will hold them fully accountable on behalf of the United States as well as the people and communities victimized by this tragedy. We will demand that they pay every dime they owe for the damage they've done and the painful losses that they've caused. And we will continue to take full advantage of the unique technology and expertise they have to help stop this leak.
But make no mistake: BP is operating at our direction. Every key decision and action they take must be approved by us in advance. I've designated Admiral Thad Allen, who has nearly four decades of experience responding to such disasters, as the national incident commander, and if he orders BP to do something to respond to this disaster, they are legally bound to do it. So, for example, when they said they would drill one relief well to stem this leak, we demanded a backup and ordered them to drill two. And they are in the process of drilling two.
As we devise strategies to try and stop this leak, we're also relying on the brightest minds and most advanced technology in the world. We're relying on a team of scientists and engineers from our own national laboratories and from many other nations, a team led by our Energy Secretary and Nobel Prize-winning physicist, Steven Chu. And we're relying on experts who've actually dealt with oil spills from across the globe, though none this challenging.
The Federal Government is also directing the effort to contain and clean up the damage from the spill, which is now the largest effort of its kind in U.S. history. In this case, the Federal, State, and local governments have the resources and expertise to play an even more direct role in the response effort. And I will be discussing this further when I make my second trip to Louisiana tomorrow. But so far, we have about 20,000 people in the region who are working around the clock to contain and clean up this oil. We have activated about 1,400 members of the National Guard in 4 States. We have the Coast Guard onsite. We have more than 1,300 vessels assisting in the containment and cleanup efforts. We've deployed over 3 million feet of total boom to stop the oil from coming onshore, and today more than 100,000 feet of boom is being surged to Louisiana parishes that are facing the greatest risk from the oil.
So we'll continue to do whatever is necessary to protect and restore the Gulf Coast. For example, Admiral Allen just announced that we're moving forward with a section of Governor Jindal's barrier island proposal that could help stop oil from coming ashore. It will be built in an area that is most at risk and where the work can be most quickly completed.
We're also doing whatever it takes to help the men and women whose livelihoods have been disrupted and even destroyed by this spill, everyone from fishermen to restaurant and hotel owners. So far, the Small Business Administration has approved loans and allowed many small businesses to defer existing loan payments. At our insistence, BP is paying economic injury claims, and we'll make sure that when all is said and done, the victims of this disaster will get the relief that they are owed. We're not going to abandon our fellow citizens. We'll help them recover, and we will help them rebuild.
And in the meantime, I should also say that Americans can help by continuing to visit the communities and beaches of the Gulf Coast. I was talking to the Governors just a couple of days ago, and they wanted me to remind everybody that except for three beaches in Louisiana, all of the Gulf's beaches are open, they are safe, and they are clean.
Now, as we continue our response effort, we're also moving quickly on steps to ensure that a catastrophe like this never happens again. I've said before that producing oil here in America is an essential part of our overall energy strategy. But all drilling must be safe.
In recent months, I've spoken about the dangers of too much--I've heard people speaking about the dangers of too much Government regulation. And I think we can all acknowledge there have been times in history when the Government has overreached. But in this instance, the oil industry's cozy and sometimes corrupt relationship with Government regulators meant little or no regulation at all.
When Secretary Salazar took office, he found a Minerals and Management Service that had been plagued by corruption for years. This was the agency charged with not only providing permits, but also enforcing laws governing oil drilling. And the corruption was underscored by a recent Inspector General's report that covered activity which occurred prior to 2007, a report that can only be described as appalling. And Secretary Salazar immediately took steps to clean up that corruption. But this oil spill has made clear that more reforms are needed.
For years, there's been a scandalously close relationship between oil companies and the agency that regulates them. That's why we've decided to separate the people who permit the drilling from those who regulate and ensure the safety of the drilling.
I also announced that no new permits for drilling new wells will go forward until a 30-day safety and environmental review was conducted. That review is now complete. Its initial recommendations include aggressive new operating standards and requirements for offshore energy companies, which we will put in place.
Additionally, after reading the report's recommendations with Secretary Salazar and other members of my administration, we're going to be ordering the following actions: First, we will suspend the planned exploration of two locations off the coast of Alaska; second, we will cancel the pending lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico and the proposed lease sale off the coast of Virginia; third, we will continue the existing moratorium and suspend the issuance of new permits to drill new deepwater wells for 6 months; and four, we will suspend action on 33 deepwater exploratory wells currently being drilled in the Gulf of Mexico.
What's also been made clear from this disaster is that for years, the oil and gas industry has leveraged such power that they have effectively been allowed to regulate themselves. One example: Under current law, the Interior Department has only 30 days to review an exploration plan submitted by an oil company. That leaves no time for the appropriate environmental review. The result is, they are continually waived. And this is just one example of a law that was tailored by the industry to serve their needs instead of the public's. So Congress needs to address these issues as soon as possible, and my administration will work with them to do so.
Still, preventing such a catastrophe in the future will require further study and deeper reform. That's why last Friday, I also signed an Executive order establishing the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. While there are a number of ongoing investigations, including an independent review by the National Academy of Engineering, the purpose of this Commission is to consider both the root causes of the disaster and offer options on what safety and environmental precautions are necessary.
If the laws on our books are inadequate to prevent such a spill, or if we did not enforce those laws, then I want to know. I want to know what worked and what didn't work in our response to the disaster and where oversight of the oil and gas industry broke down.
Let me make one final point. More than anything else, this economic and environmental tragedy--and it's a tragedy--underscores the urgent need for this Nation to develop clean, renewable sources of energy. Doing so will not only reduce threats to our environment, it will create a new, homegrown American industry that can lead to countless new businesses and new jobs.
We've talked about doing this for decades, and we've made significant strides over the last year when it comes to investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency. The House of Representatives has already passed a bill that would finally jump-start a permanent transition to a clean energy economy, and there is currently a plan in the Senate--a plan that was developed with ideas from Democrats and Republicans--that would achieve the same goal.
If nothing else, this disaster should serve as a wake-up call that it's time to move forward on this legislation. It's time to accelerate the competition with countries like China, who've already realized the future lies in renewable energy. And it's time to seize that future ourselves. So I call on Democrats and Republicans in Congress, working with my administration, to answer this challenge once and for all.
I'll close by saying this: This oil spill is an unprecedented disaster. The fact that the source of the leak is a mile under the surface, where no human being can go, has made it enormously difficult to stop. But we are relying on every resource and every idea, every expert and every bit of technology to work to stop it. We will take ideas from anywhere, but we are going to stop it.
And I know that doesn't lessen the enormous sense of anger and frustration felt by people on the Gulf and so many Americans. Every day I see this leak continue, I am angry and frustrated as well. I realize that this entire response effort will continue to be filtered through the typical prism of politics, but that's not what I care about right now. What I care about right now is the containment of this disaster and the health and safety and livelihoods of our neighbors in the Gulf Coast. And for as long as it takes, I intend to use the full force of the Federal Government to protect our fellow citizens and the place where they live. I can assure you of that.
All right. I'm going to take some questions. I'm going to start with Jennifer Loven [Associated Press].
Federal Oversight of Oil Spill Response
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. This is on, right?
The President. Yes.
Q. You just said that the Federal Government is in charge, and officials in your administration have said this repeatedly. Yet how do you explain that we're more than 5 weeks into this crisis and that BP is not always doing as you're asking, for example, with the type of dispersant that's being used?
And if I might add one more, to the many people in the Gulf who, as you said, are angry and frustrated and feel somewhat abandoned, what do you say about whether your personal involvement, your personal engagement, has been as much as it should be, either privately or publicly?
The President. Well, I'll take the second question first, if you don't mind. The day that the rig collapsed and fell to the bottom of the ocean, I had my team in the Oval Office that first day. Those who think that we were either slow on our response or lacked urgency don't know the facts. This has been our highest priority since this crisis occurred.
Personally, I'm briefed every day and have probably had more meetings on this issue than just about any issue since we did our Afghan review. And we understood from day one the potential enormity of this crisis and acted accordingly. So when it comes to the moment this crisis occurred, moving forward, this entire White House and this entire Federal Government has been singularly focused on how do we stop the leak and how do we prevent and mitigate the damage to our coastlines.
The challenge we have is that we have not seen a leak like this before, and so people are going to be frustrated until it stops. And I understand that. And if you're living on the coasts and you see this sludge coming at you, you are going to be continually upset, and from your perspective, the response is going to be continually inadequate until it actually stops. And that's entirely appropriate and understandable.
But from Thad Allen, our national incident coordinator, through the most junior member of the Coast Guard or the under-under-under secretary of NOAA or any of the agencies under my charge, they understand this is the single most important thing that we have to get right.
Now, with respect to the relationship between our Government and BP, the United States Government has always been in charge of making sure that the response is appropriate. BP, under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, is considered the responsible party, which basically means they've got to pay for everything that's done to both stop the leak and mitigate the damage. They do so under our supervision, and any major decision that they make has to be done under the approval of Thad Allen, the national incident coordinator.
So this notion that somehow the Federal Government is sitting on the sidelines and for the last 3 or 4 or 5 weeks we've just been letting BP make a whole bunch of decisions is simply not true.
What is true is that when it comes to stopping the leak down below, the Federal Government does not possess superior technology to BP. This is something, by the way--going back to my involvement--2 or 3 days after this happened, we had a meeting down in the Situation Room in which I specifically asked Bob Gates and Mike Mullen, what assets do we have that could potentially help that BP or other oil companies around the world do not have? We do not have superior technology when it comes to dealing with this particular crisis.
Now, one of the legitimate questions that I think needs to be asked is, should the Federal Government have such capacity? And that's part of what the role of the Commission is going to be, is to take a look and say, do we make sure that a consortium of oil companies pay for specific technology to deal with this kind of incident when it happens? Should that response team that's effective be under the direct charge of the United States Government or a private entity? But for now, BP has the best technology, along with the other oil companies, when it comes to actually capping the well down there.
Now, when it comes to what's happening on the surface, we've been much more involved in the in situ burns, in the skimming. Those have been happening more or less under our direction, and we feel comfortable about many of the steps that have been taken.
There have been areas where there have been disagreements, and I'll give you two examples. Initially on this top kill, there were questions in terms of how effective it could be, but also what were the risks involved, because we're operating at such a pressurized level, a mile underwater, and in such frigid temperatures that the reactions of various compounds and various approaches had to be calibrated very carefully. That's when I sent Steven Chu down, the Secretary of Energy, and he brought together a team, basically a brain trust, of some of the smartest folks we have at the national labs and in academia to essentially serve as a oversight board with BP engineers and scientists in making calculations about how much mud could you pour down, how fast, without risking, potentially, the whole thing blowing.
So in that situation, you've got the Federal Government directly overseeing what BP is doing, and Thad Allen is giving authorization when finally we feel comfortable that the risks of attempting a top kill, for example, are sufficiently reduced that it needs to be tried.
I already mentioned a second example, which is they wanted to drill one relief well. The experience has been that when you drill one relief well, potentially you keep on missing the mark. And so it's important to have two to maximize the speed and effectiveness of a relief well.
And right now Thad Allen is down there, because I think he--it's his view that some of the allocation of boom or other efforts to protect shorelines hasn't been as nimble as it needs to be. And he's said so publicly. And so he will be making sure that, in fact, the resources to protect the shorelines are there immediately.
But here's the broad point: There has never been a point during this crisis in which this administration, up and down the line, in all these agencies, hasn't, number one, understood this was my top priority--getting this stopped and then mitigating the damage; and number two, understanding that if BP wasn't doing what our best options were, we were fully empowered to instruct them--to tell them to do something different.
And so if you take a look at what's transpired over the last 4 to 5 weeks, there may be areas where there have been disagreements, for example, on dispersants, and these are complicated issues. But overall, the decisions that have been made have been reflective of the best science that we've got, the best expert opinion that we have, and have been weighing various risks and various options to allocate our resources in such a way that we can get this fixed as quickly as possible. Okay?
Jake Tapper [ABC News].
Federal Response to Oil Spill
Q. Thanks, Mr. President. You say that everything that could be done is being done, but there are those in the region and those industry experts who say that's not true. Governor Jindal obviously had this proposal for a barrier. They say that if that had been approved when they first asked for it, they would have 10 miles up already. There are fishermen down there who want to work, who want to help, haven't been trained, haven't been told to go do so. There are industry experts who say that they're surprised that tankers haven't been sent out there to vacuum, as was done in '93 outside Saudi Arabia. And then, of course, there's the fact that there are 17 countries that have offered to help, and it's only been accepted from two countries, Norway and Mexico. How can you say that everything that can be done is being done with all these experts and all these officials saying that's not true?
The President. Well, let me distinguish between--if the question is, Jake, are we doing everything perfectly out there, then the answer is absolutely not. We can always do better. If the question is, are we, each time there is an idea, evaluating it and making a decision, is this the best option that we have right now, based on how quickly we can stop this leak and how much damage can we mitigate, then the answer is yes.
So let's take the example of Governor Jindal's barrier islands idea. When I met with him when I was down there 2 weeks ago, I said, I will make sure that our team immediately reviews this idea, that the Army Corps of Engineers is looking at the feasibility of it, and if they think--if they tell me that this is the best approach to dealing with this problem, then we're going to move quickly to execute it. If they have a disagreement with Governor Jindal's experts as to whether this would be effective or not, whether it was going to be cost-effective, given the other things that need to be done, then we'll sit down and try to figure that out.
And that essentially is what's happened, which is why today you saw an announcement where, from the Army Corps' perspective, there were some areas where this might work, but there are some areas where it would be counterproductive and not a good use of resources.
So the point is, on each of these points that you just mentioned, the job of our response team is to say, okay, if 17 countries have offered equipment and help, let's evaluate what they've offered: How fast can it get here? Is it actually going to be redundant, or will it actually add to the overall effort? Because in some cases, more may not actually be better. And decisions have been made based on the best information available that says, here's what we need right now. It may be that a week from now or 2 weeks from now or a month from now, the offers from some of those countries might be more effectively utilized.
Now, it's going to be entirely possible in a operation this large that mistakes are made, judgments prove to be wrong, that people who say in retrospect, you know, if we could have done that or we did that, this might have turned out differently--although in a lot of cases, it may be speculation. But the point that I was addressing from Jennifer was, does this administration maintain a constant sense of urgency about this, and are we examining every recommendation, every idea is out there, and making our best judgment as to whether these are the right steps to take, based on the best experts that we know of? And on that answer, the answer is yes--or on that question, the answer is yes.
Chuck Todd [NBC News].
Federal Oversight of Oil Spill Response
Q. I just want to follow up on the question as it has to do with the relationship between the Government and BP. It seems that you've made the case on the technical issues. But onshore, Admiral Allen admitted the other day in a White House briefing that they needed to be pushed harder. Senator Mary Landrieu this morning said it's not clear who's in charge, that the Government should be in charge. Why not ask BP to simply step aside on the onshore stuff, make it an entirely Government thing? Obviously, BP pays for it, but why not ask them to just completely step aside on that front?
And then also, can you respond to all the Katrina comparisons that people are making about this with yourself?
The President. Well, the--I'll take your second question first. I'll leave it to you guys to make those comparisons and make judgments on it, because what I'm spending my time thinking about is how do we solve the problem. And when the problem is solved and people look back and do an assessment of all the various decisions that were made, I think people can make a historical judgment. And I'm confident that people are going to look back and say that this administration was on top of what was an unprecedented crisis.
In terms of shoreline protection, the way this thing has been set up under the oil spill act of 1990--Oil Pollution Act--is that BP has contracts with a whole bunch of contractors on file in the event that there is an oil spill, and as soon as the Deep Horizon well went down, then their job is to activate those and start paying them. So a big chunk of the 20,000 who are already down there are being paid by BP.
The Coast Guard's job is to approve and authorize whatever BP is doing. Now, what Admiral Allen said today, and the reason he's down there today, is that if BP's contractors are not moving as nimbly and effectively as they need to be, then it is already the power of the Federal Government to redirect those resources. I guess the point being that the Coast Guard and our military are potentially already in charge as long as we've got good information and we are making the right decisions.
And if there are mistakes that are being made right now, we've got the power to correct those decisions. We don't have to necessarily reconfigure the setup down there. What we do have to make sure of is, is that on each and every one of the decisions that are being made about what beaches to protect, what's going to happen with these marshes, if we build a barrier island, how is this going to have an impact on the ecology of the area over the long term--in each of those decisions, we've got to get it right.
Q. You understand the credibility of BP seems to be so bad to folks on down the shore that there's almost no----
The President. Right.
Q. ----trust that they're getting----
The President. I understand. And part of the purpose of this press conference is to explain to the folks down in the Gulf that ultimately it is our folks down there who are responsible. If they're not satisfied with something that's happening, then they need to let us know, and we will immediately question BP and ask them why isn't X, Y, Z happening. And those skimmers, those boats, that boom, the people who are out there collecting some of the oil that's already hit shore, they can be moved and redirected at any point.
And so, understandably, people are frustrated, because, look, this is a big mess coming to shore, and even if we've got a perfect organizational structure, spots are going to be missed, oil's going to go to places that maybe somebody thinks it could have been prevented from going. There is going to be damage that is heartbreaking to see. People's livelihoods are going to be affected in painful ways. The best thing for us to do is to make sure that every decision about how we're allocating the resources that we've got is being made based on the best expert advice that's available.
So I'll take one last stab at this, Chuck. The problem, I don't think, is that BP is off running around doing whatever it wants and nobody is minding the store. Inevitably in something this big, there are going to be places where things fall short. But I want everybody to understand today that our teams are authorized to direct BP in the same way that they'd be authorized to direct those same teams if they were technically being paid by the Federal Government. In either circumstance, we've got the authority that we need. We just got to make sure that we're exercising it effectively.
All right, Steve Thomma [McClatchy Newspapers].
Federal Response to Oil Spill/Federal Oversight of Offshore Drilling
Q. Thank you, sir. On April 21, Admiral Allen tells us, the Government started dispatching equipment rapidly to the Gulf, and you just said on day one, you recognized the enormity of this situation. Yet here we are 39, 40 days later, you're still having to rush more equipment, more boom. There are still areas of the coast unprotected. Why is it taking so long? And did you really act from day one for a worst-case scenario?
The President. We did. Part of the problem you've got is--let's take the example of boom. The way the plans have been developed--and I'm not an expert on this, but this is as it's been explained to me--predeploying boom would have been the right thing to do, making sure that there is boom right there in the region at various spots, where you could anticipate, if there was a spill of this size, the boom would be right there ready to grab.
Unfortunately, that wasn't always the case. And so this goes back to something that Jake asked earlier. When it comes to the response since the crisis happened, I am very confident that the Federal Government has acted consistently with a sense of urgency.
When it comes to prior to this accident happening, I think there was a lack of anticipating what the worst-case scenarios would be. And that's a problem. And part of that problem was lodged in MMS and the way that that agency was structured. That was the agency in charge of providing permitting and making decisions in terms of where drilling could take place, but also in charge of enforcing the safety provisions. And as I indicated before, the IG report, the Inspector General's report that came out, was scathing in terms of the problems there.
And when Ken Salazar came in, he cleaned a lot of that up. But more needed to be done and more needs to be done, which is part of the reason why he's separated out the permitting function from the functions that involve enforcing the various safety regulations.
But I think on a whole bunch of fronts, you had a complacency when it came to what happens in the worst-case scenario.
I'll give you another example, because this is something that some of you have written about, the question of how is it that oil companies kept on getting environmental waivers in getting their permits approved. Well, it turns out that the way the process works, first of all, there is a thorough environmental review as to whether a certain portion of the Gulf should be leased or not. That's a thoroughgoing environmental evaluation. Then the overall lease is broken up into segments for individual leases, and again, there's an environmental review that's done.
But when it comes to a specific company with its exploration plan in that one particular area--they're going to drill right here in this spot--Congress mandated that only 30 days could be allocated before a yes or no answer was given. That was by law. So MMS's hands were tied. And as a consequence, what became the habit, predating my administration, was you just automatically gave the environmental waiver because you couldn't complete an environmental study in 30 days.
So what you've got is a whole bunch of aspects to how oversight was exercised in deepwater drilling that were very problematic. And that's why it's so important that this Commission moves forward and examines, from soup to nuts, why did this happen, how should this proceed in a safe, effective manner, what's required when it comes to worst-case scenarios to prevent something like this from happening.
I continue to believe that oil production is important, domestic oil production is important. But I also believe we can't do this stuff if we don't have confidence that we can prevent crises from--like this from happening again. And it's going to take some time for the experts to make those determinations. And as I said, in the meantime",", I think it's appropriate that we keep in place the moratorium that I've already issued. Okay.
Chip Reid [CBS News].
Minerals Management Service
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, Elizabeth Birnbaum resigned today. Did she resign? Was she fired? Was she forced out? And if so, why? And should other heads roll as we go on here?
Secondly, with regard to the Minerals Management Service, Secretary Salazar yesterday basically blamed the Bush administration for the cozy relationship there, and you seemed to suggest that when you spoke in the Rose Garden a few weeks ago, when you said, for too long, a decade or more--most of those years, of course, the Bush administration--there's been a cozy relationship between the oil companies and the Federal agency that permits them to drill. But you knew as soon as you came in--and Secretary Salazar did--about this cozy relationship, but you continued to give permits, some of them under questionable circumstances. Is it fair to blame the Bush administration? Don't you deserve some of that?
The President. Well, let me just make the point that I made earlier, which is, Salazar came in and started cleaning house, but the culture had not fully changed in MMS. And absolutely, I take responsibility for that. There wasn't sufficient urgency in terms of the pace of how those changes needed to take place.
There's no evidence that some of the corrupt practices that had taken place earlier took place under the current administration's watch. But a culture in which oil companies were able to get what they wanted without sufficient oversight and regulation--that was a real problem. Some of it was constraints of the law, as I just mentioned, but we should have busted through those constraints.
Now, with respect to Ms. Birnbaum, I found out about her resignation today. Ken Salazar's been in testimony throughout the day, so I don't know the circumstances in which this occurred. I can tell you what I've said to Ken Salazar, which is that we have to make sure, if we are going forward with domestic oil production, that the Federal agency charged with overseeing its safety and security is operating at the highest level. And I want people in there who are operating at the highest level and aren't making excuses when things break down, but are intent on fixing them. And I have confidence that Ken Salazar can do that.
Q. And his job is safe?
The President. Yes.
Julianna [Julianna Goldman, Bloomberg News].
Dissemination of Information Regarding Oil Spill
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. We're learning today that oil--the oil has been gushing as much as five times the initial estimates. What does that tell you and the American people the--about the extent to which BP can be trusted on any of the information that it's providing, whether the events leading up to the spill, any of their information?
The President. Right. Well, BP's interests are aligned with the public interest to the extent that they want to get this well capped. It's bad for their business. It's bad for their bottom line. They're going to be paying a lot of damages, and we'll be staying on them about that. So I think it's fair to say that they want this thing capped as badly as anybody does and they want to minimize the damage as much as they can.
I think it is a legitimate concern to question whether BP's interests in being fully forthcoming about the extent of the damage is aligned with the public interest. All right? I mean, they--their interests may be to minimize the damage, and to the extent that they have better information than anybody else, to not be fully forthcoming. So my attitude is, we have to verify whatever it is they say about the damage.
This is an area, by the way, where I do think our efforts fell short. And I'm not contradicting my prior point that people were working as hard as they could and doing the best that they could on this front. But I do believe that when the initial estimates came of--that there were--it was 5,000 barrels spilling into the ocean per day, that was based on satellite imagery and satellite data that would give a rough calculation. At that point, BP already had a camera down there, but wasn't fully forthcoming in terms of what did those pictures look like. And when you set it up in time-lapse photography, experts could then make a more accurate determination. The administration pushed them to release it, but they should have pushed them sooner. I mean, I think that it took too long for us to stand up our flow-tracking group that has now made these more accurate ranges of calculation.
Now, keep in mind that that didn't change what our response was. As I said, from the start, we understood that this could be really bad. We are hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst. And so there aren't steps that we would have taken in terms of trying to cap the well or skimming the surface or the in situ burns or preparing to make sure when this stuff hit shore that we could minimize the damage--all those steps would have been the same even if we had information that this flow was coming out faster.
And eventually, we would have gotten better information because by law, the Federal Government, if it's going to be charging BP for the damage that it causes, is going to have to do the best possible assessment. But there was a lag of several weeks that I think shouldn't have happened. Okay?
Helen Thomas [Hearst Newspapers]
Military Operations in Afghanistan/Pakistan
Q. Mr. President, when are you going to get out of Afghanistan? Why are we continuing to kill and die there? What is the real excuse? And don't give us this Bushism, ""If we don't go there, they'll all come here.""
The President. Well, Helen, the reason we originally went to Afghanistan was because that was the base from which attacks were launched that killed 3,000 people.
Q. [inaudible]
The President. And I'm going to get to your question, I promise. But I just want to remind people, we went there because the Taliban was harboring Al Qaida, which had launched an attack that killed 3,000 Americans.
Al Qaida escaped capture, and they set up in the border regions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Al Qaida has affiliates that not only provide them safe harbor but increasingly are willing to conduct their own terrorist operations, initially in Afghanistan and in Pakistan, but increasingly directed against Western targets and targets of our allies as well.
So it is absolutely critical that we dismantle that network of extremists that are willing to attack us. And they are currently----
Q. [inaudible]--a threat to us?
The President. Oh, well, they absolutely are a threat to us. They're a significant threat to us. I wouldn't be deploying young men and women into harm's way if I didn't think that they were an absolute threat to us.
Now, General McChrystal's strategy, which I think is the right one, is that we are going to clear out Taliban strongholds, we are going to strengthen the capacity of the Afghan military, and we are going to get them stood up in a way that allows us then to start drawing down our troops, but continuing to provide support for Afghan in its effort to create a stable government.
It is a difficult process. At the same time, we've also got to work with Pakistan so that they are more effective partners in dealing with the extremists that are within their borders. And it is a big, messy process. But we are making progress, in part because the young men and women under General McChrystal's supervision, as well as our coalition partners, are making enormous sacrifices, but also on the civilian side, we're starting to make progress in terms of building capacity that will allow us then to draw down with an effective partner. Okay?
Jackie Calmes, New York Times.
Energy/Federal Oversight of Offshore Drilling
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Is this on? Okay. I want to follow up on something--exchange you had with Chip. Leaving aside the existing permits for drilling in the Gulf, before--weeks before BP, you had called for expanded drilling. Do you now regret that decision? And why did you do so, knowing what you have described today about the sort of dysfunction in the MMS?
The President. I continue to believe what I said at that time, which was that domestic oil production is an important part of our overall energy mix. It has to be part of an overall energy strategy. I also believe that it is insufficient to meet the needs of our future, which is why I've made huge investments in clean energy, why we continue to promote solar and wind and biodiesel and a whole range of other approaches, why we're putting so much emphasis on energy efficiency.
But we're not going to be able to transition to these clean energy strategies right away. I mean, we're still years off and some technological breakthroughs away from being able to operate on purely a clean energy grid. During that time, we're going to be using oil. And to the extent that we're using oil, it makes sense for us to develop our oil and natural gas resources here in the United States and not simply rely on imports. That's important for our economy; that's important for economic growth.
So the overall framework, which is to say domestic oil production should be part of our overall energy mix, I think, continues to be the right one. Where I was wrong was in my belief that the oil companies had their act together when it came to worst-case scenarios.
Now, that wasn't based on just my blind acceptance of their statements. Oil drilling has been going on in the Gulf, including deepwater, for quite some time. And the record of accidents like this we hadn't seen before. But it just takes one for us to have a wake-up call and recognize that claims that fail-safe procedures were in place or that blowout preventers would function properly or that valves would switch on and shut things off, that--whether it's because of human error, because of--the technology was faulty, because when you're operating at these depths, you can't anticipate exactly what happens--those assumptions proved to be incorrect.
And so I'm absolutely convinced that we have to do a thoroughgoing scrub of that--those safety procedures and those safety records. And we have to have confidence that even if it's just a one-in-a-million shot, that we've got enough technology know-how that we can shut something like this down not in a month, not in 6 weeks, but in 2 or 3 or 4 days. And I don't have that confidence right now.
Minerals Management Service/Offshore Drilling Technologies/Energy
Q. If I could follow up----
The President. Sure.
Q. Do you--are you sorry now--do you regret that your team had not done the reforms at the Minerals Management Service that you've subsequently called for? And I'm also curious as how it is that you didn't know about Ms. Birnbaum's resignation/firing before----
The President. Well, you're assuming it was a firing. If it was a resignation, then she would have submitted a letter to Mr. Salazar this morning, at a time when I had a whole bunch of other stuff going on.
Q. So you rule out that she was fired?
The President. I'm--come on, Jackie, I don't know. I'm telling you the--I found out about it this morning, so I don't yet know the circumstances, and Ken Salazar's been in testimony on the Hill.
With respect to your first question, at MMS, Ken Salazar was in the process of making these reforms. But the point that I'm making is, is that obviously they weren't happening fast enough. If they had been happening fast enough, this might have been caught. Now, it's possible that it might not have been caught. All right? I mean, we could have gone through a whole new process for environmental review; you could have had a bunch of technical folks take a look at BP's plans, and they might have said, this is--meets industry standards, we haven't had an accident like this in 15 years, and we should go ahead.
That's what this Commission has to discover, is, was this a systemic breakdown? Is this something that could happen once in a million times? Is it something that could happen once in a thousand times or once every 5,000 times? What exactly are the risks involved?
Now, let me make one broader point, though, about energy. The fact that oil companies now have to go a mile underwater and then drill another 3 miles below that in order to hit oil tells us something about the direction of the oil industry. Extraction is more expensive, and it is going to be inherently more risky.
And so that's part of the reason you never heard me say, ""Drill, baby, drill,"" because we can't drill our way out of the problem. It may be part of the mix as a bridge to a transition to new technologies and new energy sources, but we should be pretty modest in understanding that the easily accessible oil is already been sucked up out of the ground.
And as we are moving forward, the technology gets more complicated, the oil sources are more remote, and that means that there's probably going to end up being more risk. And we as a society are going to have to make some very serious determinations in terms of what risks are we willing to accept. And that's part of what the Commission, I think, has to--is going to have to look at.
I will tell you, though, that understanding we need to grow--we--we're going to be consuming oil in terms--for our industries and for how people live in this country, we're going to have to start moving on this transition. And that's why when I went to the Republican caucus just this week, I said to them, let's work together. You've got Lieberman and Kerry, who previously were working with Lindsey Graham--even though Lindsey's not on the bill right now--coming up with a framework that has the potential to get bipartisan support and says, yes, we're going to still need oil production, but you know what, we can see what's out there on the horizon, and it's a problem if we don't start changing how we operate. Okay?
Macarena Vidal [EFE News]. Not here? Oh, there you are.
U.S. Border Security/Arizona's Illegal Immigration Enforcement Legislation
Q. Mr. President, you announced--or the White House announced on--2 days ago that you were going to send 1,200 people to--1,200 members of the National Guard to the border. I wanted to--if you could precise what their target is going to be, what you're planning to achieve with that--if you could clarify a bit more the mission that they're going to have.
And also, on Arizona, after you having criticized so much the immigration law that has been approved there, would you support the boycott that some organizations are calling towards that State?
The President. Okay. I've indicated that I don't approve of the Arizona law. I think it's the wrong approach. I understand the frustrations of the people of Arizona and a lot of folks along the border that that border has not been entirely secured in a way that is both true our--to our traditions as a nation of law and as a nation of immigrants.
I'm President of the United States; I don't endorse boycotts--or not endorse boycotts. That's something that the private citizens can make a decision about. What my administration is doing is examining very closely this Arizona law and its implications for the civil rights and civil liberties of the people in Arizona, as well as the concern that you start getting a patchwork of 50 different immigration laws around the country in an area that is inherently the job of the Federal Government.
Now, for the Federal Government to do its job, everybody's got to step up. And so I've tried to be as clear as I could this week, and I will repeat it to everybody who's here: We have to have a comprehensive approach to immigration reform. The time to get moving on this is now. And I am prepared to work with both parties and Members of Congress to get a bill that does a good job securing our borders, holds employers accountable, makes sure that those who have come here illegally have to pay a fine, pay back taxes, learn English, and get right by the law.
We have the opportunity to do that. We've done--we've gotten a vote of a supermajority in the Senate just 4 years ago. There's no reason why we shouldn't be able to recreate that bipartisan spirit to get this problem solved.
Now, with respect to the National Guardsmen and women, I have authorized up to 1,200 National Guardspersons in a plan that was actually shaped last year. So this is not simply in response to the Arizona law. And what we find is, is that National Guardspersons can help on intelligence, dealing with both drug and human trafficking along the borders. They can relieve border guards so that the border guards then can be in charge of law enforcement in those areas. So there are a lot of functions that they can carry out that helps leverage and increase the resources available in this area.
By the way, we didn't just send National Guard. We've also got a package of $500 million in additional resources, because, for example, if we are doing a better job dealing with trafficking along the border, we've also got to make sure that we've got prosecutors down there who can prosecute those cases.
But the key point I want to emphasize to you is that I don't see these issues in isolation. We're not going to solve the problem just solely as a consequence of sending National Guard troops down there. We're going to solve this problem because we have created an orderly, fair, humane immigration framework in which people are able to immigrate to this country in a legal fashion, employers are held accountable for hiring legally present workers.
And I think we can craft that system if everybody is willing to step up. And I told the Republican caucus when I met with them this week, I don't even need you to meet me halfway; meet me a quarter of the way. I'll bring the majority of Democrats to a smart, sensible, comprehensive immigration reform bill, but I'm going to have to have some help, given the rules of the Senate, where a simple majority is not enough. Okay?
Last question. Major [Major Garrett, FOX News].
Federal Response to Oil Spill/Representative Joe Sestak
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Good afternoon.
The President. Good afternoon.
Q. Two issues. Some in your Government have said the Federal Government's boot is on the neck of BP. Are you comfortable with that imagery, sir? Is your boot on the neck of BP? And can you understand, sir, why some in the Gulf who feel besieged by this oil spill consider that a meaningless, possibly ludicrous, metaphor?
Secondarily, can you tell the American public, sir, what your White House did or did not offer Congressman Sestak to not enter the Democratic senatorial primary? And how will you meet your levels of expressed transparency and ethics to convey that answer to satisfy what appear to be bipartisan calls for greater disclosure about that matter?
The President. The----
Q. Thank you.
The President. There will be an official response shortly on the Sestak issue, which I hope will answer your questions.
Q. From you, sir?
The President. You will get it from my administration. So--and it will be coming out--when I say ""shortly,"" I mean shortly. I don't mean weeks or months. With respect to the first----
Q. Can you assure the public it was ethical and legal, sir?
The President. I can assure the public that nothing improper took place. But as I said, there will be a response shortly on that issue.
With respect to the metaphor that was used, I think Ken Salazar would probably be the first one to admit that he has been frustrated, angry, and occasionally emotional about this issue, like a lot of people have. I mean, there are a lot of folks out there who see what's happening and are angry at BP, are frustrated that it hasn't stopped. And so I'll let Ken answer for himself. I would say that we don't need to use language like that. What we need is actions that make sure that BP is being held accountable. And that's what I intend to do, and I think that's what Ken Salazar intends to do.
But look, we've gone through a difficult year and a half. This is just one more bit of difficulty. And this is going to be hard not just right now; it's going to be hard for months to come. The Gulf----
Q. This spill?
The President. This spill. The Gulf is going to be affected in a bad way. And so my job right now is just to make sure that everybody in the Gulf understands this is what I wake up to in the morning and this is what I go to bed at night thinking about.
Q. The spill?
The President. The spill. The--and it's not just me, by the way. When I woke up this morning and I'm shaving and Malia knocks on my bathroom door and she peeks in her head and she says, ""Did you plug the hole yet, Daddy?"" Because I think everybody understands that when we are fouling the Earth like this, it has concrete implications not just for this generation, but for future generations.
I grew up in Hawaii where the ocean is sacred. And when you see birds flying around with oil all over their feathers and turtles dying and--that doesn't just speak to the immediate economic consequences of this; this speaks to how are we caring for this incredible bounty that we have.
And so sometimes when I hear folks down in Louisiana expressing frustrations, I may not always think that their comments are fair; on the other hand, I probably think to myself, these are folks who grew up fishing in these wetlands and seeing this as an integral part of who they are, and to see that messed up in this fashion would be infuriating.
So the thing that the American people need to understand is that not a day goes by where the Federal Government is not constantly thinking about how do we make sure that we minimize the damage on this, we close this thing down, we review what happened to make sure that it does not happen again. And in that sense, there are analogies to what's been happening in terms of in the financial markets and some of these other areas where big crises happen. It forces us to do some soul-searching. And I think that's important for all of us to do.
In the meantime, my job is to get this fixed. And in case anybody wonders--in any of your reporting, in case you're wondering who's responsible, I take responsibility. It is my job to make sure that everything is done to shut this down. That doesn't mean it's going to be easy. It doesn't mean it's going to happen right away or the way I'd like it to happen. It doesn't mean that we're not going to make mistakes. But there shouldn't be any confusion here: The Federal Government is fully engaged, and I'm fully engaged.
All right? Thank you very much, everybody."
"July 20, 2010",The President's News Conference With Prime Minister David Cameron of the United Kingdom,Barack Obama,"Barack Obama, The President's News Conference With Prime Minister David Cameron of the United Kingdom Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/288369",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-david-cameron-the-united-kingdom,"President Obama. Good afternoon, everybody. Please have a seat. It is my great pleasure to welcome Prime Minister Cameron on his first visit to the White House as Prime Minister.
We have just concluded some excellent discussions, including whether the beers from our hometowns that we exchanged are best served warm or cold. My understanding is, is that the Prime Minister enjoyed our 312 beer, and we may send him some more. I thought the beer we got was excellent, but I did drink it cold. [Laughter]
Mr. Prime Minister, we can never say it enough: The United States and the United Kingdom enjoy a truly special relationship. We celebrate a common heritage. We cherish common values. And we speak a common language, most of the time. We honor the sacrifices of our brave men and women in uniform who have served together, bled together, and even lay at rest together.
Above all, our alliance thrives because it advances our common interests. Whether it's preventing the spread of nuclear weapons or securing vulnerable nuclear materials, thwarting terrorist attacks or confronting climate change or promoting global economic growth and development, when the United States and the United Kingdom stand together, our people, and people around the world, are more secure and they are more prosperous.
In short, the United States has no closer ally and no stronger partner than Great Britain. And I appreciate the opportunity to renew our relationship with my partner, Prime Minister Cameron.
In his campaign, David was known for his extensive town hall discussions with voters: ""Cameron Direct."" And that's the same spirit that we had here today. I appreciate David's steady leadership and his pragmatic approach. And just as he's off to an energetic start at home, I think we've had a brilliant start as partners who see eye to eye on virtually every challenge before us.
Great Britain is one of our largest trading partners, and we're committed to long-term, sustainable growth that keeps the global economy growing and puts our people to work. I told David that my administration's working hard with the Senate to move forward as soon as possible with our defense trade treaty with the U.K., which will be good for our workers and our troops in both our countries.
We reaffirmed our commitment to fiscal responsibility and reform. David's government is making some courageous decisions, and I've set a goal of cutting our deficit in half by 2013. Tomorrow I'll sign into law the toughest financial reforms since the aftermath of the Great Depression. And I commend David for his leadership in Europe to rebuild confidence in the financial sector. Together, we're determined to make sure the financial catastrophe that we are emerging from never happens again.
We discussed the Middle East, where both our governments are working to encourage Israelis and Palestinians to move to direct talks as soon as possible.
We discussed the continuing threat posed by Iran's nuclear program. On this we are united: The Iranian Government must fulfill its international obligations. The new sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council, the United States, and other countries are putting unprecedented pressure on the Iranian Government. And I thanked David for Great Britain's efforts to ensure strong European Union sanctions in the coming days.
Along with our P-5-plus-1 partners, we remain committed to a diplomatic solution. But the Iranian Government must understand that the path of defiance will only bring more pressure and more isolation.
Finally, much of our discussion focused on Afghanistan. After the United States, Great Britain is the largest contributor of combat forces in Afghanistan, and British troops and civilians have served and sacrificed in some of the most dangerous parts of the country.
This is not an easy fight, but it is a necessary one. Terrorists trained in Afghanistan and the tribal regions along the Pakistani border have killed innocent civilians in both of our countries. And an even wider insurgency in Afghanistan would mean an even larger safe haven for Al Qaida and its terrorist affiliates to plan their next attack. And we are not going to let that happen.
We have the right strategy. We're going to break the Taliban's momentum. We're going to build Afghan capacity so Afghans can take responsibility for their future. And we're going to deepen regional cooperation, including with Pakistan.
Now, today's historic Kabul conference is another major step forward. The Afghan Government presented, and its international partners unanimously endorsed, concrete plans to implement President Karzai's commitments to improve security, economic growth, governance, and the delivery of basic services. The Afghan Government presented its peace and reconciliation plan, which the United States firmly supports. Agreement was reached on a plan in which responsibility for security in Afghan Provinces will transition to Afghan security forces. In addition, Afghanistan and Pakistan reached a historic agreement to increase economic opportunity for people on both sides of the border.
So these are all important achievements, and they go a long way toward helping create the conditions needed for Afghans to assume greater responsibility for their country. Indeed, over the coming year, Afghans will begin to take the lead in security, and in July of next year will begin to transfer--we will begin to transfer some of our forces out of Afghanistan. And the Kabul conference shows that the Afghan--that Afghanistan has the support of the international community, including the United States, which will remain a long-term partner for the security and progress of the Afghan people.
As we go forward, we want to honor our fallen warriors with the respect and gratitude that they deserve, whether it's here at Dover or in the small British town of Wootton Bassett, where people line the streets in a solemn tribute that represents the best of the British character. With pride in their service and determination to carry on their work for a safer world, I am confident that we can be worthy of their sacrifice.
And I am confident that with my partner and friend, David Cameron, the special relationship between our countries will only grow stronger in the years to come.
Mr. Prime Minister.
Prime Minister Cameron. Well, first of all, can I thank you, Mr. President, for welcoming me so warmly to the White House today? Thank you for the meeting, for the lunch that we had, and also for the tour of part of your home. I have to say, I was most impressed by how tidy your children's bedrooms were. [Laughter] And I think if the President of the United States can get his children to tidy their bedrooms, then the British Prime Minister, it's about time----
President Obama. You can do it.
Prime Minister Cameron. ----he did exactly the same thing. [Laughter]
President Obama. You have to give them some notice, that's the only thing. [Laughter]
Prime Minister Cameron. Right. Well, they've got notice.
President Obama. Tell them the Prime Minister is coming. [Laughter]
Prime Minister Cameron. They should be in bed by now, but if they're not, they have notice. [Laughter]
I think we did have a very valuable opportunity today to discuss in real depth a strong and a shared agenda on Afghanistan, on global economic recovery, and on the Middle East. And this relationship isn't just, as you put it, an extraordinary special relationship. To me, it is also an absolutely essential relationship if we are going to deliver the security and the prosperity that our people need. And I thought again today in our discussions just how closely aligned our interests are on all of the issues that we discussed.
First, on Afghanistan, there is no clearer, no more tangible illustration of Britain and America standing shoulder to shoulder in our national interest than this mission that we are engaged in together. We have British troops working to an American commander in Helmand, and we have American troops working to a British commander in Kandahar.
Today President Obama and I took stock of progress in this vital year. We reaffirmed our commitment to the overall strategy. A key part of that is training the Afghan National Army and police so they can provide security for their country and our troops can come home.
We also agreed on the need to reinvigorate the political strategy for Afghanistan. Insurgencies tend not to be defeated by military means alone. There must also be political settlement. And to those people currently fighting, if they give up violence, if they cut themselves off from Al Qaida, if they accept the basic tenets of the Afghan Constitution, they can have a future in a peaceful Afghanistan.
There is real progress. Last weekend, the first Afghan-led military operation took place successfully in Helmand, Afghans defending themselves. And today, as Barack has just said, for the first time in decades, the Government of Afghanistan has hosted an international conference on its own soil. Over 40 foreign ministers and 80 delegations assembled in Kabul to monitor progress and drive forward the international strategy. That is a real achievement, and we should congratulate President Karzai on it.
President Obama and I also discussed the economy. We're both taking action that our countries need. Our destination is a strong and stable growth, a sustained economic recovery, and a reformed financial system that will never again be open to the abuses of the past. We are confident that the right steps were taken at the Toronto G-20 summit to help achieve that.
The Middle East was the third area that we focused on today. We both want a secure, peaceful, and stable Middle East. And that means two things. First, as Barack has just said, Iran must give up its pursuit of a nuclear weapon. We urge the Iranian regime to resume negotiations with the international community without delay. It's not too late for it to do so. America and Britain, with our partners, stand ready to negotiate, and to do so in good faith. But in the absence of a willing partner, we will implement with vigor the sanctions package agreed by the United Nations Security Council, and in Europe, we will be taking further steps as well.
Second, we desperately need a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians that provides security, justice, and hope. As we were discussing over lunch, it is time for direct talks, not least because it is time for each, Israel and Palestine, to test the seriousness of the other.
On BP, which we discussed at some length, I completely understand the anger that exists right across America. The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is a catastrophe for the environment, for the fishing industry, for tourism. I've been absolutely clear about that. And like President Obama, I've also been clear that it is BP's role to cap the leak, to clean up the mess, and to pay appropriate compensation. I'm in regular touch with senior management at BP, and the President is too, to make sure that happens. And the progress that's been made to cap the leak is a step in the right direction.
Equally, of course, BP is an important company to both the British and the American economies. Thousands of jobs on both sides of the Atlantic depend on it. So it's in the interest of both our countries, as we agreed, that it remains a strong and stable company for the future. And that's something we discussed today.
And let us not confuse the oil spill with the Libyan bomber. I've been absolutely clear about this right from the start, and in our meeting, we had what we call a violent agreement, which is that releasing the Lockerbie bomber, a mass murderer of 270 people, the largest act of terrorism ever committed in the United Kingdom, was completely wrong.
He showed his victims no compassion. They were not allowed to die in their beds at home, surrounded by their families. So in my view, neither should that callous killer have been given that luxury. That wasn't a decision taken by BP; it was a decision taken by the Scottish Government. We have to accept that under the laws of my country, where power on certain issues is devolved to Scotland, this was a decision for the Scottish Executive, a decision that they took.
I know that Senator Kerry's committee is looking into these issues. My Government will engage constructively with those hearings. And, indeed, my Foreign Secretary has already set out the Government's position.
So let me thank you again, Barack, for hosting me today. While at the World Cup, our teams could only manage a score draw. I believe our relationship can be a win-win. And, yes, I did enjoy drinking the 312 beer--cold--during the World Cup. [Laughter] I enjoyed it so much that when I watched Germany beat Argentina, I actually cheered for Germany. That's something that's a big admission for a British person to make, so the beer is obviously very effective. [Laughter]
But what you said, Barack, though, about British and American soldiers fighting together, sometimes dying together, serving together, is absolutely right. And we should never forget that, whether it's on the beaches of Normandy, whether it's in Korea, whether in Iraq, or whether now in Afghanistan.
Our relationship is one that has an incredibly rich history. It is based on ties of culture and history and, yes, emotion too. But for all those things, I think it has also an incredibly strong future that is based on results--results of a positive partnership of working together, agreeing where we agree; when we have disagreements, working through them and coming to a fair conclusion. It's a partnership that I profoundly want to make work as well as it possibly can in the years that I'm Prime Minister of Britain and with you as President of the United States.
So thank you again for welcoming me here today.
President Obama. Thank you, David.
With that, we're going to take a few questions. And I'm going to start with Mimi Hall of USA Today.
Release of Convicted Terrorist Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al-Megrahi/United Kingdom-U.S. Relations
Q. Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Prime Minister. I wanted to ask you a little bit more about BP. You mentioned, Mr. Prime Minister, your decision to cooperate, et cetera, but you said we shouldn't confuse the two. Have you flatly ruled out opening a Government investigation into the events around the release of the bomber?
And, President Obama, how do you feel about a congressional investigation into this? Would you like to see that happen, or do you think that confuses the two events?
President Obama. Well, why don't I start off, and I'll throw it over to David. I think all of us here in the United States were surprised, disappointed, and angry about the release of the Lockerbie bomber. And my administration expressed very clearly our objections prior to the decision being made and subsequent to the decision being made. So we welcome any additional information that will give us insights and a better understanding of why the decision was made.
But I think that the key thing to understand here is that we've got a British Prime Minister who shares our anger over the decision, who also objects to how it played out. And so I'm fully supportive of Prime Minister Cameron's efforts to gain a better understanding of it, to clarify it. But the bottom line is, is that we all disagreed with it. It was a bad decision. And going forward, that has to inform how we approach our relationship with respect to counterterrorism generally.
Now, one of the things that I want to emphasize that I think may get lost in this current debate is the extraordinarily strong ties between our two countries when it comes to fighting terrorism. We probably have the best coordination and cooperation of any two countries in the world. And those relationships are vital, and they keep people safe on both sides of the Atlantic.
And I want to make sure that even as we may express concern about what happened with respect to the release of this particular individual, that we stay focused on the cooperation that currently exists and build on that cooperation to make sure that there is no diminution of our joint efforts to make sure that the kinds of attacks that happened over Lockerbie do not happen again.
Prime Minister Cameron. Well, I agree with actually what's been said about the importance of the security cooperation, something we discussed today. On Megrahi, look, I'm not standing here today and saying it was a bad decision to release Megrahi because I'm here. I said this a year ago, at the time, that it was a bad decision. It shouldn't have been made. The British Government, as well, should have been clear that it was a bad decision, rather than going along with it. I took that very clear view. This was the biggest mass murderer in British history, and there was no business in letting him out of prison.
In terms of an inquiry, there has been an inquiry by the Scottish Parliament into the way the decision was made. The British Government--the last British Government released a whole heap of information about this decision. But I've asked the Cabinet Secretary today to go back through all of the paperwork and see if more needs to be published about the background to this decision.
But in terms of an inquiry, I'm not currently minded that we need to have a U.K.-based inquiry on this, partly for this reason: I don't need an inquiry to tell me what was a bad decision. It was a bad decision. And if you like, the big fact that's changed over the year that makes it an even worse decision is the fact that, of course, Megrahi is still free, at liberty, in Libya, rather than serving the prison sentence in Scotland, as he should be doing.
So that's what we're going to do, is go back over this information, see if more needs to be published, and of course, in terms of the congressional hearing, make sure that proper cooperation is extended to it.
President Obama. Somebody you want to call?
Prime Minister Cameron. Right. I think James Landale [BBC News].
U.S. Inquiry Into the Release of Convicted Terrorist Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al-Megrahi
Q. Just to stay on that subject, if we may. Mr. Prime Minister, first of all, would you be prepared to talk to your predecessors, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, to get their agreements to release any documents if they are relevant to the paper search that the Cabinet Secretary will undergo?
And, Mr. President, can I ask you--the Prime Minister says he opposes an inquiry. Hillary Clinton has demanded an inquiry. Where do you stand?
President Obama. Well, go ahead, David.
Prime Minister Cameron. Well, first of all, on the documents, the proper process here is that the Cabinet Secretary should look back over this decision and the circumstances surrounding it, should identify those documents that should be published. It should be right that Ministers in the previous Government should be consulted about the publication of those documents. And of course we will consult with them over that.
But in my view, there is absolutely no harm to be done in giving the fullest possible explanation of the circumstances surrounding this decision. I think the key thing, though, to remember is that in the end, it was a decision by the Scottish Executive.
On the issue of an inquiry, as I said, I'm not currently minded to hold an inquiry because I think publishing this information, combined with the inquiry that has already been, will give people the certainty that they need about the circumstances surrounding this decision. But the key thing is to get the information out there so people can see. But I don't think there's any great mystery here. There was a decision taken by the Scottish Executive, in my view, a wholly wrong and misguided decision, a bad decision, but the decision nonetheless. That's what happened. And I don't think we need an extra inquiry to tell us that that's what happened. But the information, as I said, will be gone over and published, as appropriate. And of course I'll be consulting with previous Ministers and Prime Ministers, as you should do in the normal way.
President Obama. I think the simple answer is, we should have all the facts; they should be laid out there. And I have confidence that Prime Minister Cameron's government will be cooperative in making sure that the facts are there. That will not negate the fact that, as the Prime Minister indicated, it was a very poor decision and one that not only ran contrary to, I think, how we should be treating terrorists, but also didn't reflect the incredible pain that the families who were affected still suffer to this day. And my administration is in regular contact with these families, and this was a heartbreaking decision for them that reopened a whole host of new wounds.
So my expectation is, is that the facts will be out there, and, as David indicated, with all the facts out, I think we're going to be back to where we are right now, which it was--it's--it was a decision that should not have been made and one that we should learn from going forward.
Laura Meckler [Wall Street Journal].
Global Economy/Release of Convicted Terrorist Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al-Megrahi/Oil Spill in the Gulf of Mexico
Q. Thank you. Mr. President, in your opening statement, you referred to the fact that the British Government has been taking some very tough steps towards--to get their budget in order, and you said you had committed to cut the deficit in half. Could you talk about whether you think that those decisions are going to be--the decisions that they're making there are going to be needed to be made here on a similar level beyond pledges?
And, Mr. Prime Minister, specifically, could you address the matter of what role BP had in lobbying for the release of this man, and whether an inquiry or the review that you're planning is going to look at that specific question? Thank you.
President Obama. When I came into office in January of 2009, I was very clear at the time--even before we knew the severity of the recession that we would experience--that we have a structural deficit that is unsustainable, and that for our long-term growth and prosperity, we are going to have to get a handle on that. I talked about that during my campaign. I talked about it in the days after I was elected. I talked about it after I had been sworn in.
We had an emergency situation on our hands, and so the entire world, working through the G-20, coordinated in making sure that we filled this huge dropoff in demand. We got the economy growing again. And we had to take a number of steps, some of which were unpopular and that, yes, added to the short-term deficit.
What I also said at the time was we are then going to make sure, number one, that we pay down whatever additional deficit had been added as a consequence of the Recovery Act and other steps that we had to take last year, but then we're still going to have to go back and deal with these long-term structural deficits.
And, in fact, in the first G-20 visit that I made, in April to England, I was very clear to the rest of the world that what they cannot rely on is an economic model in which the United States borrows--consumers in the United States borrow, we take out home equity loans, we run up credit cards to purchase goods from all around the world. We cannot alone be the economic engine for the rest of the world's growth. So that rebalancing ended up being a central part of our long-term strategy working with the G-20.
Now, what we've done is we've initiated a freeze on our domestic discretionary budget. We are on the path to cutting our deficits in half. We have put forward a fiscal commission that is then going to examine how do we deal with these broader structural deficits. So this isn't just an empty promise. We've already started taking steps to deal with it, and we're going to be very aggressive in how we deal with it.
Now, our two countries are in slightly different situations. Their financial situation is slightly different; their levels of debt relative to GDP are somewhat higher. And as David and I discussed when we saw each other in Toronto, the goal here is the same, and we're all moving in the same direction. But there's going to be differentiation based on the different circumstances of different countries in terms of how they approach it tactically and at what pace.
But I can assure you this: that my administration is squarely committed not just to dealing with the short-term deficit and debt, which in some ways is the least troubling aspect of this problem, what we're going to have to tackle are some big structural reforms that are going to be tough. And they're going to be that much tougher because we're coming out of a recession as we do it. But I think that as we continue to see economic growth, as we continue to see the economy heal from last year, that the American people are going to want to approach this problem in a serious, realistic way. We owe it for the next generation.
And my hope is, is that we're going to end up getting a bipartisan solution to this thing that is realistic. And one concern that I have obviously is the politics of deficits and debt. When I announced that I was in favor of this fiscal commission, at the time, I had a number of Republicans who were cosponsors of the legislation who suddenly reversed themselves because, I suppose, I supported it.
And fortunately, what I've seen so far, all the reports from the fiscal commission, is that people are serious about this. Both Republicans and Democrats on the commission are taking their task seriously. I think it's going to be a good report, but is still going to require some tough choices, and we're committing to pursuing those tough choices after we get that report.
David.
Prime Minister Cameron. Thank you. You asked about the role of BP. I mean, the role of BP and any lobbying they might have done is an issue for BP and an issue that they should explain themselves. I mean, the decision to release Megrahi, though, was a decision made by the Scottish Government, and I haven't seen anything to suggest that the Scottish Government were in any way swayed by BP. They were swayed by their considerations about the need to release him on compassionate grounds, grounds that I think were completely wrong. I don't think it's right to show compassion to a mass murderer like that. I think it was wrong.
But it's a matter for BP to answer what activities they undertook. But the Scottish Government made its decision and has explained its decision on many occasions, and I'm sure will explain it again.
I'm very keen that we are clear here that BP should, rightly, be blamed for what has happened in the Gulf, and have real responsibilities to cap the well, to clean up the spill, to pay compensation--all of which they are getting on with, including putting aside the £20 billion in the escrow account. I think--$20 billion, sorry. I think they've made good progress on that, and further progress needs to be made.
I think it's important to separate that from the decision to release Al-Megrahi, which, as I say, was a decision made by the Scottish Government and, as so far has been shown in investigations by the Scottish Parliament, was a decision which I wholly disagree with but, nonetheless, was taken in an appropriate way.
I think we have a question from Tom Bradby.
Cybersecurity/Extradition of Gary McKinnon to the U.S.
Q. Mr. President, Tom Bradby, ITV News. Quite a lot of people in the U.K. feel that your determination as a country to continue to push for the extradition of computer hacker and Asperger's sufferer Gary McKinnon is disproportionate and somewhat harsh. Do you think it is time now to consider some leniency in this case?
And, Prime Minister, you've expressed very strong views on this matter, suggesting that Mr. McKinnon shouldn't be extradited. Your Deputy Prime Minister has expressed even stronger views. Did you discuss that with the President today? And if not, would now be a good moment to share your views with us once again?
Prime Minister Cameron. Shall I go?
President Obama. Please, go ahead.
Prime Minister Cameron. It is something that we discussed in our meeting. I mean, clearly there's a discussion going on between the British and the Americans about this, and I don't want to prejudice those discussions. We completely understand that Gary McKinnon stands accused of a very important and significant crime in terms of hacking into vital databases. And nobody denies that that is an important crime that has to be considered. But I have had conversations with the U.S. Ambassador, as well as raising it today with the President, about this issue, and I hope a way through can be found.
President Obama. Well, one of the things that David and I discussed was the increasing challenge that we're going to face as a consequence of the Internet and the need for us to cooperate extensively on issues of cybersecurity.
We had a brief discussion about the fact that although there may still be efforts to send in spies and try to obtain state secrets through traditional cold war methods, the truth of the matter is, these days, where we're going to see enormous amounts of vulnerability when it comes to information is going to be through these kind of breaches in our information systems. So we take this very seriously. And I know that the British Government does as well.
Beyond that, one of the traditions we have is the President doesn't get involved in decisions around prosecutions, extradition matters. So what I expect is that my team will follow the law, but they will also coordinate closely with what we've just stated is an ally that is unparalleled in terms of our cooperative relationship. And I trust that this will get resolved in a way that underscores the seriousness of the issue, but also underscores the fact that we work together and we can find an appropriate ","solution.
All right? Thank you very much, everybody.
Prime Minister Cameron. Thank you very much."

Harper of Canada Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/289296",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-stephen-j-harper-canada-0,"President Obama. Good afternoon, everyone. Please be seated.
I am very pleased to be welcoming my great friend and partner, Prime Minister Stephen Harper, back to the White House to reaffirm our extraordinary friendship and cooperation between the United States and Canada. I'd like to talk a bit about what we accomplished today and then address the situation unfolding in Egypt.
The United States and Canada are not simply allies, not simply neighbors; we are woven together like perhaps no other two countries in the world. We're bound together by our societies, by our economies, by our families--which reminds me, my brother-in-law's birthday is today, and I have to call him. [Laughter]
And in our many meetings together, I've come to value Stephen's candor and his focus on getting results, both when it comes to our two countries and to meeting global challenges. Although I, unfortunately, have not yet had the pleasure of seeing him and his band jam to the Rolling Stones, but I'm told the videos have become a sensation on YouTube. So I'll be checking those out after this bilateral. [Laughter]
We've had a very successful day. Our focus has been on how we increase jobs and economic growth on both sides of the border. Canada is our largest trading partner and the top destination for American exports, supporting some 1.7 million jobs here. So today we've agreed to several important steps to increase trade, improve our competitiveness, and create jobs for both our people.
First, we agreed to a new vision for managing our shared responsibilities, not just at the border, but beyond the border. That means working more closely to improve border security with better screening, new technologies, and information sharing among law enforcement, as well as identifying threats early. It also means finding new ways to improve the free flow of goods and people. Because with over a billion dollars in trade crossing the border every single day, smarter border management is key to our competitiveness, our job creation, and my goal of doubling U.S. exports.
And, Mr. Prime Minister, I thank you for your leadership and commitment to reaching this agreement.
We've directed our teams to develop an action plan to move forward quickly, and I'm confident that we're going to get this done so that our shared border enhances our shared prosperity.
Second, we're launching a new effort to get rid of outdated regulations that stifle trade and job creation. Like the Governmentwide review that I ordered last month, we need to obviously strike the right balance, protecting our public health and safety and making it easier and less expensive for Americans and Canadians to trade and do business, for example, in the auto industry. And a new council that we're creating today will help make that happen.
Third, we discussed a wide range of ways to promote trade and investment, from clean energy partnerships to the steps Canada can take to strengthen intellectual property rights.
And we discussed a range of common security challenges, including Afghanistan, where our forces serve and sacrifice together. Today I want to thank Prime Minister Harper for Canada's decision to shift its commitment to focus on training Afghan forces. As we agreed with our Lisbon--or our NATO and coalition allies in Lisbon, the transition to Afghan lead for security will begin this year, and Canada's contribution will be critical to achieving that mission and keeping both our countries safe.
Finally, we discussed our shared commitment to progress with our partners in the Americas, including greater security cooperation. And I especially appreciated the Prime Minister's perspective on the region as I prepare for my trip to Central and South America next month.
Let me close by saying a few words about the situation in Egypt. This is obviously still a fluid situation, and we're monitoring it closely. So I'll make just a few points.
First, we continue to be crystal clear that we oppose violence as a response to this crisis. In recent days, we've seen violence and harassment erupt on the streets of Egypt that violates human rights, universal values, and international norms. So we are sending a strong and unequivocal message: Attacks on reporters are unacceptable, attacks on human rights activists are unacceptable, attacks on peaceful protesters are unacceptable.
The Egyptian Government has a responsibility to protect the rights of its people. Those demonstrating also have a responsibility to do so peacefully. But everybody should recognize a simple truth: The issues at stake in Egypt will not be resolved through violence or suppression. And we are encouraged by the restraint that was shown today. We hope that it continues.
Second, the future of Egypt will be determined by its people. It's also clear that there needs to be a transition process that begins now. That transition must initiate a process that respects the universal rights of the Egyptian people and that leads to free and fair elections.
The details of this transition will be worked out by Egyptians. And my understanding is that some discussions have begun. But we are consulting widely within Egypt and with the international community to communicate our strong belief that a successful and orderly transition must be meaningful. Negotiations should include a broad representation of the Egyptian opposition, and this transition must address the legitimate grievances of those who seek a better future.
Third, we want to see this moment of turmoil turn into a moment of opportunity. The entire world is watching. What we hope for and what we will work for is a future where all of Egyptian society seizes that opportunity. Right now a great and ancient civilization is going through a time of tumult and transformation. And even as there are grave challenges and great uncertainty, I am confident that the Egyptian people can shape the future that they deserve. And as they do, they will continue to have a strong friend and partner in the United States of America.
Mr. Prime Minister.
Prime Minister Harper. Well, first of all, thank you, Barack. Both thank you for your friendship, both personal and national, and thank you for all the work you've done and all of your people have done to bring us to our announcement today.
[At this point, Prime Minister Harper spoke in French. He then provided an English translation of his remarks, as follows.]
And I will just repeat that.
Today President Obama and I are issuing a declaration on our border, but it is, of course, much more than that. It is a declaration on our relationship. Over the past nearly 200 years, our two countries have progressively developed the closest, warmest, most integrated, and most successful relationship in the world. We are partners, neighbors, allies, and most of all, we are true friends.
In an age of expanding opportunities, but also of grave dangers, we share fundamental interests and values just as we face common challenges and threats.
At the core of this friendship is the largest bilateral trading relationship in history. And since the signing of the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement, a milestone in the development of the modern era of globalization, that partnership has grown spectacularly.
Not only is the U.S. Canada's major export market, Canada is also America's largest export market: larger than China, larger than Mexico, larger than Japan, larger than all the countries of the European Union combined. Eight million jobs in the United States are supported by your trade with Canada. And Canada is the largest, the most secure, the most stable, and the friendliest supplier of that most vital of all America's purchases: energy.
It is in both our interests to ensure that our common border remains open and efficient, but it is just as critical that it remains secure and in the hands of the vigilant and the dedicated. Just as we must continually work to ensure that inertia and bureaucratic sclerosis do not impair the legitimate flow of people, goods, and services across our border, so too, we must up our game to counter those seeking new ways to harm us.
And I say ""us"" because as I have said before, a threat to the United States is a threat to Canada: to our trade, to our interests, to our values, to our common civilization. Canada has no friends among America's enemies, and America has no better friend than Canada.
The declaration President Obama and I are issuing today commits our governments to find new ways to exclude terrorists and criminals who pose a threat to our peoples. It also commits us to finding ways to eliminate regulatory barriers to cross-border trade and travel, because simpler rules lead to lower costs for business and consumers and ultimately to more jobs.
Shared information, joint planning, compatible procedures, and inspection technology will all be key tools. They make possible the effective risk management that will allow us to accelerate legitimate flows of people and goods between our countries while strengthening our physical security and economic competitiveness.
So we commit to expanding our management of the border to the concept of a North American perimeter, not to replace or eliminate the border, but, where possible, to streamline and decongest it.
There is much work to do. The declaration marks the start of this endeavor, not the end; an ambitious agenda between two countries, sovereign and able to act independently when we so choose, according to our own laws and aspirations, but always understanding this, that while a border defines two peoples, it need not divide them. That is the fundamental truth to which Canadians and Americans have borne witness for almost two centuries. And through our mutual devotion to freedom, democracy, and justice at home and abroad, it is the example we seek to demonstrate for all others.
President Obama. All right, we've got time for a couple of questions. I'm going to start with Alister Bull [Reuters].
Egypt/Energy
Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Is it conceivable to you that a genuine process of democratic reform can begin in Egypt while President Mubarak remains in power, or do you think his stepping aside is needed for reform even to begin?
And to Prime Minister Harper, on the energy issue, did you discuss Canada's role as a secure source of oil for the United States, and in particular, did you receive any assurances the U.S. administration looks favorably on TransCanada's proposed Keystone Pipeline to the Gulf Coast? Thank you.
President Obama. I have had two conversations with President Mubarak since this crisis in Egypt began, and each time I've emphasized the fact that the future of Egypt is going to be in the hands of Egyptians. It is not us who will determine that future. But I have also said that in light of what's happened over the last 2 weeks, going back to the old ways is not going to work. Suppression is not going to work. Engaging in violence is not going to work. Attempting to shut down information flows is not going to work.
In order for Egypt to have a bright future, which I believe it can have, the only thing that will work is moving a orderly transition process that begins right now, that engages all the parties, that leads to democratic practices, fair and free elections, a representative government that is responsive to the grievances of the Egyptian people.
Now, I believe that President Mubarak cares about his country. He is proud, but he's also a patriot. And what I've suggested to him is, is that he needs to consult with those who are around him in his Government. He needs to listen to what's being voiced by the Egyptian people and make a judgment about a pathway forward that is orderly, but that is meaningful and serious.
And I believe that--he's already said that he's not going to run for reelection. This is somebody who's been in power for a very long time in Egypt. Having made that psychological break, that decision that he will not be running again, I think the most important for him to ask himself, for the Egyptian Government to ask itself, as well as the opposition to ask itself, is how do we make that transition effective and lasting and legitimate.
And as I said before, that's not a decision ultimately the United States makes or any country outside of Egypt makes. What we can do, though, is affirm the core principles that are going to be involved in that transition. If you end up having just gestures towards the opposition, but it leads to a continuing suppression of the opposition, that's not going to work. If you have the pretense of reform, but not real reform, that's not going to be effective.
And as I said before, once the President himself announced that he was not going to be running again, and since his term is up relatively shortly, the key question he should be asking himself is: How do I leave a legacy behind in which Egypt is able to get through this transformative period? And my hope is, is that he will end up making the right decision.
Prime Minister Harper. You asked me about the question of energy, and yes, we did discuss the matter you raised. And let me just say this in that context. I think it is clear to anyone who understands this issue that the need of the United States for fossil fuels far in excess of its ability to produce such energy will be the reality for some time to come. And the choice that the United States faces in all of these matters is whether to increase its capacity, to accept such energy from the most secure, most stable, and friendliest location it can possibly get that energy, which is Canada, or from other places that are not as secure, stable, or friendly to the interests and values of the United States.
President Obama. I think we've got a Canadian reporter.
Canada-U.S. Relations/Border Security/Egypt
Q. Prime Minister, can you answer this in English and French? Canadians will be asking how much of our sovereignty and our privacy rights will be given up to have more open borders and an integrated economy. And while I have you on your feet, I want to ask you about Egypt as well, whether you feel that Mr. Mubarak should be stepping down sooner, it would help the transition?
And, Mr. President, on the sovereignty issue, you're welcome to answer it--you don't have to speak in French, though. [Laughter]
President Obama. Thank you. [Laughter] Now, I love French, but I'm just not very capable of speaking it. [Laughter]
Prime Minister Harper. On the question of sovereignty, this declaration is not about sovereignty. We are sovereign countries who have the capacity to act as we choose to act. The question that faces us is to make sure we act in a sovereign way that serves Canada's interests. It is in Canada's interests to work with our partners in the United States to ensure that our borders are secure and ensure that we can trade and travel across them as safely and as openly as possible within the context of our different laws.
And that is what we're trying to achieve here. We share security threats that are very similar on both sides of the border. We share an integrated economic space where it doesn't make sense to constantly check the same cargo over and over again. If we can do that at a perimeter, if we can decongest the border, that's what we should be doing. If we can harmonize regulations in ways that avoid unnecessary duplication and redtape for business, these are things that we need to do.
So that's what this is all about. This is about the safety of Canadians, and it is about creating jobs and economic growth for the Canadian economy.
Let me maybe--I'll do French, and then I'll come to Egypt.
[Prime Minister Harper provided a French translation of his remarks. He then continued in English, as follows.]
On the question of Egypt, let me just agree fully with what President Obama has said. I don't think there is any doubt from anyone who is watching the situation that transition is occurring and will occur in Egypt. The question is what kind of transition this will be and how it will lead. It is ultimately up to the Egyptian people to decide who will govern them.
What we want to be sure is that we lead towards a future that is not simply more democratic, but a future where that democracy is guided by such values as nonviolence, as the rule of law, as respect and respect for human rights, including the rights of minorities, including the rights of religious minorities.
[Prime Minister Harper provided a French translation of his remarks.]
President Obama. With respect to security issues and sovereignty issues, obviously, Canada and the United States are not going to match up perfectly on every measure with respect to how we balance security issues, privacy issues, openness issues. But we match up more than probably any country on Earth.
We have this border that benefits when it is open. The free flow of goods and services results in huge economic benefits for both sides. And so the goal here is to make sure that we are coordinating closely and that as we are taking steps and measures to ensure both openness and security, that we're doing so in ways that enhances the relationship as opposed to creates tensions in the relationship. And we are confident that we're going to be able to achieve that.
We've already made great progress just over the last several years on various specific issues. What we're trying to do now is to look at this in a more comprehensive fashion, so that it's not just border security issues, but it's a broader set of issues involved. And I have great confidence that Prime Minister Harper is going to be very protective of certain core values of Canada, just as I would be very protective of the core values of the United States, and those won't always match up perfectly.
And I thought--I agree even more with his answer in French. [Laughter]
All right. Thank you very much, everybody."
"March 03, 2011",The President's News Conference With President Felipe de Jesus Calderon Hinojosa of Mexico,Barack Obama,"Barack Obama, The President's News Conference With President Felipe de Jesus Calderon Hinojosa of Mexico Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/289801",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-felipe-de-jesus-calderon-hinojosa-mexico,"President Obama. Good afternoon. I am delighted to welcome my friend and partner, President Calderon, back to the White House. I want to discuss our meeting today and then address the situation in Libya.
President Calderon was last here, along with the First Lady, Senora Zavala, for a very productive state visit last spring, a visit that reflected the new era of respect and cooperation and partnership between our two countries. We've since worked together as global partners at the G-20 summits in Toronto and Seoul and at the APEC summit in Yokohama. And I very much appreciate President Calderon being here today to deepen the cooperation that is so essential to the prosperity and security of both of our countries.
Of course, the relationship between the United States and Mexico isn't measured just in the partnership between two Presidents. It's evident every day in the strong bonds between our two societies. It's the thousands of people who work together, at every level--Federal, State, and community levels--to keep our citizens safe, to keep our economies growing. It's the tens of thousands of students and teachers and researchers in exchanges between our schools and our universities.
It's the 1 million people who cross our shared border every day--tourists and businesspeople--sustaining one of the largest trading relationships in the world. And it's our families and our friends, the many Americans living in Mexico, and the tens of millions of Mexican Americans who make outstanding contributions to this country every single day.
As I said, we're also global partners. As part of the G-20, we're advancing the global economic recovery, and I look forward to visiting Mexico when President Calderon hosts the G-20 next year. Together, we've responded to the earthquake in Haiti, and we're securing the world's vulnerable nuclear materials. I especially want to commend President Calderon for Mexico's successful leadership of the Cancun conference, including progress towards a green fund that he himself helped to get started and champion and which will help developing countries adapt to climate change.
Most recently, our governments have spoken out forcefully for the human rights of the Libyan people, and Mexico played a leading role at the United Nations in suspending Libya from the Human Rights Council.
President Calderon, this not only reflects our commitment to the shared values of freedom and justice and rule of law. It's also another example of Mexico's global leadership, as you said in your address to our Congress last year, that ""Mexico is standing tall"" and ready to take its ""rightful place in the world.""
It is this appreciation of the great bonds between Americans and Mexicans and the values and responsibilities that we hold in common that allowed us to make progress once again today.
We're working to expand the trade that creates jobs for our peoples. Remember, Mexico is the second largest market for American exports. It supports some 1 million American jobs. And our exports to Mexico are growing faster than they are with the rest of the world.
So we're moving ahead with plans for a 21st-century border so people and goods can cross securely and efficiently. We're working to coordinate and streamline regulations and get rid of unnecessary trade barriers to make it easier to do business together. We're making new investments in clean energy partnerships, including green buildings and smart grid technologies. And based on negotiations so far, I'm hopeful that we can conclude an agreement by the end of the year to develop new sources of energy in the Gulf of Mexico.
I'm especially pleased to announce that, after nearly 20 years, we found--finally have found a clear path to resolving the dispute over trucking between our two countries. I thank President Calderon and his team, as well as my Transportation Secretary, Ray LaHood, and our U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Ron Kirk, for reaching this proposed agreement. I look forward to consulting with Congress and moving forward in a way that strengthens the safety of cross-border trucking, lifts tariffs on billions of dollars of U.S. goods, expands our exports to Mexico, and creates job on both sides of the border.
We're also deepening our cooperation against the drug cartels that threaten both our peoples. As I've said before, President Calderon and the Mexican people have shown extraordinary courage in the fight for their country. Tens of thousands of Mexicans--innocent citizens and dedicated security forces--have lost their lives. I have reaffirmed to President Calderon that in this cause, Mexico has a full partner with the United States. Because whether they live in Texas or Tijuana, our people have a right to be safe in their communities.
So we are continuing to speed up the delivery of equipment and training that our Mexican partners need to keep up this fight. As President Calderon cracks down on money laundering in Mexico, we're putting unprecedented pressure on cartels and their finances here in the United States. And we thank our Mexican partners for their close cooperation following the murder of one of our immigration and customs agents, Special Agent Jaime Zapata.
I reiterated that the United States accepts our shared responsibility for the drug violence. So to combat the southbound flow of guns and money, we are screening all southbound rail cargo, seizing many more guns bound for Mexico, and we are putting more gunrunners behind bars. And as part of our new drug control strategy, we are focused on reducing the demand for drugs through education, prevention, and treatment.
We have also discussed immigration, an issue on which both countries have responsibilities. As I told President Calderon, I remain deeply committed to fixing our broken immigration system with comprehensive reform that continues to secure our borders, enforces our laws, including against businesses that break the law, and requiring accountability from undocumented workers. And we have to conduct this debate in a way that upholds our values as a nation of both laws and immigrants. So I'm eager to work with Republicans and Democrats to get this reform done, which is vital to the U.S. economy.
Finally, I'm looking forward to receiving insights from the President as I prepare for my trip to Latin America this month, which will be an opportunity to strengthen our security cooperation throughout the region.
Mr. President, thank you for your partnership and for deepening the bonds between our countries, which only grow stronger each time that we meet.
Now, before I turn it over to President Calderon, I want to address the situation in Libya.
The United States, and the entire world, continues to be outraged by the appalling violence against the Libyan people. The United States is helping to lead an international effort to deter further violence, put in place unprecedented sanctions to hold the Qadhafi Government accountable, and support the aspirations of the Libyan people.
We are also responding quickly to the urgent humanitarian needs that are developing. Tens of thousands of people from many different countries are fleeing Libya, and we commend the governments of Tunisia and Egypt for their response, even as they go through their own political transitions. I have, therefore, approved the use of U.S. military aircraft to help move Egyptians who have fled to the Tunisian border to get back home to Egypt. I've authorized USAID to charter additional civilian aircraft to help people from other countries find their way home, and we're supporting the efforts of international organizations to evacuate people as well.
I've also directed USAID to send humanitarian assistance teams to the Libyan border so that they can work with the United Nations, NGOs, and other international partners inside Libya to address the urgent needs of the Libyan people.
Going forward, we will continue to send a clear message: The violence must stop. Muammar Qadhafi has lost the legitimacy to lead, and he must leave. Those who perpetrate violence against the Libyan people will be held accountable. And the aspirations of the Libyan people for freedom, democracy, and dignity must be met.
President Calderon.
President Calderon. Thank you very much, President Obama. Thank you so much for your hospitality. Ladies and gentlemen of the media, good afternoon.
President Barack Obama and I have held a very valuable conversation concerning the status of our bilateral cooperation and many aspects of this. As always, it has been very satisfying for me to see that we agree on the basic principle of coresponsibility. And I thank you, Mr. President, for your invitation to hold this working visit here in the city of Washington.
Some of the things that we evaluated is that our governments have progressed substantially on many of these aspects. The results of our cooperation in some aspects--unprecedented cooperation--have been translated into concrete examples, such as the opening last year in 2010 of the three first new border crossings over the past 10 years.
My state visit last year, as you mentioned, Mr. President, and the ongoing meetings that we have held and that we will continue to have in the immediate future have been especially important to our bilateral relationship so as to generate confidence--the confidence that we have today. We know today that we could--need to continue to be personally involved so as to ensure that the objectives that we trace are reached, such as those dealt with today. And we have broached the following subjects today.
First, internationally--at the international level, we have reiterated that Mexico and the United States are authentic, strategic partners, as can be seen by our joint work on the global and regional agendas. We have achieved substantive progress, as mentioned by President Obama, in matters such as climate change during the Conference of the Parties number 16. And now we have made efforts to make the agreements reached in Cancun operational and as well as to adopt the next steps for the Conference of the Parties number 17 in Durban.
Both countries will also play an important role within the G-20, a mechanism that Mexico will be presiding over next year and in which we have reached important agreements for stability and recovery of the international economy. And in this context I would like to congratulate President Obama for the visit that he will be making to Brazil, Chile, and El Salvador in a few weeks' time. Greater dialogue among the United States and Latin American nations will always be beneficial to the hemisphere and beneficial not just for Latin American countries, but also for the United States.
The specific case of Central America, in addition--here we've agreed to continue to work with the U.S. Government so as to achieve more determined cooperation in support of regional efforts to strengthen the rule of law and to fight transnational organized crime.
Secondly, in terms of the border, both President Obama and I agree that we must turn this era--area into the land of opportunities and not of conflict. Last year we adopted a declaration on the administration of a 21st-century border which we want both for the United States and Mexico. And since then, the bilateral executive committee entrusted with that implementation has agreed to a plan of action in addition to issuing a joint declaration to prevent border violence, so as to enable us to avoid tragic events such as those that we've seen on both sides of the border.
Thirdly, in terms of immigration, President Obama has always recognized--invariably recognized--the contributions of immigrants to the economy and society of the United States. And I recognition--recognize and value his clear and determined support for the adoption of a comprehensive migratory reform in this country, as well as his firm commitment to the human and civil rights of communities, regardless of their point of origin. I've expressed to him my concern for the proliferation of local initiatives that are against the interests or the rights of immigrant communities.
Fourth, in terms of competitiveness, Mexico has a regional perspective. The United States and Mexico can and must make the most of the comparative advantages that make us unique as a region and that would enable us to convert, to turn North America, in its entirety, into the most competitive region of the world. I am convinced that together we can achieve this.
The North American Free Trade Agreement was a great step forward for the commercial--trade integration of the region. It generated hundreds of thousands, even millions, of jobs in the United States and in Mexico. And we are ready to work to deepen and to make the most of this relationship.
We must work to efficiently--to take advantage of the relative abundance of capital in the United States with the labor manpower available in Mexico through productive actions, investments in our countries, as well as the access that is secure, orderly, and legal of national workers from Mexico in the U.S. market.
Our governments--something that is very important to us--have today reached an agreement, an agreement to solve our differences with respect to cross-border cargo trucking that had existed for many years. As I said, this has existed for a long time despite the fact that we had--that the integrated system for transportation existed and benefited both countries. It was strengthening our competitiveness and it generated jobs and it existed since 1994 when we agreed on the NAFTA.
In this sense, Mexico will be suspended on a--will be phasing out duty reprisals after noncompliance of the United States--of the free trade agreement of North America by the United States and will be ending--and as a result of this, will be furthering liberalization of cargo transportation. The objective of my Government has always been to reach a solution that's mutually acceptable in this field.
And fifth, in the chapter of security, both governments have taken on our positions as coresponsible parties in the fight against transnational organized crime. This is a paradigm change in our relationship. And today we have reached increased levels of exchange of information that are unheard of in the past. I would like to thank President Obama for the clarity with which he speaks of the effects that the consumption of drugs has on his country, as well as the illegal traffic of weapons and of monies into Mexican territory. I know that together we can achieve ever greater results.
Last year was the year where we had the greatest number of achievements in the capture of the number of criminals. Unprecedented number of criminals were caught, and this is the result of the increase of the institutional capacity of our agencies as well as international cooperation in terms of information and intelligence.
I also truly value the clear effort of the United States through transfer of equipment and training programs to our efforts--added to our efforts of institution--institutional efforts. And this I am sure will further our efforts tremendously. And I thank you for your support there, Mr. President. And I also am grateful for the clarity with which President Obama has recognized the great sacrifices that the Mexican society has had to make in view of organized crime and our fight of drug trafficking.
In the fight for the security of Mexico, thousands of military officers and members of the police force have died in Mexico. They fall in the line of duty. And to these deaths we add the death of Agent Jaime Zapata from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency of the United States. And I would like to add my deepest condolences to his relatives, to the people and Government of Mexico in view of his death--Government of the United States in view of his death.
I would like to tell you that the suspected perpetrator of his murder and his gang has been arrested, and we hope to bring them to justice. His death must urge us to continue to work together so as to ensure a prosperous and peaceful future for our region.
Ladies and gentlemen, today I'd like to say that I thank the hospitality of President Obama, and I would reiterate my trust, my confidence in the Government and institutions of this country. This country is a good friend to Mexico, as is President Obama. This opportunity represents for me a chance to strongly renew our efforts and to redouble our efforts to accomplish the security that our peoples deserve.
At the same time, I would like to congratulate President Obama for the leadership that he has shown in the problem of concern to all of us in North Africa, heading up the responsible efforts of the people and Government of the United States to quickly find solutions to this problem.
Mr. President, once again, thank you ever so much for your hospitality, the friendship that you have always shown to Mexico, the responsibility that your Government, your administration has unprecedently taken on in the subjects--the issues that are of common interest to us. Our bilateral relationship, my friends, does not only have a huge impact on the lives of Mexicans and Americans, but today it's taken on with increasing strength and clarity and coordination by both of our governments.
Once again, thank you for your personal commitment, the cooperation, and coresponsibility of your Government. We will continue to work together and harder to achieve the prosperity of both the Mexican and U.S. peoples. Thank you very much.
National Football League/Situation in Libya/Safety of U.S. Agents Working in Mexico
President Obama. I think we're going to take one question each. Ben Feller, AP [Associated Press].
Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have a question for both Presidents, and in your case, sir, I suppose it's a classic two-parter. [Laughter]
Audience member. With a follow-up.
President Obama. With a follow-up? So making it a three-parter? [Laughter]
Q. Thank you, sir. On Libya, I wanted to follow up on your comments. Colonel Qadhafi is vowing to fight to the end, and in the meantime, the people of his country are dying. Now, I know that you've admonished the press corps about impatience, and I know that the international community and the United States have taken several steps and you've named many of those today. But I'm wondering while this is happening, if you fear this is headed for a bloody stalemate. And more specifically, is a no-fly zone something that you're actively considering? And can you talk about what you see is your broader doctrine for military intervention in a crisis like this?
The other topic is something that is quite different but does matter to millions of Americans. The National Football League is on the brink of a complete shutdown as of tonight over a labor dispute. Obviously, that's an economic issue for cities, but also something that a lot of people just care about. And I'm wondering if it's something that you'd be willing to personally intervene on. And if not, why not?
President Calderon, sir, I was wondering your thoughts on an issue that's come up about potentially arming U.S. agents in Mexico; it's come up here in the U.S. Attorney General Holder has raised it as at least something that should be considered. I'm wondering if you will consider it, and if that came up with President Obama.
Thank you both.
President Obama. All right. Let me deal with football first. [Laughter] You've got owners, most of whom are worth close to a billion dollars. You got players who are making millions of dollars. My working assumption at a time when people are having to cut back, compromise, and worry about making the mortgage and paying for their kids' college education is, is that the two parties should be able to work it out without the President of the United States intervening.
I'm a big football fan, but I also think that for an industry that's making $9 billion a year in revenue, they can figure out how to divide it up in a sensible way and be true to their fans who are the ones who obviously allow for all the money that they're making. So my expectation and hope is, is that they will resolve it without me intervening, because it turns out I've got a lot of other stuff to do. [Laughter]
With respect to Libya, I think you asked about, sort of, do I have a doctrine. My approach throughout the convulsions that have swept through the Middle East is: number one, no violence against citizens; number two, that we stand for freedom and democracy. And in the situation in Libya, what you've seen is: number one, violence against citizens and the active urging of violence against unarmed citizens by Qadhafi; and number two, you have seen with great clarity that he has lost legitimacy with his people.
And so let me just be very unambiguous about this. Colonel Qadhafi needs to step down from power and leave. That is good for his country. That is good for his people. It's the right thing to do.
Those around him have to understand that violence that they perpetrate against innocent civilians will be monitored and they will be held accountable for it. And so to the extent that they are making calculations in their own minds about which way history is moving, they should know history is moving against Colonel Qadhafi and that their support for him and their willingness to carry out orders that are direct violence against citizens is something that ultimately they will be held accountable for.
With respect to our willingness to engage militarily, what I've instructed the Department of Defense, as well as our State Department and all those who are involved in international affairs, to examine is a full range of options. I don't want us hamstrung. I want us to be making our decisions based on what's going to be best for the Libyan people, in consultation with the international community.
And we are doing that not just here in the United States within our own agencies, but we're also doing it in consultation with NATO. We have already engineered the most rapid and forceful set of sanctions that have ever been applied internationally. We started unilaterally freezing $30 billion worth of assets, imposing severe sanctions against those in the Libyan Government who've been carrying out some of these crimes. And as a consequence of that leadership, what we've seen is, I think, broad-based mobilization around the international community.
You are right that there is a danger of a stalemate that over time could be bloody, and that is something that we are obviously considering. So what I want to make sure of is that the United States has full capacity to act potentially rapidly if the situation deteriorated in such a way that you had a humanitarian crisis on our hands or a situation in which civilians were--defenseless civilians were finding themselves trapped and in great danger.
I think it's very important for us to do this in consultation, though, with the international community. One of the extraordinary successes of Egypt was the full ownership that the Egyptian people felt for that transformation. That has served the Egyptian people well. It serves U.S. interests well. We did not see anti-American sentiment arising out of that movement in Egypt precisely because they felt that we hadn't tried to engineer or impose a particular outcome, but rather they owned it.
The same is happening in Tunisia. And I think that the region will be watching carefully to make sure we're on the right side of history, but also that we are doing so as a member of the world community and being willing to act on behalf of these values, but doing so in a way that takes all the various equities into account.
So just to put, sort of, the final point on it, we are looking at every option that's out there. In addition to the nonmilitary actions that we've taken, I want to make sure that those full range of options are available to me. Some of them may end up being humanitarian. I mean, the biggest priority that we have right now is you've got tens of thousand people--tens of thousands of people who are gathered at a border, and we've got to make sure that they can get home.
And that's why we--we're using some of our military aircrafts in addition to civilian aircrafts to help on that front. There may be situations in which Qadhafi is hunkered down in his compound, but the economy or food distribution systems in Tripoli, for example, start deteriorating, and we're going to have to figure out how do we potentially get food in there.
So there are a whole range of options, military and nonmilitary, that we're examining, and we'll be making these decisions based on what's best for the Libyan people and how can we make sure that we're minimizing the harm to innocent civilians during this process. Throughout all this, we will continue to send the clear message that it's time for Qadhafi to go.
Q. And a no-fly zone is one of those options still under consideration?
President Obama. That is one of the options that we would be looking at.
President Calderon. First, in terms of Libya, I recognize and applaud the efforts undertaken by President Obama, as I said previously, to seek a solution in line with international law for this situation. For Mexico, it's absolutely clear that we cannot--it's not possible that civilians be massacred and not go punished, using weapons that are for the exclusive use of war. We must do everything that we can to avoid or stop that massacre.
Mexico indeed has presented a resolution within the framework of the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations. And in this Libya has been sanctioned by the Commission. And we are of course taking part, insofar as we are able to, in the search for a solution to this problem.
I believe that today it is--problem to revalue the principles and the values of human rights anywhere in the world--the principles and values that we recognize and value. We have them in North American society and people, in terms of that we condemn any act of violence against people where people are risking their lives, in terms of the use of weapons.
We condemn any act of violence against these people, and we believe that people must have the best conditions to guarantee their work, including their personal security. And in this effort I know that we have the support of different agencies of the Government of the United States who have contributed enormously to the solution of the problems that we are facing together under the principle of shared responsibility that we are consolidating.
I must nonetheless clarify that there are very important legal restrictions in this matter in Mexico, as is probably the case in other countries, and most likely the United States, with respect to the actions of foreign agents in Mexican land. The law does not allow agents of the United States or of any other country to take part in tasks involving justice enforcement in our territory. As a result, they cannot carry weapons or undertake operational tasks. Their functions, in line with our treaties, are limited to the exchange of information and technical assistance to support Mexican authorities in these tasks. So there's an important legal restriction that exists.
But it's very clear for me as well that we must find the way of enhancing the level of protection of any and all agents who are acting within the framework of the law against crime. And of course, we are deeply analyzing alternatives for this and in dialogue with the Mexican Congress, who is the party that has the final word--the final say on this matter.
And finally, on the issue of football, I'm not an expert; my wife is, though. And I will ask her about it. I'm sure that she's very concerned about the situation. But allow me to say that football is very important for many Mexicans.
[At this point, President Calderon spoke in English.]
So for that, whatever you need, with the exception of money, you can count on us. [Laughter] But fix that, please.
President Obama. I will say that at the state dinner, the First Lady of Mexico seemed quite excited to see Mark Sanchez there. Yes. I don't know if that was of concern to you. [Laughter]
President Calderon. No. It's okay. Actually----
[President Calderon spoke in Spanish, and his remarks were translated be an interpreter.]
You've already thrown the coin--flipped the coin in a Jets game--Mrs. Zavala did.
[President Calderon called on a reporter, but the remarks were not translated.]
Mexico-U.S. Border Security and Drug Control Cooperation/Death of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agent Jaime Zapata
Q. Taking advantage of the moment and continuing the subject matter, I'm not going to ask many questions, but I will be very concrete. First, directly for President Obama, the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution allows American citizens to carry weapons, and this principle is defended. However, President Calderon has said that this law in Congress--that this could actually go against U.S. agents, and this has happened. So, President Obama, you--in Mexico we have the veto, the power of veto. I don't know how far you have the ability to veto that law that has been approved. And if you have that responsibility, why don't you do so, sir? How long are we going to allow Mexicans to be murdered--and not just Mexicans, but now Americans as well?
Now, with respect to the Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano has sent a bill or spoken to Congress with respect to the possibility of allowing U.S. agents to bear arms in our country. President Calderon has already answered this to a certain extent, but he's also said that he will be searching for mechanisms. What types of mechanisms can be found so as to keep them safe? And the people who murdered Zapata--well, in Mexican terms--Zapata, who was the alleged murderer of Zapata, the extradition of this man, of this alleged perpetrator has bee","n requested. Madam Napolitano has mentioned this. President Calderon, how far are you going to go in those efforts? And there you would have my questions.
President Obama. Well, the Second Amendment in this country is part of our Constitution, and the President of the United States is bound by our Constitution. So I believe in the Second Amendment. It does provide for Americans the right to bear arms for their protection, for their safety, for hunting, for a wide range of uses. That does not mean that we cannot constrain gunrunners from shipping guns into Mexico. And so we believe that we can shape an enforcement strategy that slows the flow of guns into Mexico, while at the same time preserving our Constitution.
You asked whether I have veto power over a particular bill. I think that the challenge that we have right now is not a particular bill, but rather that we are trying to work our way through more effective enforcement mechanisms to prevent straw purchasers from buying caches of weapons, transporting them across the border.
We've made progress on that front, given the authority and administrative power that we already possess. We have seen a significant increase in the number of weapons that have been confiscated. We have put more and more people behind bars for the transfer of weapons across the border into Mexico. We recognize that it's not enough and that we've got to do more.
Part of that job is to enforce the laws that are already on the books more effectively. Part of it may be to provide additional tools to law enforcement so that we can prevent the shipment of these weapons across the border.
But I do want to emphasize--and I emphasized this privately with President Calderon--we are very mindful that the battle President Calderon is fighting inside of Mexico is not just his battle; it's also ours. We have to take responsibility just as he's taking responsibility. And that's true with respect to guns flowing from north to south; it's true about cash flowing north to south. And so we've stepped up our enforcement and monitoring of bulk cash transfers across the borders that oftentimes finance these cartels.
So we're putting more and more resources into this. One of the things that I think that President Calderon and I have discussed is how we can strengthen border security on both sides, so that drugs flowing north or guns and cash flowing south, that we are able at all these points to intervene, interdict in a way that doesn't, on the other hand, slow the commerce and trade that is so important between our two countries.
It's a challenging task. We have a big border. We have a lot of people going back and forth. It's very important economically. But it is something that we have to continue to work on.
And I just want to say to all the people in the Mexican press that I have nothing but admiration for President Calderon and his willingness to take this on. The easy thing to do would be for him to ignore the corrosive, corrupting influence of these drug cartels within Mexico. That would be the easy thing to do. He's taking the hard path. And he's shown great courage and great risk in doing so.
And the United States will support him in any ways that we can in order to help him achieve his goals, because his goals are our goals as well. And they should be the goals of the Mexican people, because the notion that you would want these drug cartels to become more and more powerful and have greater and greater influence in the political life and the economic life and the cultural life of your country, I think, is something that nobody would want.
With respect to arming our agents, I think President Calderon was very clear. There are laws in place in Mexico that say that our agents should not be armed. The relationship that we have is as President Calderon described it: When it comes to our partnership, our cooperation in battling the drug cartels, our job is to help with information, it's to help with equipment, it's to help in coordination. We are in an advisory capacity; we do not carry out law enforcement activities inside of Mexico.
What we can do is to make sure that our cooperation is strengthened and deepened and becomes more effective over time. And we're constantly refining how we do that in a way that is respectful of Mexico's sovereignty. And obviously, I'm concerned about our own agents who are down there. And so I assure you that we will be examining all our procedures and protocols in terms of how our agents travel throughout Mexico. And we'll be working in close contact with Mexican law enforcement, who I'm sure will have important advice in terms of how we operate in that region.
But this cooperation has made great progress. We expect it to continue to make more progress in the future.
President Calderon. I'd like to thank President Obama for this wonderful support in terms of weapons. Others have made similar efforts before his administration in terms of deterring the flow of weapons to Mexico, but we know that what has to do with internal homeland security and the Attorney General are making important efforts and we know that even more weapons traffickers, gunrunners, have been caught than ever before.
There's a great deal that has to be improved in terms of how to share information, how to trace the weapons. And I also recognize, as I said, the efforts, knowing the large restrictions that President Obama and his administration have at a political level. They're making great efforts internally so that through administrative measures we can broach this matter.
One of the things that I suggested during our conversation--and I think we still have to look at this very carefully--is if we can find a means of sealing ports of entry along the border. As the President said and as I said, through the use of nonintrusive mechanisms for detection, we could assuredly have the safe and secure border that both nations want, that both peoples want. We all want to have a safe border. I believe it's possible, although it will require huge technological and financial resources to achieve it. But I think it's a way of ensuring security without affecting the Second Amendment rights of U.S. citizens, and at the same time stop the flow of drugs northbound, monies and guns southbound.
I would insist upon the legal restrictions that exist in Mexico as in other countries with respect to intervention and the bearing of arms by U.S. agents. But on this subject, I'll have to speak to Members of Congress, particularly the Senate, to explore different alternatives. And I think we have to look at all alternatives that are enabled to us by the Constitution and the law, mechanisms of protection--special mechanisms of protection, clear delineation of the areas where we can collaborate, for instance.
The criminals themselves, they tell us that they didn't know that they were attacking U.S. agents in their attack, so it's not that that's what they wanted to do. But I think at any rate this is still a very important sign--a warning sign to all of us where we have to be--indicating that we have to be very careful about how we care for all of our agents--not just Mexican, American--all agents. We have to have a specific policy that's much more daring in this sense.
And I think that here, not just in terms of weapons, guns, we have to think in a much more open manner and seek much more creative solutions. It seems to me that we are experiencing extraordinary circumstances that call for extraordinary actions by our governments.
Now, with respect to the extradition of this criminal, it's something that we hadn't really discussed. I don't know if President Obama wanted to discuss this. We still have not finished our meetings yet. But--although we have to review what the law stipulates in terms of the extradition for each case of it, I'm, in truth, very convinced that these cases have to be brought to trial. There is the political will, full political will, that this individual be brought to justice with the full weight of the law, whether that be in the United States or in Mexico, if the law allows it. In terms of a request for extradition, I'd have to reserve my opinion in this sense because it will depend on what the law stipulates in this sense. Of course, there is a political will to cooperate in this matter as well as on many others.
President Obama. I didn't comment on the extradition issue. Let me just emphasize [that]* we have made a request for extradition [intend to seek the extradition of those involved].* I think beyond that it's probably not appropriate to comment. Okay? But we expect the full weight of the law to be brought against this perpetrator.
Thank you very much, everybody."
"March 11, 2011",The President's News Conference,Barack Obama,"Barack Obama, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/292578",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1112,"The President. Good morning, everybody. Before I begin, I want to say a few words about the terrible earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan earlier today.
First and foremost, our thoughts and our prayers are with the people of Japan. This is a potentially catastrophic disaster and the images of destruction and flooding coming out of Japan are simply heartbreaking. Japan is, of course, one of our strongest and closest allies, and this morning I spoke with Prime Minister Kan. On behalf of the American people, I conveyed our deepest condolences, especially to the victims and their families, and I offered our Japanese friends whatever assistance is needed.
We currently have an aircraft carrier in Japan, and another is on its way. We also have a ship en route to the Marianas Islands to assist as needed. The Defense Department is working to account for all our military personnel in Japan. U.S. Embassy personnel in Tokyo have moved to an offsite location. And the State Department is working to account for and assist any and all American citizens who are in the country.
Tsunami warnings have been issued across the Pacific, and we've already seen initial waves from the tsunami come ashore on Guam and other U.S. Territories, in Alaska and Hawaii, as well as on--along the West Coast. Here in the United States, there hasn't been any major damage so far. But we're taking this very seriously, and we are monitoring the situation very closely. FEMA is fully activated and is coordinating with State and local officials to support these regions as necessary. And let me just stress that if people are told to evacuate, do as you are told.
Today's events remind us of just how fragile life can be. Our hearts go out to our friends in Japan and across the region, and we're going to stand with them as they recover and rebuild from this tragedy.
Now, before I take a few questions, let me say a few words about something that's obviously been on the minds of many Americans here at home, and that's the price of gasoline.
In an economy that relies on oil, gas prices affect everybody, from farmers and truck drivers to restaurant owners and workers, as well as consumers. Businesses see rising prices affect their bottom line. Families feel the pinch every time they fill up the tank. For Americans already facing tough times, it's an added burden.
Of course, rising prices are not a new phenomenon. Three years ago, before the recession hit, a combination of factors, including rising demand from emerging economies like China, drove gas prices to more than $4 a gallon. The worldwide recession and the decrease in demand pushed prices back down. But over the past year, as the economy has picked up steam and global demand for oil has increased, prices have increased again. Turmoil in North Africa and the Middle East has added uncertainty to the mix, and lost production in Libya has tightened supply.
Now, here's the good news. The global community can manage supply disruptions like this. Other oil-producing nations have committed to filling any gaps, and we will continue to coordinate closely with our international partners to keep all options on the table when it comes to any supply disruptions.
Here at home, everybody should know that should the situation demand it, we are prepared to tap the significant stockpile of oil that we have in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We're also using the resources at our disposal at the Federal level to monitor any possible manipulation in the oil markets. And I'm asking the Attorney General and relevant State--relevant agencies to work with States' attorneys general to monitor for price gouging to make sure that nobody is taking advantage of working families at the pump.
In addition, America is better prepared for supply disruptions than we used to be. Today, we use 7 percent less oil than we did in 2005, even as our economy has grown since then, partly because our economy as a whole is more efficient. We're adapting. We're producing more oil, and we're importing less. Our automakers, for example, are manufacturing more fuel-efficient cars, some that now get more than 50 miles to the gallon, and our consumers are driving more of these cars.
In December, Democrats and Republicans came together to pass a payroll tax cut that is already helping to grow our economy and create jobs. In the wake of rising gas prices, it should also help act as a cushion for working families. This doesn't lessen our commitment to do everything that we can to get gas prices down, but that tax cut will total about $1,000 for the average working family this year, or an extra $80 or so showing up in your paycheck each month. And that tax relief package is a key reason that even with these higher prices, economists and investors like Warren Buffett believe we should still expect solid growth and strong private sector job creation this year.
Now, the hard truth is, is that as long as our economy depends on foreign oil, we'll always be subject to price spikes. So we've got to get moving on a comprehensive energy strategy that pursues both more energy production and more energy conservation. We need to increase our access to secure energy supplies in the near term, and we've got to make our economy more energy efficient and energy independent over the long run.
Let me be more specific. First, we need to continue to boost domestic production of oil and gas. Last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003. Let me repeat that. Our oil production reached its highest level in 7 years. Oil production from Federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico reached an alltime high. For the first time in more than a decade, imports accounted for less than half of what we consumed.
So any notion that my administration has shut down oil production might make for a good political sound bite, but it doesn't match up with reality. We are encouraging offshore exploration and production. We're just doing it responsibly. I don't think anybody has forgotten that we're only a few months removed from the worst oil spill in our history. So what we've done is to put in place commonsense standards like proving that companies can actually contain an underwater spill. And oil companies are stepping up. We've approved more than 35 new offshore drilling permits that meet these new safety and environmental standards.
There is more we can do, however. For example, right now the industry holds leases on tens of millions of acres, both offshore and on land, where they aren't producing a thing. So I've directed the Interior Department to determine just how many of these leases are going undeveloped and report back to me within 2 weeks so that we can encourage companies to develop the leases they hold and produce American energy. People deserve to know that the energy they depend on is being developed in a timely manner.
We're also taking steps that will enable us to gather data on potential gas and oil resources off the mid- and south Atlantic, and we're working with the industry to explore new frontiers of production, safety measures, and containment technology. We're looking at potential new development in Alaska, both onshore and offshore. And when it comes to imported oil, we're strengthening our key energy relationships with other producer nations, something that I will discuss with President Rousseff when I visit Brazil next week.
All these actions can increase domestic oil production in the short and medium term. But let's be clear: It is not a long-term solution. Even if we started drilling new wells tomorrow, that oil isn't coming on line overnight. And even if we tap every single reserve available to us, we can't escape the fact that we only control 2 percent of the world's oil, but we consume over a quarter of the world's oil. T. Boone Pickens, who made his fortune in the oil business--and I don't think anybody would consider him unfriendly to drilling--was right when he said that ""this is one emergency we can't drill our way out of.""
We can't place our long-term bets on a finite resource that we only control 2 percent of, especially a resource that's vulnerable to hurricanes, war, and political turmoil. So beyond increased domestic production, if we want to secure our long-term prosperity and protect the American people from more severe oil shocks in the future, the way to do it is to gradually reduce demand and then do everything we can to break our dependence on oil.
For example, last year, we established a groundbreaking national fuel efficiency standard for cars and trucks. It's going to save consumers money while conserving about 1.8 billion barrels of oil. And we're working with automakers, autoworkers, and States to ensure that the high-quality, fuel-efficient cars and trucks of tomorrow continue to be built right here in the United States of America.
To satisfy our broader energy needs, we're working to diversify our entire portfolio with historic investments in clean energy. Right now, all across America, our farmers are producing homegrown fuels, our scientists are looking for the next breakthroughs, and our workers are back in once-shuttered factories, manufacturing wind turbines and solar panels and advanced batteries that will help our cars get hundreds of miles to the gallon. These are jobs that didn't exist 2 years ago, and we want to create millions more of these jobs.
And in this state--this year's State of the Union Address, I set a goal for America: By 2035, 80 percent of our electricity will come from a broad array of clean energy sources, from renewables like wind and solar and homegrown biofuels, along with natural gas, clean coal, and nuclear power.
So these are just some of the steps that we've already taken to secure America's energy future. And over the course of the weeks and months ahead, we will take more. But the bottom line is this: We've been having this conversation for nearly four decades now. Every few years, gas prices go up, politicians pull out the same old political playbook, and then nothing changes. And when prices go back down, we slip back into a trance. And then when prices go up, suddenly, we're shocked. I think the American people are tired of that. I think they're tired of talk. We've got to work together, Democrats, Republicans, and everybody in between, to finally secure America's energy future. I don't want to leave this for the next President, and none of us should want to leave it for our kids.
So with that, let me take a few questions. And I'm going to start with Mr. Todd [Chuck Todd, NBC News].
Situation in Libya
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to go to--start with Libya. You had said that you want to see Qadhafi leave power, leave office. Are you prepared to use any means necessary in the United States Government to make that happen? And if not, why not? I know in the cases of some of these other uprisings there's been a careful consideration not to take sides, let the Libyan--let the people in those countries make this decision. But in this case, it does seem we have taken sides. So what--what's the red line here?
The President. Well, first of all, let's take a look at what we've already done. My first priority obviously was getting out American citizens and Embassy personnel out of Libya, and we got that done. The very next day, we had already instituted the largest financial seizure of assets in our history. And the day after that, we'd imposed sanctions and we had mobilized the international community through the United Nations so that across the board we are slowly tightening the noose on Qadhafi. He is more and more isolated internationally, both through sanctions as well as an arms embargo.
In addition to that, we've provided a host of humanitarian aid measures to make sure that people are not adversely affected as they cross the borders into Tunisia or Egypt. And we will continue to do that.
And what we've done is we've organized in NATO a series of conversations about a wide range of options that we can take, everything from 24-hour surveillance so that we can monitor the situation on the ground and react rapidly if conditions deteriorated, to further efforts with respect to an arms embargo, additional efforts on humanitarian aid, but also potential military options including a no-fly zone.
NATO will be meeting on Tuesday to consider a no-fly zone, and we've been in discussions with both Arab countries as well as African countries to gauge their support for such an action.
In addition, Secretary Hillary Clinton will be meeting with the opposition in the next several days, and we have determined that it's appropriate for us to assign a representative whose specific job is to interact with the opposition and determine ways that we can further help them. And so we're going to be in close consultation with them.
So the bottom line is, is that I have not taken any options off the table at this point. I think it is important to understand that we have moved about as swiftly as an international coalition has ever moved to impose sanctions on Qadhafi. I am absolutely clear that it is in the interest of the United States and, more importantly, in the interest of the Libyan people for Mr. Qadhafi to leave. And I have not foreclosed these options.
Now, I do take very seriously making sure that any decisions I make that involve U.S. military power are well thought through and are done in close consultation with Secretary Gates, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mullen, and all relevant personnel. Any time I send the United States forces into a potentially hostile situation, there are risks involved and there are consequences. And it is my job as President to make sure that we have considered all those risks.
It's also important, from a political perspective, to, as much as possible, maintain the strong international coalition that we have right now.
Q. Are you concerned that because you've called for his removal, you've imposed all these sanctions, that Qadhafi feels cornered, has no other option in his mind but to just keep fighting, keep fighting? And in the words of your Director of National Intelligence, he may have the firepower to potentially win this standoff with the rebels.
The President. I am concerned, absolutely. And I think that's why it's so important for us not to stop where we are, but to continue to find options that will add additional pressure, including sending a clear message to those around Qadhafi that the world is watching and we're paying attention and that there have been referrals to the International Criminal Court.
Part of what we're going to be wanting to do is to change the balance not just militarily inside of Libya, but also to change the balance in terms of those who are around Qadhafi and are thinking about what their future prospects are if they continue down the course that they're on.
But, Chuck, there's no doubt that I am concerned about it. Qadhafi has a stash of weapons. He not only has some troops that remain loyal to him, but there have been reports that he's also been hiring mercenaries. Even with the financial freeze that we've imposed, he still has some assets. The rebel groups are just now getting organized. And so we're going to have to continue to apply pressure, and that's why I say we have not taken any options off the table at this point.

Situation in Libya/Federal Budget
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Just to follow up on Libya, and I also have a budget question. You say you're concerned, but is Qadhafi staying, is that an acceptable option for you ever?
And my question on the budget is: There's been some criticism from members of your own party about your leadership on negotiations on spending. And I'm wondering, given that, if you can talk about where you stand on a 3-week CR, on longer-term priorities, and what you would and would not accept on cuts.
The President. Sure.
Q. Thank you.
The President. Going back to the Qadhafi question, as I said before, it is in the United States interest and the interest of the people of Libya that Qadhafi leave. And we are going to do a wide--we're going to take a wide range of actions to try to bring about that outcome. When you say is it ever acceptable, I mean, I think what you're asking is, are we going to do--engage in any potential military action to make that happen. And as I've said before, when it comes to U.S. military actions, whether it's a no-fly zone or other options, you've got to balance costs versus benefits. And I don't take those decisions lightly.
But let me be as clear as I can about the desired outcome from our perspective, and that is that Qadhafi step down. And we are going to continue to work with the international community to try to achieve that, and we are going to be in close consultation with these opposition groups as they get organized to see how we can bring about that outcome.
Now, with respect to the budget, I think it's important to understand that right now the discussion is about last year's business. We're talking about how to fund the remainder of this fiscal year. This is an appropriations task. And we have been in very close contact with all Members of Congress, both parties. I've had conversations with Mr. McConnell, I've had conversations with Mr. Boehner, I've had conversations with Nancy Pelosi, and I've had conversations with Harry Reid about how they should approach this budget problem.
Here's what we know: The Republicans in the House passed a budget that has been now rejected in the Senate. They are not going to get 100 percent of what they want. The Democrats have put forward spending cuts, many of them pretty painful, that give Republicans already half of what they were seeking, because they're the right thing to do. Many of those cuts are ones that were already embodied in the budget that I proposed for 2012. Now, that's been rejected as well.
So here's what we know: that both sides are going to have to sit down and compromise on prudent cuts somewhere between what the Republicans were seeking that's now been rejected and what the Democrats had agreed to that has also been rejected. It shouldn't be that complicated. And so what I've done is, every day I talk to my team, I give them instructions in terms of how they can participate in the negotiations, indicate what's acceptable, indicate what's not acceptable. And our expectation is, is that we should be able to get this completed.
Now, because, I think, neither Democrats or Republicans were in the mood to compromise until their 100-percent maximal position was voted down in the Senate, we've probably lost some time. And we may not be able to fully resolve this and meet next week's deadline for the continuing resolution, which means that there may be potentially one more short-term extension.
But let me just make some broad points about this. Number one, we can't keep on running the Government based on 2-week extensions. That's irresponsible. I mean, I--we've got a war in Afghanistan going on. We've got a wide range of issues facing the country on a day-to-day basis. And the notion that we can't get resolved last year's budget in a sensible way with serious but prudent spending cuts I think defies common sense. So we should be able to get it done.
Point number two: There are going to be certain things that House Republicans want that I will not accept. And the reason I won't accept them is not because I don't think we've got to cut the budget; we do. And we've already put forward significant cuts in the discretionary budget, some of which have not made members of my own party happy.
But the notion that we would cut, for example, Pell grants, when we know the single most important thing to our success as a nation long term is how well-educated our kids are, and the proposal that was coming out of the House would cut this year about $800 out of Pell grants for 8 million kids and, if were extended into next year, would cut in half the Pell grants that they're receiving, that makes no sense. The notion that we would decide that, under the Republican budget proposal, to eliminate 200,000 Head Start slots that also would mean the layoffs of 55,000 teachers, that doesn't make sense.
The principle that I've tried to put forward since the State of the Union is we've got to live within our means, we've got to get serious about managing our budget, but we can't stop investing in our people. We can't stop investing in research and development. We can't stop investing in infrastructure, those things that are going to make us competitive over the long term and will help us win the future.
And so I've communicated directly to Speaker Boehner as well as to Republican Leader McConnell that we want to work with them to get to a sustainable discretionary budget. And we think it is important for us to stop funding programs that don't work. But we're going to make sure that we hold the line when it comes to some critical programs that are either going to help us outeducate, outinnovate, or outbuild other countries.
Last point I'll make on the budget: The Republican budget that passed out of the House included a whole range of what are called riders. These aren't really budget items. These are political statements. And I want--I've said, again, directly to Speaker Boehner that we're happy to discuss any of these riders, but my general view is, let's not try to sneak political agendas into a budget debate. If Republicans are interested in social issues that they want to promote, they should put a bill on the floor of the House and promote it, have an up-or-down vote, send it over to the Senate. But don't try to use the budget as a way to promote a political or ideological agenda.
I think that's the American people's view as well. I think one of the messages that the American people have clearly sent is: Get serious about living within our means and managing our budget in a responsible way, and stop with the political bickering. And if we have that view in mind, then I think that not only can we get this short-term issue resolved, but I think we can actually solve the long-term budget issues as well.

Situation in Japan/Detention of Army Private First Class Bradley E. Manning
Q. Thanks, Mr. President. Experts say they can't recall a time when the U.S. ever had to rush assistance to a nuclear power plant in another country before. What can you tell us about how serious this is with the U.S. rushing coolant to Japan because of the nuclear plant there?
And then, a second question. The State Department spokesman, P.J. Crowley, said the treatment of Bradley Manning by the Pentagon is ""ridiculous and counterproductive and stupid."" And I'm wondering if you agree with that. Thank you, sir.
The President. On point number one, when I spoke to Prime Minister Kan, I specifically asked him about the nuclear plants and their potential vulnerability as a consequence of the earthquake. He indicated that they are monitoring the situation very closely. So far, they have not seen evidence of radiation leaks. But obviously, you've got to take all potential precautions. And I've asked Steve Chu, our Energy Secretary, to be in close contact with their personnel to provide any assistance that's necessary, but also to make sure that if, in fact, there have been breaches in the safety system on these nuclear plants, that they're dealt with right away.
With respect to Private Manning, I have actually asked the Pentagon whether or not the procedures that have been taken in terms of his confinement are appropriate and are meeting our basic standards. They assure me that they are. I can't go into details about some of their concerns, but some of this has to do with Private Manning's safety as well.
Q. Do you disagree with P.J. Crowley?
The President. I think I gave you an answer to the substantive issue.
Q. One more quick question: On the coolant, how did that happen? Why was it----
The President. I don't yet have all the details, Jake. So I'm going to have to defer that question until we get more. Obviously, the tragedy just happened a few hours ago, and there's going to be a lot of fact-finding that we're going to have to determine.
Chip Reid [CBS News].
Situation in Libya
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to go at the Libya thing in a slightly different way. In an interview with CBS News, Qadhafi's son Saif said the plan is ""to squash the rebels with no mercy."" If he follows through, if the Qadhafi regime follows through on that, can the United States simply stand by and do nothing? And I say that in light of the fact that in the past you have said there are times when a brutal government is massacring its own citizens that the United States has a moral obligation to intervene militarily.
The President. I continue to believe that not only the United States, but the international community has an obligation to do what it can to prevent a repeat of something like what occurred in the Balkans in the nineties, what occurred in Rwanda. And so part of, for example, maintaining 24-hour surveillance of the situation there is for us to have some sort of alert system if you start seeing defenseless civilians who were being massacred by Qadhafi's forces.
But obviously, we're going to have to look at what develops on the ground on a case-by-case basis. I don't want to generalize right now and say that's what's happening and we're prepared to step in. It's going to require some judgment calls, and those are difficult ones. But we have sent a clear warning to the Qadhafi Government that they will be held accountable, particularly when it comes to assaulting civilians. And some of the rhetoric that you've seen--for example, the idea that when Qadhafi said that they'd be going door to door hunting for people who are participating in protests--that implied a sort of lack of restraint and ruthlessness that, I think, raises our antenna.
But as I said before, what I've got to do is make sure that we're monitoring the situation and matching our actions with what we think will be helpful on the ground and also sustainable, and we've got to do so in consultation with the international community.
Q. Quick follow-up: Can I ask you, do you agree with your top intelligence official, James Clapper, who said before Congress yesterday that it is likely that the Qadhafi regime will prevail in the long run? And did he err by saying that in public? And if so, is this something he needs to be taken to the woodshed for?
The President. He was making a hardheaded assessment about military capability. And I don't think anybody disputes that Qadhafi has more firepower than the opposition. He wasn't stating policy.
So let me be clear again about what our policy as determined by me, the President of the United States, is towards the situation there. I believe that Qadhafi is on the wrong side of history. I believe that the Libyan people are anxious for freedom and the removal of somebody who has suppressed them for decades now. And we are going to be in contact with the opposition, as well as in consultation with the international community, to try to achieve the goal of Mr. Qadhafi being removed from power.
Zachary Goldfarb [Washington Post].
Strategic Petroleum Reserve/Oil Supply/National Economy/Housing Market
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You talked about the option of tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Can you walk through which steps or which targets have to be hit before we do that--oil price, gas price--and how much would you want to release in any particular moment? And secondly, can you talk about, in addition to energy shocks, what are the other two or three gravest threats to the economic recovery and what your administration is doing about it?
The President. The answer to your first question is, no, I will not go through the prices that would trigger the release of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. But what I can do is to give you a sense of how, historically, it's been understood.
The idea behind the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is, if there was a severe disruption in supply--similar to what happened in the seventies, for example, when you had the OPEC making a decision not to sell for a while--how would our economy continue to function, and making sure that we've got sufficient supplies for that. Another example would be during Hurricane Katrina, when you've got a whole bunch of refineries that have been impacted and production in the Gulf has been impacted. That's another example where in a short term you can fill that hole.
Right now what we're seeing is not a shortage of supply; refineries are actually operating at fairly full capacity at the moment. The problem is, is a great deal of uncertainty in the oil markets, part of it prompted by the fact that the economy is growing faster in some places than others, but you've got China and India and Brazil and other emerging nations that are using more and more energy as their economies advance.
We already saw that trend in 2008. Because of the worldwide recession, oil prices went back down. But to some degree, a lot of what's happening in prices is as a consequence of economic growth and countries and economies starting to use more oil.
Part of it, though, is also uncertainty in terms of what's happening in the Middle East. And so one of the messages that I've--I want to send today is that we are confident about our ability to fill any potential gaps in supply. Libya, for example, does not account for a large portion of overall world production. They provide a type of oil that is highly valued, and there's a high premium on it, but basically, even if Libyan oil production was suspended for a significant period of time because of the unrest there, we'd be able to fill that gap.
So a lot of this has to do with uncertainty in the market. And part of what I want to com","municate to the market is, is that we're going to do what we need to do, in consultation with both other producer nations as well as in consultation with our allies who also have reserves, to make sure that oil supplies remain stable and that economic growth is going to continue.
I do want to repeat the point that I've made, though, that, look, the American people feel this pretty acutely. Right? I mean, we can talk all we want in the abstract about world oil markets; what they're concerned about is, this is money out of my pocket. Some of the steps that we've already taken are making a difference. But obviously, if you are in a house that requires you to commute 50 miles every day to your job, you're not going to be able to sell your house immediately, particularly in this market, and move closer. You may want to buy a fuel-efficient car, but you may not be able to afford it. And so you're stuck with the old clunker that's getting 8 or 10 miles a gallon.
And so--and in fact, a lot of folks who are having the toughest time, who are either unemployed or have low-wage jobs, they're the ones that are most severely affected because they're using a higher portion of their income just to fill up the gas tank.
So we're going to try to do everything we can not only to stabilize the market; as I said, to the extent that we see any efforts to take advantage of these price spikes through price gouging, we're going to go after that. If we see significant disruptions or shifts in the market that are so disconcerting to people that we think a Strategic Petroleum Reserve release might be appropriate, then we'll take that step. And we're going to monitor very closely. And obviously, we have it teed up, so this isn't a situation where it would take a big bureaucracy and several weeks for us to implement. This is something that would take several days.
With respect to the overall economy, I think my assessment and the assessment of most economists is that, although gas prices are hurting individuals right now and obviously taking some of that tax cut that we gave them and forcing them to use it on gas as opposed to buying other items, that, in part because of the steps we took, both Democrats and Republicans, during the lame duck session, that the economic growth continues in a positive trend.
We saw that in the jobs report, which in the private sector at least, was better than expected. We've seen the unemployment rate drop a full point. And so, overall, I'm positive about the fact that we're moving slowly but surely into positive job growth over the next several months.
There are some areas we're still concerned about. Housing is one that I just mentioned. We've got a lot of folks who, because housing prices have fallen so steeply, are still hurting. Some of them are threatened with foreclosure, maybe because they lost a job. In some cases, they want to sell their house so they can move to a new job, and their house is underwater; essentially, their mortgage is higher than what the house would sell for right now.
We have a number of steps to encourage loan modifications, to encourage banks to take steps that would alleviate some of that burden and start clearing some of those homes on the market, but it's a slow process. It's a five--you're talking about $5 trillion worth of product out there. And I mentioned that I had this conversation with Warren Buffett a couple weeks ago when I was giving him the Medal of Freedom, and his point was, look, I'm bullish about this economy; when it comes to the housing market, it just takes some time to work itself out because we had such a housing bubble. We had so much construction, particularly in certain States that are harder hit than others. That was then compounded by the overall recession. And it's going to take some time for the housing market to improve. But we're continuing to take a range of steps to try to strengthen that process of recovery in the housing market.
The last point I'll make on the economy overall relates back to the budget issues that we talked about. If you looked at the last jobs report, growth in the private sector--very strong, 220,000 jobs created. Where you lost jobs was in State and local government. And that means teachers being laid off, firefighters being laid off, police officers being laid off. Now, we were able to cushion some of that over the first 2 years of this recession through the Recovery Act, and it made a huge difference all across the country. But now States are continuing to cut; local governments are continuing to cut.
I think it's very important, when we think about the budget, to understand that our long-term debt and deficits are not caused by us having Head Start teachers in the classroom. Our long-term debt and deficit are caused primarily by escalating health care costs that we see in Medicare and Medicaid that is putting huge pressure on the overall budget.
And that's why I think it's going to be important for us to have a conversation after we get the short-term budget done about how do we really tackle the problem in a comprehensive way. And that means not just going after Head Start or Corporation for Public Broadcasting; that's not where the money is. What it means is, is that we've got to make sure that we're tackling defense spending, we're tackling tax expenditures and tax loopholes, that we're tackling entitlements, and that we're thinking about how do we really get our arms around those things that are driving the debt and deficit, in a serious way and in a bipartisan way.
I'll make this the last question. Hisham Bourar [Alhurra TV].
Situation in the Middle East
Q. Thank you, Mr. President----
The President. Why don't you get a microphone so we can hear you?
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Did you have contacts with other leaders in the Middle East? And when you appraised them for reforms, are you looking at other options where other leaders in the region can be supported to stay in power in the Middle East?
The President. I'm in constant contact with leaders throughout the Middle East, and I've had a fairly consistent message to all of them: Number one, the United States believes in the right of peaceful protests and the ability of ordinary people to express their grievances to their government. And we oppose the use of violence in response to peaceful protests. So that's one clear message that we tried to send.
The second message we've try to send is that it is in the interest of the entire region to reform itself: to reform itself both politically and economically so that the incredible talents of young people throughout that region can be tapped; so that the young man, whether he is in Sanaa or he's in Tripoli or she's in Cairo or Amman, that they know that if they work hard, if they are getting an education, that they have an opportunity to live a better life, that they can get a job that pays a good wage and supports their family, and that they can have the basic necessities of life, and that they have personal security and they have personal freedom.
Now, each country is different, and so the evolution, the process towards that vision is going to differ in each country. But my consistent message to leaders in the region is that this process of change can be a great opportunity for the Middle East, because if you can tap into the talents of those young people, then you can start seeing the kind of economic growth in that region that you've started to see in other places in the world.
And there's no reason why countries in the Middle East shouldn't have the same kind of growth rates that you're seeing in China and India. There's nothing inherent about the people in those countries that would prevent that. What's preventing it is the fact that for many decades you've seen a lack of opening up that allows you to take advantage of the global economy.
And I think that, as I said, each country is going to be different, and it's going to ultimately be up to the people in those countries to determine the best form for them to seize this opportunity, but we should be on the side of those who want to seize this opportunity.
Okay?
Q. Japanese press--Mr. President, from the Japanese media?
The President. From the Japanese media, because of--because obviously, we're concerned about what's happening in Japan.
Situation in Japan
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm Toshi Ogata with Asahi Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper. I have two questions on the tragedy in Japan. So you already touched on the issue in your opening statement. I'd like to ask about your personal feeling on the situation. You went to Japan last year; you went to Kamakura. Now a tsunami hit the coast of Japan, and waves washed away cars and houses, and Japanese people are devastated. I just want to ask about your personal thoughts and feelings on that.
And secondly, you also touched on the possibility of assistance from the United States to Japan. And the Japanese Government publicly said that Japan asked for help from U.S. forces in Japan. Are you waiting to provide those assistance?
The President. The answer to your second question is yes. And so I already told Prime Minister Kan that we will provide whatever assistance that they need. My understanding is that the main assistance that we're going to be able to provide them is lift capacity, the ability for us to, I think, help in the cleanup.
Obviously, when you have a tsunami like this as well as an earthquake, you have huge disruptions both in the infrastructure; you have boats and houses and cars that are washed into main thoroughfares, and that requires heavy equipment. And so any assistance that we can provide, we will be providing.
I'm heartbroken by this tragedy. I think when you see what's happening in Japan, you are reminded that for all our differences in culture or language or religion, that ultimately, humanity is one. And when we face these kinds of natural disasters, whether it's in New Zealand or Haiti or Japan, then you think about your own family, and you think how would you feel if you lost a loved one, or if your entire lifesavings were gone because of the devastation.
And the Japanese people are such close friends of ours, and I have such a close personal friendship and connection to the Japanese people--in part because I grew up in Hawaii, where I was very familiar with Japanese culture--that that just makes our concerns that much more acute.
But I am very confident, though, obviously, that the Japanese people are so resourceful, Japan is such a powerful economy and such an advanced economy technologically, that Japan will successfully rebuild. And it has experience dealing with natural disasters. It has dealt with them before and will deal with them again. And Japan, I'm sure, will come back stronger than ever, hopefully, with our help. All right?
Thank you very much, everybody."
"March 22, 2011","The President's News Conference With President Carlos Mauricio Funes Cartagena of El Salvador in San Salvador, El Salvador",Barack Obama,"Barack Obama, The President's News Conference With President Carlos Mauricio Funes Cartagena of El Salvador in San Salvador, El Salvador Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/289687",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-carlos-mauricio-funes-cartagena-el-salvador,"President Funes. Good afternoon, and thank you so much for your presence. Thanks to all the friends of the press, both domestic and international.
First of all, I would like to thank President Obama for his visit, and also to his family and his committee--his delegation that accompanied this morning. And on behalf of my wife Vanda and all the people of El Salvador, I really thank you, Mr. President, for the support that you have given to the people of El Salvador and to the process of transition and building of democracy that we're going through. It is a great honor to have your presence in El Salvador. So welcome once again, Mr. President, and I hope that you enjoy, the few hours that you're going to be here, the hospitality of our people.
President Obama has asked me if this is the weather characteristic of this time of the year, and I was saying that, yes, and that it is a pity because if he had stayed a little bit longer we could have invited you to get to see the beaches of our country that are one of the best in the region.
Dear friends of the press, this visit of President Obama is historical. This encounter is produced when our country is immersed in a process of deep changes that started with the political--[inaudible]--a transition that took place in a very orderly and peaceful manner that has meant a transcendental step forward for the consolidation of our democracy and of our institutions in the fight for transparency.
Therefore, we are in face of a great opportunity for our political, economic, and social development, an opportunity that is historic in nature, to get--to do away with the obstacles that in the past did not allow us to advance as a unit towards a new model of development with social justice.
Your visit, Mr. President, is circumscribed within this process as showmanship of your recognition of the advancements in our democracy and the efforts that we have carried out as a people to reach international consensus that will allow us to continue progressing together facing the great challenges, especially poverty and the commitment to get greater levels of citizen security.
We coincided when we were talking with President Obama that this visit to the Latin America region is fundamental, and he was telling me some details of his meeting with President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil and the President of Chile.
The truth, Mr. President, is that this is a fundamental visit, first of all because Latin America, after the democratization process that we've gone through the last two decades, is now a region in peace that enjoys the deserved fruits of this great struggle for human rights and the strengthening of our democracies.
But also it is fundamental from point of view--the economic point of view because the majority of the Latin America countries are just overcoming this international crisis better than other countries in the world based on models against poverty and betting on their productive sectors and the hard-working people that they have.
We celebrate these circumstances that situate Latin America as a fundamental point within the international reference after this international crisis. And I think that the criteria with which you have based your visit to Latin America is a support to the path that my country has taken, to take Brazil and the United States as my points of reference.
First, because Chile represents for us an example of democratic transition that was very successful of overcoming dictatorships and polarization. It is a country that has been able to cure its injuries to reach this institutional soundness that we admire so much.
And Brazil has also shown in the 8 years of the Presidency of my friend Lula, and now with the starting of the Presidency of Dilma, Brazil has demonstrated that the struggle against poverty is the greatest engine for growth, and that this model that strives to improve production is also our inspiration.
So we celebrate being part of this visit, of this tour, and to be able to go more in depth in this friendship that we started on March 8 last year when I visited you in Washington.
And allow me briefly before I give the floor to President Obama to synthesize from my perspective some of the topics that we developed in this bilateral agenda.
First of all, as I said in private, now I say it in public in front of the friends of the press, I want to thank publicly the President of the United States for including our country in such important initiatives like the BRIDGE project and the Partnership for Growth.
Both are very important processes for us. And in this sense, we have requested the President to dynamize this process so that these projects can become a reality as soon as possible. We already have a schedule that foresees the definition of great projects in June, with which we will start this partnership.
I also want to thank the words of President Obama when he recognizes the importance of our population in the development of his country: the presence of more than 2 million of Salvadorans that work and live in the United States and the importance that this population has in the development of El Salvador through the remittances that they send year by year.
Of course, migration was another key issue in our conversation. We coincided once again with President Obama on the need to have focus for development and joint responsibility in this sense. We also coincided that with regards to migration, the best strategy is the struggle against poverty and the creation of opportunities to have our people stay in their places of origin.
Migration is a painful expression of a world that has not been able to establish accessible parameters of justice and inclusion. I have expressed to President Obama my pleasure when I heard in his speech at the Union State the commitment of pushing an agreement of both parties, bipartisan agreement for comprehensive immigration reform and present it to the Congress of the United States.
And finally, we also talked about security, and we did so in an extended meeting with the presence of officials of the Cabinet of President Obama, as well as ours. This has been a key issue in this meeting, and I have expressed to President Obama the willingness of my Government to continue with the efforts of Central American security.
We said that narco-activity, such as an insecurity, is not an issue that is only a problem for El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua isolatedly, not even Colombia or Mexico alone. It's a problem that attacks us as a region. And this is why we are building a regional strategy through the CARSI Initiative.
Of course, I also insisted that this is an issue that should not only be approached through the persecution of the crime by our armies and police, but that we have to stress on prevention policies. And therefore, the best weapon to combat and reduce crime in the region is through the investment in social policies.
And finally, I thanked President Obama, as I do it right now in public, for his decision to visit the tomb of Monsignor Arnulfo Romero and the kindness of his invitation to accompany him in this historical visit. As I have said, Monsignor is the spiritual guide of this nation, and the visit that you are going to carry out to the tomb of Monsignor implies for us a recognition of a leader, an international leader like President Obama, to the message of Oscar Arnulfo Romero and the universal validity of his message.
Thank you once again for your stay in our country, and we thank you for the expression of kindness by your wife and your children in this visit to El Salvador. Thank you very much, Mr. President.
President Obama. President Funes, thank you so much for your very generous words. It was a pleasure to welcome you and First Lady Pignato to the White House last year. I want to thank you today for welcoming me and my wife and our daughters to El Salvador. We are honored to be here.
Yesterday in Santiago, Chile, I outlined how the United States is forging partnerships for progress with nations and peoples across Latin America. And there are few better examples of both the opportunities and challenges facing the Americas today than here in El Salvador.
Fortunately for El Salvador, it enjoys the wise leadership of President Funes. And, Mr. President, I want to commend you for your courageous work to overcome old divisions in Salvadoran society and to show that progress comes through pragmatism and building consensus. You've articulated a vision of economic growth and social progress that is inclusive of all segments of Salvadoran society. And I want to make it clear today that the United States wants to be a partner with El Salvador in this process. We want El Salvador to be successful.
Thanks to smart investments in education, rural development, and infrastructure, El Salvador has made gains in reducing poverty. And to build on this progress, El Salvador is one of the first four countries in the world in our Partnership for Growth, which is a key element of my administration's new approach to development.
Instead of the old donor-recipient model, we're working as partners, with El Salvador in the lead, to confront the hurdles to growth and development. As El Salvador's largest trading partner, we'll help identify reforms that can mobilize private investment, increase trade, and create opportunities for the Salvadoran people. And one of the most important steps is to foster collaborations between government and the private sector, because both have so much to gain when people are lifted out of poverty and contribute to their country's prosperity.
At the same time, we need to increase trade and economic growth across Central America. I very much appreciated the President's insights on the region. Today I'm pleased to announce a new effort, our Crossroads Partnership. We'll work with countries in the region to make borders more efficient and more secure so we're encouraging trade and economic growth rather than constraining it.
As President Funes mentioned, we discussed immigration. President Funes is committed to creating more economic opportunities here in El Salvador so that people don't feel like they have to head north to provide for their families. As I told the President, I remain firmly committed to comprehensive immigration reform in the United States.
I know this is especially important to the some 2 million Salvadoran people who are living and working in the United States. They're making extraordinary contributions to our country, even as they support their families and communities here in El Salvador. So I updated the President on the new consumer protections that I signed into law, which give people more information and make sure their remittances actually reach their loved ones back home.
Today we're also launching a new effort to confront the narcotraffickers and gangs that have caused so much violence in all of our countries and especially here in Central America. Our two nations already cooperate very closely in the fight against these criminals. As I said in my speech yesterday, the United States will do our part as the nations of Central America develop a new joint security strategy this spring.
Under the Central American Citizen Security Partnership that I'm announcing today, we'll focus $200 million to support efforts here in the region, including addressing, as President Funes indicated, the social and economic forces that drive young people towards criminality. We'll help strengthen courts, civil society groups and institutions that uphold the rule of law. And we'll work closely with regional partners like Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Canada, and international partners like Spain, the European Union, and the Inter-American Development Bank. This has to be a coordinated effort that draws on the unique expertise of different countries and institutions.
Finally, we're deepening our efforts to pursue sustainable energy and to address climate change, which is already a harsh reality for Salvadorans and people across the region who face more frequent and more severe storms. El Salvador is already a leader in geothermal energy. Under the Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas, El Salvador is working to connect grids in this region to make electricity more reliable. I want to commend President Funes for taking another step today, agreeing to host a regional center where the nations of this region can come together to find new ways to reduce emissions and prevent deforestation.
So again, Mr. President, I want to thank you for welcoming me here today and for your commitment to closer ties between our nations. I think the partnership that we're forging together are exactly what's needed in the Americas today: neighbors joining with neighbors to realize progress that none of us can achieve alone. Every nation, I believe, no matter how large or how small, can contribute to that progress. And I believe that under the leadership of President Funes, El Salvador can be a source of great prosperity and security for this region for many years to come.
So thank you very much.
Moderator. And now we will start with the questions and answers. We have two questions by the press of El Salvador and two questions by the press of the United States. El Salvador, Oscar Diaz, a journalist of La Presna Grafica.
Central American Citizen Security Partnership/Central American Regional Security Initiative
Q. Good afternoon. President Obama, I would like to ask you if you could explain a little bit more how you are going to distribute these 200 million throughout the region with regards to security.
And we would like to know the opinion of President Funes on the commitment of El Salvador and Central America in this effort.
President Obama. The emphasis is to work with a regional approach, and the various Central American countries have come together to help shape and design how that money might be best spent. So rather than the United States coming in and saying, here's the best way to do things, what we want to do is to hear what are the respective challenges that each country is facing.
The regional security initiatives that are already taking place, we can build on. We obviously need to focus on basic policing, security, rule of law, the judicial system; that's a component of it. But as President Funes indicated, part of the key is making sure that we're also using this to reach young people and give them the better path.
I thought President Funes gave a very eloquent response to one of my questions during our bilateral meeting. He said, ""I don't want a young man in El Salvador or a young woman in El Salvador to feel that the only two paths to moving up the income ladder is either to travel north or to join a criminal enterprise.""
And that's why emphasis on education and emphasizing social programs, giving young people other pathways has to be part of this overall program.
But we're in close consultation. This is a program that will be designed and led here in Central America by the respective governments. And I'm confident that President Funes will show great leadership in making sure that that money is appropriately used here in El Salvador.
President Funes. Thank you very much, President Obama, for your comments, especially for your expectations of this new contribution for the Central American region that President Obama is announcing today.
When we started with the CARSI Initiative, this initiative aimed at responding to a concern that we had as Presidents of the region, which is that organized crime, particularly as common crime and crime in general, is not a problem only of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, or Colombia, or Mexico. It's a problem that we can only face as a region. The capacity of operating of these criminal organizations, the financial capacity to buy institutions, to permeate the different institutions and penetrate our institutions is so large that if we do not join as countries, as nations, and if we do not use the successful experiences of countries like Colombia and Mexico, we will not be able to defeat this problem.
This is why I have been insisting in international fora and with Central American integration meeting in June last year, where we said that besides trade, we need to have a regional security policy. We have submitted our request to the authorities and the Government of the United States to have greater cooperation funds earmarked to perfecting our police, modernize our military institutions, and to also perfect and modernize our public ministries, especially in the development of a greater capacity to investigate crimes, specific crimes like financial crimes. We are projecting a training program with the assistance of the United States for 150 prosecutors to specialize on the investigation of complex crimes like the organized crime.
And something that is very important--and I'm pleased to hear that President Obama agrees with us--that the efforts that we make in repression and persecution of criminals is not going to do anything unless we take away from the criminals the fertile soil that they have found in this region. And this fertile soil is thanks to the fact that we have a lot of youngsters that are living in a situation of poverty and social exclusion, exclusion from the benefits and the services that the state should give them. And this is why I insisted with President Obama that we cannot continue offering our youngsters in El Salvador and the region, or go to the United States to find employment and entertaining and education opportunities that they don't find here, or to fall in the hands of the criminal gangs, especially the gangs.
How can we avoid this? Investing more in prevention policies. Our focus as a region, and particularly as the Government of El Salvador, is that the crime, and particularly drug trafficking and the consumption of drugs, is not only going to--by attacking supply, but also demand.
This is why this afternoon I also heard with great pleasure the President of the United States reiterate that his Government has invested a large amount of money in the combat of the reduction of consumption. Without consumption, you don't have any demand, no supply, and the criminal organizations dedicated to drug trafficking cannot continue making a profit. And this is what we want to do throughout the region because Central America is no longer a transfer or a passageway, but it's also a consumption strip.
White House Press Secretary James F. ""Jay"" Carney. The first question from the White House press corps will be from Julianna Goldman of Bloomberg.
Situation in Libya
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, President Funes.
Mr. President, on Libya, coalition partners can't seem to agree on who will take the lead in the next phase of the military campaign. Can you today still assure the American people that the U.S. will be in charge for only a matter of several--a few more days?
And also, we also learned today of two American pilots who went down in Libya. We're assured that they're safe. But have you sufficiently prepared the American people for the costs of war--of course, the human costs, but also the financial costs?
President Obama. Let me first of all say, obviously, we were extraordinarily relieved to find out that these two young men were safe in American hands. As the Pentagon indicated, this appears to have been a malfunction in the aircraft, and it is a testament to our military that we had fully prepared for any contingency, including something like this, and they were able to recover these individuals rapidly.
And in fact, as part of the planning effort leading up to this, I specifically had discussions with Admiral Mullen and other of our military personnel to make sure that we had the kind of standard recovery efforts in place, because there are risks involved. And on the day that I indicated that this was a possibility, and then on the day that I indicated that we, in fact, were moving forward, I said that there is no military operation that does not entail risk. And that's why this is always the most difficult decision that I make as Commander in Chief and as President of the United States.
Now, I have absolutely no doubt that we will be able to transfer control of this operation to an international coalition. I had discussions with Prime Minister Cameron and President Sarkozy today. In fact, NATO is meeting today as we speak to work out some of the mechanisms for command and control. I would expect that over the next several days you will have clarity and a meeting of the minds of all those who are participating in the process.
We're already seeing a significant reduction in the number of U.S. planes that are involved in operations over Libya, because, as I said initially, our job was to take our unique capabilities and create a space to shape the environment so that the operation of a no-fly zone could operate effectively and to make sure that our immediate humanitarian goals could be met.
And I just want to emphasize to the American people, because of the extraordinary capabilities and valor of our men and women in uniform, we have already saved lives. In Benghazi, a city of 700,000 people, you had the prospect of Qadhafi's forces carrying out his orders to show no mercy. That could have resulted in catastrophe in that town. Qadhafi's forces have pulled back because of this timely intervention.
And obviously, there are always risks involved in this kind of operation, but for us to be able to structure something where we bring our unique capabilities to bear to fulfill a mission that is supported by the international community against somebody who was about to direct his armed forces against his people in the most vicious of ways is something that, I think, the American people, and certainly our American military, should be proud of.
I said at the outset that this was going to be a matter of days and not weeks. And there's nothing based on how we've been able to execute over the last several days that changes that assessment.
Q. And on financial costs--[inaudible].
President Obama. We will continue to provide details to the American people about the costs of this operation. But because it is limited in time, scope, with a well-defined mission, we're confident that this is something that we can budget as part of our overall operations. I mean, keep in mind that there are costs involved in the rescue efforts that we are assisting in Japan. Events happen around the world in which the United States, with our unique capabilities, has to respond as a leader in the world community. We build those into our budget. This was something that we can build into our budget, and we're confident that not only can the goals be achieved, but that at the end of the day the American people are going to feel satisfied that lives were saved and people were helped. Okay.
Moderator. Now the Salvadoran media with Channels 2, 4, 6, we have Emilio Correa asking.
Immigration Reform/Development Assistance for El Salvador
Q. Good afternoon, President Obama. President, in the last few days, we have heard your statements where you talk about starting partnerships such as Partnerships for Growth and for Progress. Now we're talking about Crossroads Partnership. Going to more punctual matters, what does this consist of? Is there seed money? Is it going to be reimbursable or not? What projects are we talking about here and how much money could be generated?
And if possible, Mr. President, I would like to know about immigration, taking advantage of your presence here since we haven't been able to talk to you before. We have about 25 percent or 30 percent of our population without--well, living illegally in the United States. So what are your short-term plans, President Obama? Are you going to lobby for comprehensive reform or temporary residence for the Salvadorans that are working with the TPS or that are living with a TPS who are there? Thank you.
President Obama. Specifically on immigration reform first, as I indicated in my remarks and as I said in my State of the Union speech, I continue to believe in comprehensive immigration reform. America is a nation of laws and it is a nation of immigrants. And so our job is to create secure borders, to make sure that we're got a legal immigration system that is effective and is not frustrating for families, doesn't divide families.
But we also have to make sure that those who are in the United States illegally at this point, but in some cases have been there for a long time, in some cases have children who were born in the United States and are United States citizens, that they have a pathway to get right by the law. And several years ago, we were able to craft a bipartisan consensus, at least in the United States Senate, around this issue. Senator John McCain, Senator Ted Kennedy had a comprehensive immigration reform bill that I supported and was a part of when I was in the Senate. And we were able to get it passed through the Senate, and we couldn't get it passed through the House of Representatives.
Over the last 2 years, it's been more difficult to gain Republican support for some of these efforts. And my hope is, is that they begin to recognize over the next year that we can't solve this problem without taking a broad, comprehensive approach. And that will benefit not only those Salvadorans who are living in the United States, but it also, more importantly from the perspective of the region, can ensure that relations between neighbors and trade and economic relations between neighbors is more orderly and more secure, more regularized.
It is the right thing to do. This is the time to do it. And I will continue to push hard to make it happen. It won't be easy. The politics of this are difficult. But I am confident that ultimately we are going to get it done.
Now, with respect to particular programs, I will have my team provide a sheet that has details of how these various programs would work. We already mentioned the 200 million for security. There are other initiatives that are very important. The Partnership for Growth, the immediate plans involve our experts meeting with President Funes's economic advisers and exports to determine what exactly are the barriers for improved growth and development here in El Salvador.
So one of the ways that we are redesigning our development assistance programs is to recognize that dollars are important, but institutional reforms may end up being more important, or at least, they have to go hand in hand, because what a country like El Salvador does not want is perpetually to be looking for the outside for its own development. Ultimately, it wants to be able to find growth and tap into its own potential here inside the country.
And so those are the kinds of systematic consultations that are currently taking place, which will help determine how we can best spend any develop money that's put forward.
Of course, we already have currently a Millennium Challenge grant coming into El Salvador that involves several hundred million dollars and is helping on a wide variety of fronts. And we want to continue to build on some of the successes that are taking place there.
White House Press Secretary Carney. The next question from the White House Press Corps is Savannah Guthrie from NBC News.
Situation in Libya/Situation in the Middle East
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, President Funes. President Obama, you mentioned a few minutes ago how this mission in Libya was narrow in scope, limited in duration. But potentially it seems quite open-ended in the sense that as long as Qadhafi remains in power, civilians presumably will need protection from him. My question to you is, what is your exit strategy for U.S. military involvement if Qadhafi does not succumb to the international pressures to leave? Are you saying, essentially, the U.S. will hang in there militarily in Libya if Qadhafi hangs in there?
And in the grand tradition of U.S. press asking multipart questions, one more. Setting aside the humanitarian goals that you just mentioned a few minutes ago, can you articulate the U.S. national security interest in military action in Libya? Thank you, sir.
President Obama. The military action that we moved forward on, in conjunction with our international partners, was defined by the U.N. Security Council resolution that said we have a humanitarian threat and we need to deal with that humanitarian threat quickly, in part through a no-fly zone, in part by ensuring that humanitarian assistance can get into places that need it. And what we've done is to create the space for that to happen.
I think fairly shortly we are going to be able to say that we've achieved the objective of a no-fly zone. We will also be able to say that we have averted immediate tragedy.
Now, you were absolutely right that as long as Qadhafi remains in power, unless he changes his approach and provides the Libyan people an opportunity to express themselves freely and there are significant reforms in the Libyan Government, unless he is willing to step down, that there are still going to be potential threats towards the Libyan people.
And we will continue to support the efforts to protect the Libyan people, but we will not be in the lead. That's what the transition that I discussed has always been designed to do. We have unique capabilities. We came in, up front, fairly heavily, fairly substantially, and at considerable risk to our military personnel. And when this transition takes place, it is not going to be our planes that are maintaining the no-fly zone. It is not going to be our ships that are necessarily involved in enforcing the arms embargo. That's precisely what the other coalition partners are going to do.
And that's why building this international coalition has been so important because it means that the United States is not bearing all the ","cost. It means that we have confidence that we are not going in alone and it is our military that is being volunteered by others to carry out missions that are important not only to us, but are important internationally. And we will accomplish that in a relatively short period of time.
Now, with respect to our national interests, the American people and the United States have an interest, first of all, in making sure that where a brutal dictator is threatening his people and saying he will show no mercy and go door-to-door hunting people down, and we have the capacity under international sanction to do something about that, I think it's in America's international--in America's national interest to do something about it.
That doesn't mean that we can solve every problem in the world. It does mean that when you have not only the United Nations, but also the Arab League and also other countries in the Gulf who are saying, we need to intercede to make sure that a disaster doesn't happen on our watch, as has happened in the past when the international community stood idly by, it is in America's national interest to participate in that. Because nobody has a bigger stake in making sure that there are basic rules of the road that are observed, that there is some semblance of order and justice--particularly in a volatile region that's going through great changes like the Middle East--than does the United States of America.
Now, we've already seen what happened in Egypt and Tunisia: peaceful transitions. We have a huge national interest in making sure that those are successful because if Egypt can make a transition from an autocratic regime to a democracy, if Tunisia can make those same changes, they become models for a peaceful transition that at some point may be adopted by other countries in the region.
If on the other hand, they spill into chaos, in part because they've got a million Lebanese--or a million Libyans who are pouring into these countries, and their borders become less secure, and there's a breakdown of order, that could have spillover effects in the entire region.
So not only do we have a humanitarian interest, but we also have a very practical interest in making sure that the changes that are sweeping through that region are occurring in a peaceful nonviolent fashion.
And when we can have some impact on that with a relatively modest contribution as part of a broader international effort, then I absolutely believe that the costs are outweighed by the benefits, and that is what drove my decision. And that's why I think that we need to make sure that we see this through effectively.
President Funes. We are just going to make reference to a prior question from--this is, Mr. President--with your permission, President Obama, and also to address any other doubt of the media that they may have.
I just want to go back to the matter of El Salvador and the remarks made by--[inaudible]--regarding the importance of these announcements made by President Obama with regards to projects that may be financed through the BRIDGE Initiative and the Partnership for Growth.
We need to place things in context. What's fundamental in my opinion in this Partnership for Growth is that the different visions at the foundation of this initiative that is driven by the Government of President Obama. It's not the traditional way of looking at the region from the perspective of the donor that looks at the receiver as that, as a mere receiver or beneficiary of the same. And I said this to President Obama: I cannot go to the United States or any other country of the world to knock on the doors of the multilateral banking system or the doors of the USAID or any other cooperation agency of the United States in order to ask for either more credits or more nonreversible cooperation funds without making a domestic effort that has not taken place in the past and that we cannot delay much further.
We need to also give our contribution in this partnership and leave our differences in that the financial aid capacity that we have. But just to include the country of El Salvador in this it's a message to the international investors that we can trust El Salvador. The Government of El Salvador is now working on a series of projects that will be presented to the intergovernment teams in this next April so that in June we can have a better idea of which of these programs or these projects are going to be financed. And we have an initiative in the port region, especially in the extension of the Comalapa airport, which I explained to President Obama in our bilateral meeting that we just had, but also in the transportation public system and also in renewable energy projects. So that once we have these projects prepared and already submitted to the intergovernment teams, we hope that in June we will have taken a decision on this regard, but from a different perspective.
No longer will it be a country that receives aid as a donor or receiver from a donor country without us doing our own efforts. And what does this effort consist of? And I already mentioned this to President Obama that we need to have a fiscal agreement that will send more funds to the Internal Revenue so that we can reactivate the economy, but also to fight against poverty and social exclusion.
This is an effort that we need to carry out. We cannot--no longer be one of the countries with the lowest tax returns, only surpassed by Guatemala. We need to be able to increase this revenue and close with about 17 percent of the GDP. It's still low compared to other countries of the region, not to mention the United States, but it's what we need to do as a nation.
But what's important in this is that we can send a message to the investors that we can invest in El Salvador, be them foreign and national investors, and that the type of partnership that we are taking about and that we are creating with the United States by initiative of the U.S. Government will then imply a joint cooperation where not only the United States will contribute with resources, but also El Salvador will. And we'll have a set of institutional and political reforms that will have transparent management of these funds.
So this is why in the following days we will send to the Legislative Assembly our public-private association that will be driven by the BRIDGE project and the Partnership for Growth. And we will continue sending all the initiatives that are necessary to create the institutional environment that will make it possible for us to have this economic predictability and also for this trust to take place with the investors.
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, everyone."
"June 29, 2011",The President's News Conference,Barack Obama,"Barack Obama, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/290777",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1111,"The President. Good morning, everybody. Have a seat, please. I just want to say a few words about the economy before I take your questions.
There are a lot of folks out there who are still struggling with the effects of the recession. Many people are still looking for work or looking for a job that pays more. Families are wondering how they deal with a broken refrigerator or a busted transmission or how they're going to finance their kids' college education, and they're also worrying about the possibility of layoffs.
The struggles of middle class families were a big problem long before the recession hit in 2007. They weren't created overnight, and the truth is, our economic challenges are not going to be solved overnight. But there are more steps that we can take right now that would help businesses create jobs here in America.
Today, our administration is trying to take those steps, so we're reviewing Government regulations so that we can fix any rules in place that are an unnecessary burden on businesses. We're working with the private sector to get small businesses and startups the financing they need to grow and expand. And because of the partnership that we've launched with businesses and community colleges, 500,000 workers will be able to receive the right skills and training for manufacturing jobs in companies all across America, jobs that companies are looking to fill.
In addition to the steps that my administration can take on our own, there are also things that Congress could do right now that will help create good jobs. Right now Congress can send me a bill that would make it easier for entrepreneurs to patent a new product or idea, because we can't give innovators in other countries a big leg up when it comes to opening new businesses and creating new jobs. That's something Congress could do right now.
Right now Congress could send me a bill that puts construction workers back on the job rebuilding roads and bridges, not by having Government fund and pick every project, but by providing loans to private companies and States and local governments on the basis of merit and not politics. That's pending in Congress right now.
Right now Congress can advance a set of trade agreements that would allow American businesses to sell more of their goods and services to countries in Asia and South America, agreements that would support tens of thousands of American jobs while helping those adversely affected by trade. That's pending before Congress right now.
And right now we could give middle class families the security of knowing that the tax cut I signed in December will be there for one more year.
So there are a number of steps that my administration is taking, but there are also a number of steps that Congress could be taking right now on items that historically have had bipartisan support and that would help put more Americans back to work.
Many of these ideas have been tied up in Congress for some time. But, as I said, all of them enjoy bipartisan support and all of them would help grow the economy. So I urge Congress to act on these ideas now.
Of course, one of the most important and urgent things we can do for the economy is something that both parties are working on right now, and that's reducing our Nation's deficit. Over the last few weeks, the Vice President has been leading negotiations with Democrats and Republicans on this issue, and they've made some real progress in narrowing down the differences. As of last week, both parties had identified more than $1 trillion worth of spending cuts already.
But everyone also knows that we'll need to do more to close the deficit. We can't get to the $4 trillion in savings that we need by just cutting the 12 percent of the budget that pays for things like medical research and education funding and food inspectors and the weather service. And we can't just do it by making seniors pay more for Medicare. So we're going to need to look at the whole budget, as I said several months ago. And we've got to eliminate waste wherever we find it and make some tough decisions about worthy priorities.
And that means trimming the defense budget, while still meeting our security needs. It means we'll have to tackle entitlements, as long as we keep faith with seniors and children with disabilities by maintaining the fundamental security that Medicare and Medicaid provide. And yes, we're going to have to tackle spending in the Tax Code.
There's been a lot of discussion about revenues and raising taxes in recent weeks, so I want to be clear about what we're proposing here. I spent the last 2 years cutting taxes for ordinary Americans, and I want to extend those middle class tax cuts. The tax cuts I'm proposing we get rid of are tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires, tax breaks for oil companies and hedge fund managers and corporate jet owners.
It would be nice if we could keep every tax break there is, but we've got to make some tough choices here if we want to reduce our deficit. And if we choose to keep those tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires, if we choose to keep a tax break for corporate jet owners, if we choose to keep tax breaks for oil and gas companies that are making hundreds of billions of dollars, then that means we've got to cut some kids off from getting a college scholarship. That means we've got to stop funding certain grants for medical research. That means that food safety may be compromised. That means that Medicare has to bear a greater part of the burden. Those are the choices we have to make.
So the bottom line is this: Any agreement to reduce our deficit is going to require tough decisions and balanced solutions. And before we ask our seniors to pay more for health care, before we cut our children's education, before we sacrifice our commitment to the research and innovation that will help create more jobs in the economy, I think it's only fair to ask an oil company or a corporate jet owner that has done so well to give up that tax break that no other business enjoys. I don't think that's real radical. I think the majority of Americans agree with that.
So the good news is, because of the work that's been done, I think we can actually bridge our differences. I think there is a conceptual framework that would allow us to make huge progress on our debt and deficit and do so in a way that does not hurt our economy right here and right now.
And it's not often that Washington sees both parties agree on the scale and the urgency of the challenge at hand. Nobody wants to put the creditworthiness of the United States in jeopardy. Nobody wants to see the United States default. So we've got to seize this moment, and we have to seize it soon. The Vice President and I will continue these negotiations with both leaders of both parties in Congress for as long as it takes, and we will reach a deal that will require our Government to live within its means and give our businesses confidence and get this economy moving.
So with that, I will take your questions. I've got my list here. I'm starting off with Ben Feller, Associated Press.
National Debt and Deficit
Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I'd like to follow up on the comments you just made as you try to reach a deal to raise the debt limit and cut the deficit. You keep saying that there needs to be this balanced approach of spending cuts and taxes. But Republicans say flatly, they won't----
The President. That they don't want a balanced approach.
Q. They don't want any tax increases, as they put it. And the House Speaker says not only that he doesn't support that, but that plan won't--will not pass the House. So my question is, will you insist, ultimately, that a deal has to include those tax increases that you just laid out? Is that an absolute red line for you? And if it is, can you explain to us how that can possibly get through the Congress?
The President. Look, I think that what we've seen in negotiations here in Washington is a lot of people say a lot of things to satisfy their base or to get on cable news, but that, hopefully, leaders at a certain point rise to the occasion and they do the right thing for the American people. And that's what I expect to happen this time. Call me naive, but my expectation is that leaders are going to lead.
Now, I just want to be clear about what's at stake here. The Republicans say they want to reduce the deficit. Every single observer who's not an elected official, who's not a politician, says we can't reduce our deficit in the scale and scope that we need to without having a balanced approach that looks at everything.
Democrats have to accept some painful spending cuts that hurt some of our constituencies and we may not like. And we've shown a willingness to do that for the greater good. To say, look, there are some things that are good programs that are nice to have, we can't afford them right now.
I, as Commander in Chief, have to have difficult conversations with the Pentagon saying, you know what, there's fat here, we're going to have to trim it out. And Bob Gates has already done a good job identifying $400 billion in cuts, but we're going to do more. And I promise you the preference of the Pentagon would be not to cut any more, because they feel like they've already given.
So we're going to have to look at entitlements, and that's always difficult politically. But I've been willing to say we need to see where we can reduce the costs of health care spending and Medicare and Medicaid in the out-years, not by shifting costs on to seniors, as some have proposed, but rather by actually reducing those costs. But even if we're doing it in a smart way, that's still tough politics. But it's the right thing to do.
So the question is, if everybody else is willing to take on their sacred cows and do tough things in order to achieve the goal of real deficit reduction, then I think it would be hard for the Republicans to stand there and say that the tax break for corporate jets is sufficiently important that we're not willing to come to the table and get a deal done. Or we're so concerned about protecting oil and gas subsidies for oil companies that are making money hand over fist, that's the reason we're not going to come to a deal.
I don't think that's a sustainable position. And the truth of the matter is, if you talk to Republicans who are not currently in office, like Alan Simpson who cochaired my bipartisan commission, he doesn't think that's a sustainable position. Pete Domenici, Republican, cochaired something with Alice Rivlin, the Democrat, says that's--he doesn't think that's a sustainable position. You can't reduce the deficit to the levels that it needs to be reduced without having some revenue in the mix.
And the revenue we're talking about isn't coming out of the pockets of middle class families that are struggling. It's coming out of folks who are doing extraordinarily well and are enjoying the lowest tax rates since before I was born.
If you are a wealthy CEO or a health--hedge fund manager in America right now, your taxes are lower than they have ever been. They're lower than they've been since the 1950s. And you can afford it. You'll still be able to ride on your corporate jet; you're just going to have to pay a little more.
And if we--I just want to emphasize what I said earlier. If we do not have revenues, that means there are a bunch of kids out there who are not getting college scholarships. If we do not have those revenues, then the kinds of cuts that would be required might compromise the National Weather Service. It means that we would not be funding critical medical research. It means that food inspection might be compromised. And I've said to some of the Republican leaders, you go talk to your constituents, the Republican constituents, and ask them are they willing to compromise their kids' safety so that some corporate jet owner continues to get a tax break. And I'm pretty sure what the answer would be.
So we're going to keep on having these conversations. And my belief is, is that the Republican leadership in Congress will, hopefully, sooner rather than later, come to the conclusion that they need to make the right decisions for the country, that everybody else has been willing to move off their maximalist position; they need to do the same.
Q. You think they'll ultimately give ground on that?
The President. My expectation is that they'll do the responsible thing.
Chuck Todd [NBC News].
Libya
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. There have been a lot of questions about the constitutionality--constitutional interpretations of a few decisions you've made, so I'll just simply ask: Do you believe the War Powers Act is constitutional? Do you believe that the debt limit is constitutional, the idea that Congress can do this? And do you believe that marriage is a civil right?
The President. Well, that was a hodgepodge. [Laughter] Chuck, we're going to assign you to the Supreme Court, man. [Laughter]
I'm not a Supreme Court Justice, so I'm not going to put my constitutional law professor hat on here. Let me focus on, initially, the issue of Libya. I want to talk about the substance of Libya because there's been all kinds of noise about process and congressional consultation and so forth. Let's talk about concretely what's happened.
Muammar Qadhafi, who, prior to Usama bin Laden, was responsible for more American deaths than just about anybody on the planet, was threatening to massacre his people. And as part of an international coalition, under a U.N. mandate that is almost unprecedented, we went in and took out air defense systems so that an international coalition could provide a no-fly zone, could protect--provide humanitarian protection to the people on the ground.
I spoke to the American people about what we would do. I said there would be no troops on the ground. I said that we would not be carrying the lion's share of this operation, but as members of NATO, we would be supportive of it because it's in our national security interests and also because it's the right thing to do.
We have done exactly what I said we would do. We have not put any boots on the ground. And our allies--who, historically, we've complained aren't willing to carry enough of the load when it comes to NATO operations--have carried a big load when it comes to these NATO operations. And as a consequence, we've protected thousands of people in Libya; we have not seen a single U.S. casualty; there's no risks of additional escalation. This operation is limited in time and in scope.
So I said to the American people, here's our narrow mission. We have carried out that narrow mission in exemplary fashion. And throughout this process we consulted with Congress. We've had 10 hearings on it. We've sent reams of information about what the operations are. I've had all the Members of Congress over to talk about it. So a lot of this fuss is politics.
And if you look substantively at what we've done, we have done exactly what we said to do, under a U.N. mandate, and we have protected thousands of lives in the process. And as a consequence, a guy who was a state sponsor of terrorist operations against the United States of America is pinned down, and the noose is tightening around him.
Now, when you look at the history of the War Powers Resolution, it came up after the Vietnam war in which we had half a million soldiers there, tens of thousands of lives lost, hundreds of billions of dollars spent, and Congress said, you know what, we don't want something like that happening again. So if you're going to start getting us into those kinds of commitments, you've got to consult with Congress beforehand.
And I think that such consultation is entirely appropriate. But do I think that our actions in any way violate the War Powers Resolution? The answer is no. So I don't even have to get to the constitutional question.
Q. [inaudible]
The President.There may be a time in which there was a serious question as to whether or not the War Powers Resolution act was constitutional. I don't have to get to the question.
We have engaged in a limited operation to help a lot of people against one of the worst tyrants in the world--somebody who nobody should want to defend--and we should be sending a unified message to this guy that he should step down and give his people a fair chance to live their lives without fear. And this suddenly becomes the cause celebre for some folks in Congress? Come on.
So you had, what, a three-parter? [Laughter] What are the other two?
Q. There is some question about the constitutionality of the War Powers Act.
The President. I'm just saying I don't have to reach it. That's a good legal answer.
Q. How about marriage being a civil right?
Lesbian, Bisexual, Gay, and Transgender Equality
The President. Let me start by saying that this administration, under my direction, has consistently said we cannot discriminate as a country against people on the basis of sexual orientation. And we have done more in the 2 1/2 years that I've been in here than the previous 43 Presidents to uphold that principle, whether it's ending ""don't ask, don't tell,"" making sure that gay and lesbian partners can visit each other in hospitals, making sure that Federal benefits can be provided to same-sex couples. Across the board--hate crimes--we have made sure that that is a central principle of this administration, because I think it's a central principle of America.
Now, what we've also done is we've said that DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act, is unconstitutional. And so we've said we cannot defend the Federal Government poking its nose into what States are doing and putting the thumb on the scale against same-sex couples.
What I've seen happen over the last several years, and what happened in New York last week, I think, was a good thing, because what you saw was the people of New York having a debate, talking through these issues. It was contentious, it was emotional, but ultimately, they made a decision to recognize civil marriages. And I think that's exactly how things should work.
Q. [inaudible]--marriage is a civil right?
The President.And so I think it is important for us to work through these issues, because each community is going to be different and each State is going to be different--to work through them. In the meantime, we filed a--we filed briefs before the Supreme Court that say we think that any discrimination against gays, lesbians, transgenders is subject to heightened scrutiny, and we don't think that DOMA is unconstitutional [constitutional]*. And so I think the combination of what States are doing, what the courts are doing, the actions that we're taking administratively, all are how the process should work.
Q. Are you at all uncomfortable that there could be different rules in different States, you know, and for somebody to make the argument that that's what we saw during segregation?
The President. Chuck, I think what you're seeing is a profound recognition on the part of the American people that gays and lesbians and transgender persons are our brothers, our sisters, our children, our cousins, our friends, our coworkers, and that they've got to be treated like every other American. And I think that principle will win out. It's not going to be perfectly smooth, and it turns out that the President--I've discovered since I've been in this office--can't dictate precisely how this process moves. But I think we're moving in a direction of greater equality, and I think that's a good thing.
Julianna [Julianna Goldberg, Bloomberg News].
National Debt and Deficit/Job Growth/Tax Reform/Trade/Boeing Company
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I only have a two-parter. [Laughter]
The President. Thanks.
Q. Are you concerned that the current debate over debt and deficits is preventing you from taking the kind of decisive and more balanced action needed to create jobs in this country, which is the number-one concern for Americans?
And also, one of the impediments to job growth that the business community repeatedly cites is the regulatory environment. So do you think that the NLRB complaint against Boeing, that that has created some of the--is an example of the kinds of regulations that chill job growth and also that you yourself has--have called ""just plain dumb""?
The President. I think it's important to understand that deficit reduction, debt reduction, should be part of an overall package for job growth over the long term. It's not the only part of it, but it's an important part of it.
So as I mentioned at the top, I think it's important for us to look at rebuilding our transportation infrastructure in this country. That could put people back to work right now, construction workers back to work right now. And it would get done work that America needs to get done. We used to have the best roads, the best bridges, the best airports. We don't anymore. And that's not good for our long-term competitiveness.
So we could put people to work right now and make sure that we're in a good position to win the future as well. I think----
Q. ----spending and--[inaudible].
The President. I'm going to get to it. I think that it's important for us to look at the Tax Code and figure out, are there ways that we can simplify it and also build on the work that we've already done, for example, saying to small businesses or startup businesses, you don't have to pay capital gains when you're in startup mode, because we want you to get out there and start a business. That's important. Making sure that SBA is helping to get financing to small businesses, that's important.
So there are a whole range of things that we can be doing. I think these trade deals will be important, because right now South Korea frankly has a better deal when it comes to our trading relationship than we do. Part of the reason I want to pass this trade deal is you see a whole bunch of Korean cars here in the United States and you don't see any American cars in Korea. So let's rebalance that trading relationship. That's why we should get this passed.
So there are a range of things that we could be doing right now. Deficit and debt reduction should be seen as part of that overall process, because I think if businesses feel confident that we've got our act together here in Washington, that not only is the Government not going to default, but we're also preparing for a future in which the population is getting older--and we're going to have more expenses on the Medicare side and Social Security--that businesses will feel more confident about investing here in the United States of America.
So I don't think they're contradictory. And as I've said before, certainly in my job, but, I think, Congress as well, they've got to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. So we can focus on jobs at the same time as we're focusing on debt and deficit reduction.
Now, one of the things that my administration has talked about is, is there, in fact, a bunch of--a tangle of regulations out there that are preventing businesses from growing and expanding as quickly as they should? Keep in mind that the business community is always complaining about regulations. When unemployment is at 3 percent and they're making record profits, they're going to still complain about regulations because, frankly, they want to be able to do whatever they think is going to maximize their profits.
I've got an obligation to make sure that we're upholding smart regulations that protect our air and protect our water and protect our food. If you're flying on a plane, you want to make sure that there are some regulations in place to assure safety in air travel, right? So there are some core regulations that we've got to maintain.
But what I have done--and this is unprecedented, by the way, no administration has done this before--is I've said to each agency, don't just look at current regulations--or don't just look at future regulations, regulations that we're proposing, let's go backwards and look at regulations that are already on the books, and if they don't make sense, let's get rid of them. And we are in the process of doing that, and we've already identified changes that could potentially save billions of dollars for companies over the next several years.
Now, you asked specifically about one decision that was made by the National Labor Relations Board, the NLRB, and this relates to Boeing. Essentially, the NLRB made a finding that Boeing had not followed the law in making a decision to move a plant. And it's an independent agency. It's going before a judge. So I don't want to get into the details of the case. I don't know all the facts. That's going to be up to a judge to decide.
What I do know is this: that as a general proposition, companies need to have the freedom to relocate. They have to follow the law, but that's part of our system. And if they're choosing to relocate here in the United States, that's a good thing. And what it doesn't make--what, I think, defies common sense would be a notion that we would be shutting down a plant or laying off workers because labor and management can't come to a sensible agreement.
So my hope is, is that even as this thing is working its way through, everybody steps back for a second and says, look, if jobs are being created here in the United States, let's make sure that we're encouraging that. And we can't afford to have labor and management fighting all the time, at a time when we're competing against Germany and China and other countries that want to sell goods all around the world. And obviously, the airplane industry is an area where we still have a huge advantage, and I want to make sure that we keep it. Okay?
Mark Landler [New York Times].
Detention and Prosecution of Alleged Terrorists
Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Yesterday Admiral McRaven testified before Congress that he was concerned that there wasn't a clear procedure to be followed if a terrorist were captured alive abroad. The administration has also been clear that it doesn't want to continue to send suspected terrorists to Guantanamo.
What message do you have for American men and women in uniform who are undertaking missions, like the very risky one to capture and kill bin Laden, about what they should do in the event that they capture someone alive? And does the lack of these clear procedures raise the risk that forces might be more inclined to kill suspected terrorists in the field, rather than capture them alive, thus depriving the U.S. of the intelligence that they could provide?
The President. Well, first of all, my top priority in each and every one of these situations is to make sure that we're apprehending those who would attack the United States; that we are getting all the intelligence that we can out of these individuals, in a way that's consistent with due process of law; and that we try them, we prosecute them, in a way that's consistent with rule of law.
And frankly, there are going to be different dispositions of the case depending on the situation. And there are going to be some times where a military commission may be appropriate. There are going to be some times where Article III courts are appropriate in terms of prosecution. And we do have a process to work through all the agencies--Department of Defense, Department of Justice, FBI, anybody else who might be involved in these kinds of operations--to think through on a case-by-case basis how a particular individual should be dealt with.
And I think that when it comes to our men and women in uniform who might be carrying out these missions, the instructions are not going to be based on whether or not the lawyers can sort out how we detain them or how we prosecute them. Their mission is to make sure that they apprehend the individual; they do so safely with minimum risk to American lives. And that's always going to be the priority, is just carrying out the mission. And that message is sent consistently to our men and women in uniform anytime they start carrying out one of these missions.
But I think it's important to understand, and the American people need to be assured, that any time we initiate a mission like this, our top priorities are making sure this person is not able to carry out attacks against the United States and that we're able to obtain actionable intelligence from those individuals. And so that mitigates against this danger that you're suggesting that our main goal is going to be to kill these individuals as opposed to potentially capturing them. Okay?

Afghanistan
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Last week when you gave your Afghanistan drawdown speech, the word ""victory,"" in terms of the overall war in Afghanistan, was not in your speech. So I'm wondering, sir, if you can define for the 100,000 troops you have in harm's way in Afghanistan ""victory"" in the war and for their families as well, sir.
The President. Well, I didn't use ""victory"" in my West Point speech either. What I said was we can be successful in our mission, which is narrowly drawn, and that is to make sure that Al Qaida cannot attack the United States of America or our allies or our interests overseas and to make sure that we have an Afghan Government that--and an Afghan people that can provide for their own security.
We are being successful in those missions. And the reason that we're in a position to draw down 10,000 troops this year and a total of 33,000 troops by the end of next summer is precisely because of the extraordinary work of our men and women in uniform. What they've been able to do is to severely cripple Al Qaida's capacities.
Obviously, bin Laden got the most attention, but even before the bin Laden operation, we had decimated the middle ranks and some of the upper ranks of Al Qaida. They're having a great deal of difficulty operating, a great deal of difficulty communicating and financing themselves, and"," we are going to keep the pressure on. And in part that's because of the extraordinary sacrifices that have been made by our men and women in uniform in Afghanistan.
What we've also been able to do is to ramp up the training of Afghan forces. So we've got an additional 100,000 Afghan troops, both army and police, that have been trained as a consequence of this surge. And that is going to give the Afghans more capacity to defend themselves, because it is in our national interest to make sure that you did not have a collapse of Afghanistan in which extremist elements could flood the zone once again and over time Al Qaida might be in a position to rebuild itself.
So what I laid out was a plan in which we are going to be drawing down our troops from Afghanistan after 10 very long years and an enormous sacrifice by our troops. But we will draw them in a--draw them down in a responsible way that will allow Afghanistan to defend itself and will give us the operational capacity to continue to put pressure on Al Qaida until that network is entirely defeated.
Q. I'm sure that you've been apprised of the attack on the Inter-Continental Hotel yesterday, sir. And does that concern you that Afghan forces may not be able to step up if these guys are able to attack a high-profile target in the nation's capital?
The President. Well, keep in mind the drawdown hasn't begun. So we understood that Afghanistan is a dangerous place, that the Taliban is still active, and that there are still going to be events like this on occasion. The question is, in terms of overall trend, is Afghan capacity increasing?
Kabul, for example, which contains a huge proportion of the Afghan population as a whole, has been largely policed by Afghan forces for quite some time. And they've done a reasonably good job. Kabul is much safer than it was, and Afghan forces in Kabul are much more capable than they were.
That doesn't mean that there are not going to be events like this potentially taking place, and that will probably go on for some time. Our work is not done. But as I said in my speech, the tide of war is receding. We have shifted to a transition phase. And much like we've seen in Iraq--where we've drawn down our troops, the remainder of our troops will be coming out by the end of this year, but Iraq has been able to maintain a democratic government and to tamp down violence there--we think a similar approach makes sense in Afghanistan.
But even in Iraq, you still see the occasional attack. These are still countries that are digging themselves out of a lot of war, a lot of conflict. They're dangerous places. And so they're not going to be perfectly safe, even if we were there. But we can improve the chances for the Afghan people to defend themselves.
Jim Sciutto [ABC News].
Libya
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You're aware that Senators Kerry and McCain have a proposal on the Senate floor to give you the leeway to continue operations in Libya for a further year. You've just said that this, from the beginning, has been an operation limited in time and scope. Initially, you said days, not weeks. Are you prepared, are the American people prepared for this operation, with American support, to continue for a further year? And is there any other definition of success than Qadhafi being removed from power?
The President. Well, first of all, Jim, just a slight correction. What I told the American people was that the initial phase where Americans were in the lead would take days, perhaps weeks. And that's exactly what happened, right? I mean, after around 2 weeks, a little less than 2 weeks, we had transitioned where NATO had taken full control of the operation. So promise made, promise kept.
Second, I think when you have the former Republican nominee for President, John McCain, and the former nominee for President on the Democratic side, John Kerry, coming together to support what we're doing in Libya, that should tell the American people that this is important. And I very much appreciate their efforts in that regard.
Third, when it comes to our definitions of success, the U.N. mandate has said that we are there to make sure that you do not see a massacre directed against Libyan civilians by the Libyan regime. The Libyan regime's capacity has been greatly reduced as a consequence of our operation. That's already been successful. What we've seen both in the east and in the west is that opposition forces have been able to mobilize themselves and start getting organized, and people are starting to see the possibility of a more peaceful future on the horizon.
What is also true is, as long as Qadhafi is still presenting himself as the head of the Libyan Government and as long as he still controls large numbers of troops, the Libyan people are going to be in danger of counteroffensives and of retribution. So there is no doubt that Qadhafi stepping down from power is--from the international community's perspective--going to be the primary way that we can assure that the overall mission of Libya's people being protected is accomplished.
And I just want to point out--I know it's something you know--the International Criminal Court identified Qadhafi as having violated international law, having committed war crimes. What we've seen is reports of troops engaging in horrible acts, including potentially using rape as a weapon of war. And so when you have somebody like that in charge of large numbers of troops, I think it'd be hard for us to feel confident that the Libyan people are going to be protected unless he steps down.
Now, what that means, whether there's the possibility of Libyans arriving at some sort of political settlement, that, I think, is something that ultimately the Libyan people are going to have to make a decision about, because the international community is there in service of that broader goal, of a peaceful Libya.
Q. Would you accept a political settlement with him involved as success from the American perspective?
The President. I would accept him stepping down so that he is not directing armed forces against the Libyan people. He needs to step down. He needs to go.
Laura Meckler [Wall Street Journal].
National Debt and Deficit/Tax Reform/National Economy
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. In these debt talks, would you accept--would you like to see some sort of tax breaks aimed at stimulating the economy, even though that would of course add to the deficit itself?
And I'd also like to follow up on one of your earlier answers about same-sex marriage. You said that it's a positive step that so many States, including New York, are moving towards that. Does that mean that you personally now do support same-sex marriage, putting aside what individual States decide? Is that your personal view?
The President. I'm not going to make news on that today. [Laughter] Good try though.
Q. Why not?
The President.And the--with respect to the deficit and debt talks and where we need to go, I do think it's important, since we're looking at how do we reduce the debt and deficit both in a 10-year window as well as beyond a 10-year window, to understand that one of the most important things we can do for debt and deficit reduction is to grow the economy.
And so if there are steps that in the short term may reduce the amount of cash in the treasury, but in the long term mean that we're growing at 3.5 percent instead of 2.5 percent, then those ideas are worth exploring.
Obviously, that was what we did in December during the lame duck session, when Democrats and Republicans came together and we said, you know what, a payroll tax cut makes sense in order to boost the economy, unemployment insurance makes sense in order to boost the economy. All that stuff puts money in people's pockets at a time when they're still struggling to dig themselves out of this recession. And so the American people have an extra thousand dollars, on average, in their pockets because of the tax cuts that we initiated. And that has helped cushion some of the tough stuff that happened in the first 6 months of this year, including the effects on oil prices as a consequence of what happened in the Middle East as well as what happened in Japan.
I think that it makes perfect sense for us to take a look at can we extend the payroll tax, for example, an additional year, and other tax breaks for business investment that could make a big difference in terms of creating more jobs right now.
What we need to do is to restore business confidence and the confidence of the American people that we're on track, that we're not going to get there right away, that this is a tough slog, but that we still are moving forward. And I think that it makes sense, as we're looking at an overall package, to see, are there some things that we can do to sustain the recovery, so long as the overall package achieves our goals: the goals that I set out, which is $4 trillion within a 10- to 12-year window, and making sure that we're bending the costs of things like health care over the long term?
Q. I'm sorry, I know you don't want to say anything further on the same-sex marriage issue, but what you said before really led me to believe that that's what is in your personal mind. And I'm wondering what's the distinction you're drawing.
The President. Laura, I think this has been asked and answered. I'll keep on giving you the same answer until I give you a different one, all right? And that won't be today. [Laughter]
Q. That's going to be the quote. We all use it--[inaudible].
The President. Yes, exactly. I thought you'd like that one. [Laughter]
Antonieta Cadiz [La Opinion]? There you are.
Immigration Reform/Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives Bureau's Gun Trafficking Operation
Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President.
The President. Yes.
Q. First, if you receive a mandatory E-Verify bill only without legalization, are you planning to veto that deal?
And second, on ""Fast and Furious,"" Members of Congress and the Government of Mexico are still waiting for answers. Are you planning to replace ATF leadership? And when can we expect the results of the current investigation?
The President. On the second question, as you know, my Attorney General has made clear that he certainly would not have ordered gun running to be able to pass through into Mexico. The investigation is still pending. I'm not going to comment on a current investigation. I've made very clear my views that that would not be an appropriate step by the ATF, and we got to find out how that happened. As soon as the investigation is completed, I think appropriate actions will be taken.
With respect to E-Verify, we need comprehensive immigration reform. I've said it before. I will say it again. I will say it next week, and I'll say it 6 months from now. We've got to have a system that makes sure that we uphold our tradition as a nation of laws and that we also uphold our tradition as a nation of immigrants. And that means tough border security, going after employers that are illegally hiring and exploiting workers, making sure that we also have a pathway for legal status for those who are living in the shadows right now.
We may not be able to get everything that I would like to see in a package, but we have to have a balanced package. E-Verify can be an important enforcement tool if it's not riddled with errors, if U.S. citizens are protected, because what I don't want is a situation in which employers are forced to set up a system that they can't be certain works. And we don't want to expose employers to the risk where they end up rejecting a qualified candidate for a job because the list says that that person is an illegal immigrant, and it turns out that the person isn't an illegal immigrant. That wouldn't be fair for the employee and would probably get the employer in trouble as well.
So I think the goal right now is to let's continue to see if we can perfect the E-Verify system. Let's make sure that we have safeguards in place to prevent the kind of scenarios that I talked about. But let's also not lose sight of some of the other components to immigration reform. For example, making sure that ""DREAM Act"" kids--kids who have grown up here in the United States, think of themselves as Americans, who are not legal through no fault of their own, and who are ready to invest and give back to our country and go to school and fight in our military and start businesses here--let's make sure that those kids can stay. We need to have a more balanced approach than just a verification system. Okay?
Q. [inaudible]
The President. I don't have an answer as to whether the investigation is completed yet, and it wouldn't be appropriate for me to comment on the investigation if I don't--if it's not yet completed.
Jessica Yellin [CNN]. Congratulations, your first question here.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. No pressure. You're going to do great. [Laughter]
National Debt and Deficit
Q. Thank you. Your administration has laid out four different dates by which you've said that the debt ceiling must be raised or the U.S. would face potential dire consequences. Three of those dates have come and gone, and we haven't faced financial calamity. Some of your critics have argued that these are then scare tactics to force a deal. So why should the American people believe that the August 2 deadline is the final deadline by which a deal must be raised? And would you also spell out for us what you believe will happen if the debt ceiling is not raised by that date?
The President. Jessica, let's be clear. We haven't given out four different dates. We have given out dates that are markers for us getting into trouble. It's the equivalent of you're driving down the street and the red--the yellow light starts flashing. The yellow light is flashing. Now, it hasn't been a red light yet. So what Tim Geithner has said is, technically speaking, we're in a position now where we're having to do a whole bunch of things to make sure that our bills are paid.
By August 2, we run out of tools to make sure that all our bills are paid. So that is a hard deadline. And I want everybody to understand that this is a jobs issue. This is not an abstraction. If the United States Government, for the first time, cannot pay its bills, if it defaults, then the consequences for the U.S. economy will be significant and unpredictable. And that is not a good thing.
We don't know how capital markets will react. But if capital markets suddenly decide, you know what, the U.S. Government doesn't pay its bills, so we're going to start pulling our money out, and the U.S. Treasury has to start to raise interest rates in order to attract more money to pay off our bills, that means higher interest rates for businesses; that means higher interest rates for consumers. So all the headwinds that we're already experiencing in terms of the recovery will get worse.
That's not my opinion. I think that's a consensus opinion. And that means that job growth will be further stymied, it will be further hampered, as a consequence of that decision. So that's point number one.
Point number two, I want to address what I've been hearing from some quarters, which is, well, maybe this debt limit thing is not really that serious; we can just pay interest on the debt. This idea has been floating around in some Republican circles.
This is the equivalent of me saying, you know what, I will choose to pay my mortgage, but I'm not going to pay my car note. Or I'm going to pay my car note, but I'm not going to pay my student loan. Now, a lot of people in really tough situations are having to make those tough decisions. But for the U.S. Government to start picking and choosing like that is not going to inspire a lot of confidence.
Moreover, which bills are we going to decide to pay? These guys have said, well, maybe we just pay the interest on--for bondholders. So are we really going to start paying interest to Chinese who hold Treasurys, and we're not going to pay folks their Social Security checks? Or we're not going to pay to veterans for their disability checks? I mean, which bills, which obligations, are we going to say we don't have to pay?
And last point I want to make about this. These are bills that Congress ran up. The money has been spent. The obligations have been made. So this isn't a situation--I think the American people have to understand this--this is not a situation where Congress is going to say, okay, we won't buy this car or we won't take this vacation. They took the vacation. They bought the car. And now they're saying maybe we don't have to pay or we don't have to pay as fast as we said we were going to or--that's not how responsible families act. And we're the greatest nation on Earth, and we can't act that way.
So this is urgent, and it needs to get settled.
Q. So is August 2 a yellow light or a red light?
The President. I think people should think of--look, I'm the President of the United States, and I want to make sure that I am not engaging in scare tactics. And I've tried to be responsible and somewhat restrained so that folks don't get spooked.
August 2 is a very important date. And there's no reason why we can't get this done now. We know what the options are out there. This is not a technical problem any longer. This is a matter of Congress going ahead and biting the bullet and making some tough decisions. Because we know what the decisions are. We've identified what spending cuts are possible. We've identified what defense cuts are possible. We've identified what health care cuts are possible. We've identified what loopholes in the Tax Code can be closed that would also raise revenue. We've identified what the options are. And the question now is are we going to step up and get this done.
And you know, Malia and Sasha generally finish their homework a day ahead of time. Malia is 13; Sasha is 10.
Q. Impressive.
The President. It is impressive. They don't wait until the night before. They're not pulling all-nighters. [Laughter] They're 13 and 10. Congress can do the same thing. If you know you've got to do something, just do it.
And I've got to say, I'm very amused when I start hearing comments about, well, the President needs to show more leadership on this. Let me tell you something. Right after we finished dealing with the Government shutdown--averting a Government shutdown, I called the leaders here together. I said we've got to get done--get this done. I put Vice President Biden in charge of a process--that, by the way, has made real progress--but these guys have met, worked through all of these issues. I met with every single caucus for an hour to an hour and a half each: Republican Senators, Democratic Senators; Republican House, Democratic House. I've met with the leaders multiple times. At a certain point, they need to do their job.
And so this thing, which is just not on the level, where we have meetings and discussions, and we're working through process, and when they decide they're not happy with the fact that at some point you've got to make a choice, they just all step back and say, well, you know, the President needs to get this done. They need to do their job.
Now is the time to go ahead and make the tough choices. That's why they're called leaders. And I've already shown that I'm willing to make some decisions that are very tough and will give my base of voters further reason to give me a hard time. But it's got to be done.
And so there's no point in procrastinating. There's no point in putting it off. We've got to get this done. And if by the end of this week, we have not seen substantial progress, then I think Members of Congress need to understand we are going to start having to cancel things and stay here until we get it done.
They're in one week; they're out one week. And then they're saying: ""Obama has got to step in. You need to be here."" I've been here. I've been doing Afghanistan and bin Laden and the Greek crisis. You stay here. Let's get it done.
All right. I think you know my feelings about that. [Laughter]
Caren Bohan [Reuters].
National Debt and Deficit/National Economy
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You talked about the payroll tax holiday and possibly extending that. Are you worried, though, that by adding a discussion of short-term measures on the economy into these discussions about long-term deficit reductions that that may complicate the conversation and make it harder to pass a debt limit?
The President. I will--let me put it this way. If we've got a good deal on debt and deficit reduction that focuses not just on the 10-year window, but also the long term, we will get it done. And then we can argue about some other things, because I think that's very important.
I will say that precisely because tough votes in Congress are often avoided, that it may make sense to also deal with something like a payroll tax cut at the same time, because it does have budget implications and the American people need to know that we're focused on jobs and not just on deficit reduction, even though, as I said, deficit reduction helps to serve the job agenda. I think they want to have some confidence that we've got a plan that's helping right now.
But I don't think it should be a complicating factor, because if Mitch McConnell and John Boehner came to me and said, all right, we're ready to make a deal, here's a balanced approach to debt and deficit reduction, but we want to argue about payroll tax cuts later--they're not set to expire until the end of this year--if that was a situation that they presented, then I think we would have a serious conversation about that. I would not discount that completely.
I do think that the steps that I talked about to deal with job growth and economic growth right now are vitally important to deficit reduction. Just as deficit reduction is important to grow the economy and to create jobs, well, creating jobs and growing the economy also helps reduce the deficit. If we just increased the growth rate by one percentage point, that would drastically bring down the long-term projections of the deficit, because people are paying more into the coffers and fewer people are drawing unemployment insurance. It makes a huge difference.
And this may be sort of a good place to wrap up. You know, every day I get letters from folks all around the country who show incredible resilience, incredible determination, but they are having a very, very tough time. They're losing their homes. Some have lost their businesses. Some have lost work and have not been able to find jobs for months, maybe a year, maybe a year and a half. And they feel some desperation. And some folks who are working just are having a tough time paying the bills because they haven't seen their wages or incomes go up in 10 years, and the costs of everything else have gone up.
And every day that weighs on me. Every minute of every day that weighs on me. Because I ran for President precisely to make sure that we righted this ship and we start once again creating a situation where middle class families and people who aspire to be in the middle class, if they're working hard, then they're living a better life.
Now, these structural changes in our economy that have been going on for a decade--in some cases, longer--they're not going to be solved overnight. But we know what to do. We know that if we are educating our kids well, then they're going to be more competitive. We know that if we are investing in things like infrastructure, it pays off.
I was in Alcoa, in Iowa, one of our most successful companies. They took a big hit during the recession, but they still invested $90 million in new equipment in a plant that makes airplane wings and parts for automobiles. And they've bounced back. They've hired back all their people and are increasing market share because they made those investments.
Well, just like a company like Alcoa, America has got to make some investments. We know that we've got to get control of our deficit. There are some things that aren't going to solve all our problems but can make progress right now. And the question is whether or not Democrats and Republicans are willing to put aside the expedience of short-term politics in order to get it done.
And these folks are counting on us. They desperately want to believe that their leadership is thinking about them and not playing games. And I think that if all the leadership here in Washington has the faces and the stories of those families in mind, then we will solve this debt limit issue, we will put in place steps like a payroll tax cut and infrastructure development, we'll continue to fund education, we'll hold true to our commitment to our seniors.
These are solvable problems, but it does require us just getting out of the short-term and frankly selfish approach that sometimes politics breeds. We've got to think a bit long term. All right?
Thank you very much, everybody."
"October 06, 2011",The President's News Conference,Barack Obama,"Barack Obama, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/297368",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1108,"The President. Good morning, everybody. I will take your questions in a second. But first, I just want to say a few words about the economy.
Next week, the Senate will vote on the ""American Jobs Act."" And I think by now I've made my views pretty well known. Some of you are even keeping a tally of how many times I've talked about the ""American Jobs Act."" And the reason I keep going around the country talking about this jobs bill is because people really need help right now. Our economy really needs a jolt right now.
This is not a game; this is not the time for the usual political gridlock. The problems Europe is having today could have a very real effect on our economy at a time when it's already fragile. But this jobs bill can help guard against another downturn if the situation in Europe gets any worse. It will boost economic growth; it will put people back to work.
And by the way, this is not just my belief. This is what independent economists have said, not politicians, not just people in my administration. Independent experts who do this for a living have said this jobs bill will have a significant effect for our economy and for middle class families all across America. And what these independent experts have also said is that if we don't act, the opposite will be true. There will be fewer jobs; there will be weaker growth.
So as we look towards next week, any Senator out there who's thinking about voting against this jobs bill when it comes up for a vote, needs to explain exactly why they would oppose something that we know would improve our economic situation at such an urgent time for our families and for our businesses.
Congressional Republicans say one of the most important things we can do is cut taxes. Then they should love this plan. This jobs bill would cut taxes for virtually every worker and small business in America. If you're a small-business owner that hires someone or raises wages, you would get another tax cut. If you hire a veteran, you get a tax cut. Right now there's a small business in Ohio that does high-tech manufacturing, and they've been expanding for the past 2 years. They're considering hiring more, and this tax break would encourage them to do it.
Hundreds of thousands of teachers and firefighters and police officers have been laid off because of State budget cuts. This jobs bill has funding to put a lot of those men and women back to work. It has funding to prevent a lot more from losing their job. I had a chance to meet a young man named Robert Baroz. He's an English teacher in Boston who came to the White House a few weeks ago. He's got two decades of teaching experience; he's got a master's degree; he's got an outstanding track record of helping his students make huge gains in reading and writing. In the last few years, he's received three pink slips because of budget cuts. Why wouldn't we want to pass a bill that puts somebody like Robert back in the classroom teaching our kids?
Some of you were with me when we visited a bridge between Ohio and Kentucky that's been classified as functionally obsolete. That's a fancy way of saying it's old and breaking down. We've heard about bridges in both States that are falling apart, and that's true all across the country.
In Maine, there is a bridge that is in such bad shape that pieces of it were literally falling off the other day. And meanwhile, we've got millions of laid-off construction workers who could right now be busy rebuilding roads, rebuilding bridges, rebuilding schools. This jobs bill gives them a chance to get back to work rebuilding America. Why wouldn't we want that to happen? Why would you vote against that?
The proposals in this bill are not just random investments to create make-work jobs, they are steps we have to take if we want to build an economy that lasts, if we want to be able to compete with other countries for jobs that restore a sense of security to middle class families. And to do that, we've got to have the most educated workers. We have to have the best transportation and communications networks. We have to support innovative small businesses. We've got to support innovative manufacturers.
Now, what's true is we've also got to rein in our deficits and live within our means, which is why this jobs bill is fully paid for by asking millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share. And some see this as class warfare. I see it as a simple choice: We can either keep taxes exactly as they are for millionaires and billionaires, with loopholes that lead them to have lower tax rates in some cases than plumbers and teachers, or we can put teachers and construction workers and veterans back on the job.
We can fight to protect tax cuts for folks who don't need them and weren't asking for them, or we can cut taxes for virtually every worker and small business in America. But we can't afford to do both. That's the choice that's going to be before the Senate.
There are too many people hurting in this country for us to do nothing and the economy is just too fragile for us to let politics get in the way of action. We've got a responsibility to the people who sent us here. So I hope every Senator thinks long and hard about what's at stake when they cast their vote next week.
All right. With that, I will take your questions, and I will start with Ben Feller of Associated Press.
National Economy/Bipartisanship/Job Growth Legislation
Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I'd like to ask you about two economic matters. Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke warned Congress this week that the economic recovery is close to faltering. Do you agree?
And secondly, on your jobs bill, the American people are sick of games, and you mentioned games in your comments. They want results. Wouldn't it be more productive to work with Republicans on a plan that you know could pass Congress as opposed to going around the country talking about your bill and singling out--calling out Republicans by name?
The President. Well, first of all, with respect to the state of the economy, there is no doubt that growth has slowed. I think people were much more optimistic at the beginning of this year. But the combination of a Japanese tsunami, the Arab Spring, which drove up gas prices, and most prominently, Europe, I think, has gotten businesses and consumers very nervous. And we did not help here in Washington with the debt ceiling debacle that took place, a bit of game-playing that was completely unnecessary, completely unprecedented in terms of how we dealt with our responsibilities here in Washington.
You combine all that, there is no doubt that the economy is weaker now than it was at the beginning of the year. And every independent economist who has looked at this question carefully believes that for us to make sure that we are taking out an insurance policy against a possible double-dip recession, it is important for us to make sure that we are boosting consumer confidence, putting money into their pockets, cutting taxes where we can for small businesses, and that it makes sense for us to put people back to work doing the work that needs to be done. That's exactly what this jobs bill does.
Now, with respect to working with Congress, I think it's fair to say that I have gone out of my way in every instance, sometimes at my own political peril and to the frustration of Democrats, to work with Republicans to find common ground to move this country forward, in every instance, whether it was during the lame duck session, when we were able to get an agreement on making sure that the payroll tax was cut in the first place and making sure that unemployment insurance was extended, to my constant efforts during the debt ceiling to try to get what's been called a grand bargain in which we had a balanced approach to actually bringing down our deficit and debt in a way that wouldn't hurt our recovery.
Each time, what we've seen is games-playing, a preference to try to score political points rather than actually get something done on the part of the other side. And that has been true not just over the last 6 months; that's been true over the last 2½ years.
Now, the bottom line is this: Our doors are open. And what I've done over the last several weeks is to take the case to the American people so that they understand what's at stake. It is now up to all the Senators and, hopefully, all the Members of the House to explain to their constituencies why they would be opposed to commonsense ideas that historically have been supported by Democrats and Republicans in the past. Why would you be opposed to tax cuts for small businesses and tax cuts for American workers?
My understanding is that for the last decade, they've been saying we need to lower taxes for folks. Well, why wouldn't we want to do that through this jobs bill? We know that we've got roads and bridges and schools that need to be rebuilt. And historically, Republicans haven't been opposed to rebuilding roads and bridges. Why would you be opposed now?
We know that the biggest problem that we've had in terms of unemployment over the last several months has not been in the private sector, it's actually been layoffs of teachers and cops and firefighters. We've created over 2 million jobs in the private sector--a million jobs this year alone in the private sector--but in the public sector, we keep on seeing these layoffs having an adverse effect on economies in States all across the country. Why wouldn't we want to make sure that those teachers are in the classroom teaching our kids?
So here's the bottom line: My expectation and hope is that everybody will vote for this jobs bill because it reflects those ideas that traditionally have been supported by both Democrats and Republicans. If it turns out that there are Republicans who are opposed to this bill, they need to explain to me, but more importantly, to their constituencies and the American people, why they're opposed and what would they do.
We know that this jobs bill, based on independent analysis, could grow the economy almost an additional 2 percent. That could mean an additional 1.9 million jobs. Do they have a plan that would have a similar impact? Because if they do, I'm happy to hear it. But I haven't heard them offer alternatives that would have that same kind of impact, and that's what we need right now.
A lot of the problems that this economy is facing are problems that predate the financial crisis: middle class families seeing their wages and their incomes flat despite rising costs for everything from health care to a college education. And so folks have been struggling not just for the last 3 years, they've been struggling for over a decade now. And at a time when so many people are having such a hard time, we have to have an approach, we have to take action, that is big enough to meet the moment. And what I've heard from Republicans is, well, we're agreeing to do these trade bills. That's great. I'm in favor of those trade bills, and I'm glad they're passing, but that's not going to do enough to deal with the huge problems we have right now with respect to unemployment.
We passed patent legislation. That was bipartisan work. I'm thrilled that I was--we were able to get Republicans and Democrats to work together on that. But that is a long-term issue for our economic competitiveness. It's not putting Americans to work right now.
So the bottom line is this, Ben: If next week Senators have additional ideas that will put people back to work right now and meet the challenges of the current economy, we are happy to consider them. But every idea that we put forward are ones that traditionally have been supported by Democrats and Republicans alike. And I think it's important for us to have a vote on those ideas, because I believe that it's very hard to argue against them.
And if Mr. McConnell chooses to vote against it or if members of his caucus choose to vote against it, I promise you we're going to keep on going and we will put forward maybe piece by piece each component of the bill. And each time they're going to have to explain why it is that they'd be opposed to putting teachers back in the classroom or rebuilding our schools or giving tax cuts to middle class folks and giving tax cuts to small businesses.
National Economy
Q. Do you think the recovery is close to faltering?
The President. I think that if we don't take action, then we could end up having more significant problems than we have right now. And some of it is just simple math. The payroll tax cut that we passed is set to expire. The jobs plan includes an extension of the payroll tax cut.
Now, if that is not extended, then that is over $1,000 out of the pockets of the average American family at a time when they're already feeling a severe pinch. That means they're going to be spending less. That means businesses are going to have less customers. And that's going to have an adverse effect on an economy that is already weaker than it should be.
Okay. Chuck Todd [NBC News].
Job Growth Legislation/Tax Reform
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Before I get to my question, do we assume by how you're talking about the bill in the Senate that you are okay with the change in how to pay for it, the surtax--the 5.6-percent surtax on millionaires?
The President. We've always said that we would be open to a variety of ways to pay for it. We put forward what we thought was a solid approach to paying for the jobs bill itself. Keep in mind, though, that what I've always said is that not only do we have to pay for the jobs bill, but we also still have to do more in order to reduce the debt and deficit.
So the approach that the Senate is taking I'm comfortable with in order to deal with the jobs bill. We're still going to need to reform this Tax Code to make sure that we're closing loopholes, closing special interest tax breaks, making sure that the very simple principle, what we call the Buffett rule, which is that millionaires and billionaires aren't paying lower tax rates than ordinary families, that that's in place. So there's going to be more work to do with respect to making our tax system fair and just and promoting growth. But in terms of the immediate action of getting this jobs bill passed, I'm fine with the approach that they're taking.
Public Discontent With Political Process/Job Growth Legislation
Q. My question has to do with your powers of persuasion. During the debt ceiling debate, you asked for the American public to call Members of Congress, and switchboards got jammed. You have done a similar thing while going around the country doing this. Talking to Members of Congress, there's not the same reaction; you're not seeing--hearing about phones being jammed. Talking to one Member of Congress, he told me there's a disillusionment he's concerned about with the public that maybe they just don't believe anything can get done anyway. Are you worried about your own powers of persuasion and maybe that the American public is not listening to you anymore?
The President. Well, no. What we've seen is the American people respond very enthusiastically to the specific provisions of the jobs bill. They are very skeptical about Congress's ability to act right now, and that's understandable. The American people are very frustrated. They've been frustrated for a long time. They don't get a sense that folks in this town are looking out for their interests. They get a sense that folks in this town are thinking about their own jobs, their own careers, their own advancement, their party interests. And so if the question is, Chuck, are people feeling cynical and frustrated about the prospects of positive action in this city? Absolutely. And I can go out there and make speeches, but until they actually see action, some of that cynicism is going to be there.
As you said, during the debt ceiling debate, a very solid majority, I think maybe even higher than 70 percent, agreed with the approach that I talked about, which was we should have a balanced approach to deficit reduction.
And what the American people saw is that Congress didn't care, not just what I thought, they didn't care about what the American people thought. They had their own agenda. And so if they see that over and over again, that cynicism is not going to be reduced until Congress actually proves their cynicism wrong by doing something that would actually help the American people. This is a great opportunity to do it. This is a great opportunity to do it.
And keep in mind, if the American jobs bill passes, we're still going to have challenges. We're still going to have to make sure that we've got the best education system in the world because that is going to be critical for our long-term competitiveness and creating good, solid middle class jobs. We're still going to have to keep investing in basic research and science. We're still going to have to make sure that we do even more on infrastructure. I mean, what's contained in the American jobs bill doesn't cover all the roads and bridges and infrastructure that needs to be improved around the country.
So there--so it's not as if that's going to solve all our problems, but it is an important start that we know would end up growing the economy and putting hundreds of thousands, millions of people back to work at a time when they need it the most. And it's paid for.
The one persuasive argument that the Republicans previously had made against a bill like this is the deficit is growing, we can't afford it. Well, we can afford it if we're willing to ask people like me to do a little bit more in taxes. We can afford it without affecting our deficit. Our proposal is paid for. So that can't be the excuse.
And so yes, until they see Congress actually putting country ahead of party politics and partisanship, they're going to be skeptical. And it doesn't matter how many times I preach to them, this is not a reflection of their lack of faith in the American jobs bill. They haven't seen Congress able to come together and act.
This is a good opportunity, though.
Q. [Inaudible]--disillusionment?
The President. What we've seen is, is that they agree with what we've put forward. Now, here's what I'll also say, is that based on the debt ceiling vote, what they've seen is that the Republicans in Congress, even when the American people agree with me, oftentimes will vote against something I'm proposing.
So there may be some skepticism that I personally can persuade Republicans to take actions in the interest of the American people. But that's exactly why I need the American people to try to put some pressure on them. Because I think, justifiably, what they've seen is that oftentimes, even ideas that used to be supported by Republicans, if I'm proposing them, suddenly, Republicans forget it, and they decide they're against it.
Jackie [Jackie Calmes, New York Times].
U.S. Financial System/Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. As you travel the country, you also take credit for tightening regulations on Wall Street through the Dodd-Frank law and about your efforts to combat income inequality. There's this movement--Occupy Wall Street--which has spread from Wall Street to other cities. They clearly don't think that you or Republicans have done enough, that you're, in fact, part of the problem.
Are you following this movement, and what would you say to its--people that are attracted to it?
The President. Obviously, I've heard of it. I've seen it on television. I think it expresses the frustrations that the American people feel, that we had the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression, huge collateral damage all throughout the country, all across Main Street, and yet you're still seeing some of the same folks who acted irresponsibly trying to fight efforts to crack down on abusive practices that got us into this problem in the first place.
So yes, I think people are frustrated and the protestors are giving voice to a more broad-based frustration about how our financial system works. Now, keep in mind, I have said before and I will continue to repeat, we have to have a strong, effective financial sector in order for us to grow. And I used up a lot of political capital, and I've got the dings and bruises to prove it, in order to make sure that we prevented a financial meltdown and that banks stayed afloat. And that was the right thing to do, because had we seen a financial collapse then the damage to the American economy would have been even worse.
But what I've also said is that for us to have a healthy financial system, that requires that banks and other financial institutions compete on the basis of the best service and the best products and the best price, and it can't be competing on the basis of hidden fees, deceptive practices, or derivative cocktails that nobody understands and that expose the entire economy to enormous risks. And that's what Dodd-Frank was designed to do. It was designed to make sure that we didn't have the necessity of taxpayer bailouts. That we said, you know what? We're going to be able to control these situations so that if these guys get into trouble, we can isolate them, quarantine them, and let them fail. It says that we're going to have a consumer watchdog on the job all the time who's going to make sure that they are dealing with customers in a fair way and we're eliminating hidden fees on credit cards and mortgage brokers are going to have to--actually have to be straight with people about what they're purchasing.
And what we've seen over the last year is not only did the financial sector, with the Republican Party in Congress, fight us every inch of the way, but now you've got these same folks suggesting that we should roll back all those reforms and go back to the way it was before the crisis. Today, my understanding is, we're going to have a hearing on Richard Cordray, who is my nominee to head up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. He would be America's chief consumer watchdog when it comes to financial products. Now, this is a guy who is well regarded in his home State of Ohio, has been the treasurer of Ohio, the attorney general of Ohio. Republicans and Democrats in Ohio all say that he is a serious person who looks out for consumers. He has a good reputation. And Republicans have threatened not to confirm him not because of anything he's done, but because they want to roll back the whole notion of having a consumer watchdog.
You've got Republican Presidential candidates whose main economic policy proposals is, we'll get rid of the financial reforms that are designed to prevent the abuses that got us into this mess in the first place. That does not make sense to the American people. They are frustrated by it. And they will continue to be frustrated by it until they get a sense that everybody is playing by the same set of rules and that you're rewarded for responsibility and doing the right thing as opposed to gaming the system.
So I'm going to be fighting every inch of the way here in Washington to make sure that we have a consumer watchdog that is preventing abusive practices by the financial sector.
I will be hugely supportive of banks and financial institutions that are doing the right thing by their customers. We need them to be lending. We need them to be lending more to small businesses. We need them to help do what traditionally banks and financial services are supposed to be doing, which is providing business and families resources to make productive investments that will actually build the economy. But until the American people see that happening, yes, they are going to continue to express frustrations about what they see as two sets of rules.
Discontent With U.S. Financial System
Q. Do you think Occupy Wall Street has the potential to be a Tea Party movement in 2012?
The President. What I think is that the American people understand that not everybody has been following the rules, that Wall Street is an example of that, that folks who are working hard every single day, getting up, going to the job, loyal to their companies, that that used to be the essence of the American Dream. That's how you got ahead--the old-fashioned way. And these days, a lot of folks who are doing the right thing aren't rewarded, and a lot of folks who aren't doing the right thing are rewarded.
And that's going to express itself politically in 2012 and beyond until people feel like once again we're getting back to some old-fashioned American values in which, if you're a banker, then you are making your money by making prudent loans to businesses and individuals to build plants and equipment and hire workers that are creating goods and products that are building the economy and benefiting everybody.
Jake Tapper [ABC News].
U.S. Financial System/Department of Energy Loan Guarantee Program/Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives ""Fast and Furious"" Program
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Just to follow up on Jackie's question. One of the reasons why so many of the people of the Occupy Wall Street protests are so angry is because, as you say, so many people on Wall Street did not follow the rules, but your administration hasn't really been very aggressive in prosecuting. In fact, I don't think any Wall Street executives have gone to jail despite the rampant corruption and malfeasance that did take place. So I was wondering if you'd comment on that.
And then just as a separate question, as you're watching the Solyndra and ""Fast and Furious"" controversies play out, I'm wondering if it gives you any pause about any of the decisionmaking going on in your administration: some of the e-mails that Democrats put out indicating that people at the Office of Management and Budget were concerned about the Department of Energy; some of the e-mails going on with the Attorney General saying he didn't know about the details of ""Fast and Furious."" Are you worried at all about how this is--how your administration is running?
The President. Well, first on the issue of prosecutions on Wall Street, one of the biggest problems about the collapse of Lehmans and the subsequent financial crisis and the whole subprime lending fiasco is that a lot of that stuff wasn't necessarily illegal, it was just immoral or inappropriate or reckless. That's exactly why we needed to pass Dodd-Frank, to prohibit some of these practices.
The financial sector is very creative, and they are always looking for ways to make money. That's their job. And if there are loopholes and rules that can be bent and arbitrage to be had, they will take advantage of it. So without commenting on particular prosecutions--obviously, that's not my job, that's the Attorney General's job--I think part of people's frustrations, part of my frustration, was a lot of practices that should not have been allowed weren't necessarily against the law, but they had a huge destructive impact. And that's why it was important for us to put in place financial rules that protect the American people from reckless decisionmaking and irresponsible behavior.
Now, with respect to Solyndra and ""Fast and Furious,"" I think I've been very clear that I have complete confidence in Attorney General Holder in how he handles his office. He has been very aggressive in going after gun running and cash transactions that are going to these transnational drug cartels in Mexico. There has been a lot of cooperation between the United States and Mexico on this front. He's indicated that he was not aware of what was happening in ""Fast and Furious."" Certainly, I was not. And I think both he and I would have been very unhappy if somebody had suggested that guns were allowed to pass through that could have been prevented by the United States of America.
He has assigned an Inspector General to look into how exactly this happened, and I have complete confidence in him and I've got complete confidence in the process to figure out who, in fact, was responsible for that decision and how it got made.
Solyndra, this is a loan guarantee program that predates me that historically has had support from Democrats and Republicans as well. And the idea is pretty straightforward: If we are going to be able to compete in the 21st century, then we've got to dominate cutting-edge technologies, we've got to dominate cutting-edge manufacturing. Clean energy is part of that package of technologies of the future that have to be based here in the United States if we're going to be able to succeed.
Now, the loan guarantee program is designed to meet a particular need in the marketplace, which is, a lot of these small startups, they can get angel investors, they can get several million dollars to get a company going, but it's very hard for them to then scale up, particularly if these are new cutting-edge technologies. It's hard for them to find private investors. And part of what's happening is China and Europe, other countries, are putting enormous subsidies into these companies and giving them incentives to move offshore. Even if the technology was developed in the United States, they end up going to China because the Chinese Government will say, we're going to help you get started. We'll help you scale up. We'll give you low-interest loans or no-interest loans. We will give siting. We will do whatever it takes for you to get started here.
And that's part of the reason why a lot of technologies that developed here, we've now lost the lead in: solar energy, wind energy. And so what the loan guarantee program was designed to do was to close that gap and say, let's see if we can help some of those folks locate here and create jobs here in the United States.
Now, we knew from the start that the loan guarantee program was going to entail some risk, by definition. If it was a risk-free proposition, then we wouldn't have to worry about it. But the overall portfolio has been successful. It has all","owed us to help companies, for example, start advanced battery manufacturing here in the United States. It's helped to create jobs. There were going to be some companies that did not work out; Solyndra was one of them. But the process by which the decision was made was on the merits. It was straightforward. And of course, there were going to be debates internally when you're dealing with something as complicated as this.
But I have confidence that the decisions were made based on what would be good for the American economy and the American people and putting people back to work.
And by the way, let me make one last point about this. I heard there was a Republican Member of Congress who's engaging in oversight on this, and despite the fact that all of them in the past have been supportive of this loan guarantee program, he concluded, you know what, we can't compete against China when it comes to solar energy. Well, you know what, I don't buy that. I'm not going to surrender to other countries' technological leads that could end up determining whether or not we're building a strong middle class in this country. And so we're going to have to keep on pushing hard to make sure that manufacturing is located here, new businesses are located here, and new technologies are developed here. And there are going to be times where it doesn't work out, but I'm not going to cave to the competition when they are heavily subsidizing all these industries.
U.S. Financial System
Q. Just a follow-up on Wall Street. Are you satisfied with how aggressive your administration has been when it comes to prosecuting? Because I know a lot of it was legal, but a lot of was not. There was fraud that took place.
The President. Right. Well, let me say this: The President can't go around saying, prosecute somebody. But as a general principle, if somebody is engaged in fraudulent actions, they need to be prosecuted. If they violated laws on the books, they need to be prosecuted. And that's the Attorney General's job, and I know that Attorney General Holder, U.S. attorneys all across the country, they take that job very seriously. Okay?

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You just spoke of the need for banks to start lending, you talked earlier about how creative they can be in chasing profit, and yet earlier in the week, you said that banks don't have some inherent right to just, you know, get a certain amount of profit. You also said in that interview that you can stop them. How do you plan on stopping them from charging this $5 fee or whatever the fee is? And do you think that your Government has a right to dictate how much profits American companies make?
The President. I absolutely do not think that. I was trying to make a broader point, which is that people have been using financial regulation as an excuse to charge consumers more. Right? I mean, basically the argument they've made is, well, you know what, this hidden fee was prohibited, and so we'll find another fee to make up for it. Now, they have that right, but it's not a good practice. It's not necessarily fair to consumers. And my main goal is to make sure that we've got a consumer watchdog in place who is letting consumers know what fair practices are, making sure that transactions are transparent, and making sure that banks have to compete for customers based on the quality of their service and good prices.
Now, the frustrating thing that we have right now is that you've got folks over in Congress, Republicans, who have said that they see their role as eliminating any prohibitions on any practices for financial companies. And I think that's part of the frustration that the American people feel, because they've just gone through a period in which they were seeing a bunch of hidden fees, rate hikes that they didn't know about, fine print that they could not understand. That's true for credit cards. That's true for mortgages. It contributed to overall weakness in the economy.
And yes, I think it is entirely appropriate for the Government to have some oversight role to make sure that consumers are protected. So banks--and any business in America--can price their products any way they want. That's how the free market works. As long as there's transparency and accountability and consumers understand what they're getting. And there are going to be instances where a policy judgment is made that, you know what, there are certain practices that just aren't fair. And that's how the market has always operated.
Q. So is it your understanding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can't actually prevent the debit card fees from going in place, like the ones that are being discussed--
The President. I think that what the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau could do is to make sure that consumers understood exactly what they were getting, exactly what was happening. And I think that Congress could make determinations with respect to whether or not a certain practice was fair or not. Okay?
David Nakamura [Washington Post].
Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources and Technologies
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Just following up on Jake's question about Solyndra. The loan program--guaranteed loan program that you talked about was giving out $38 billion in guaranteed loans and promised to save or create 65,000 jobs, green jobs, in clean energy, and there's been reports that actually only 3,500 new jobs have been created in that industry. Why has that industry been so slow to respond to the investment that your administration has provided? And what do you see going forward as to how it will respond?
The President. Well, I think that what has been true historically is that businesses that rely on new technologies, often--a lot of times it's going to take a while before they get takeoff. And there are a lot of upfront investments that have to be made in research and capital and so forth, a lot of barriers for companies that are trying to break in. Keep in mind that clean energy companies are competing against traditional energy companies. And traditional energy is still cheaper in a lot of ways.
The problem is, is it's running out, it's polluting, and we know that demand is going to keep on increasing so that if we don't prepare now, if we don't invest now, if we don't get on top of technologies now, we're going to be facing 20 years from now China and India having a billion new drivers on the road, the trendlines in terms of oil prices, coal, et cetera, going up, the impact on the planet increasing. And we're not just going to be able to start when all heck is breaking loose and say, boy, we better find some new energy sources.
So in the meantime, we've got to make these investments, but that makes it more difficult for a lot of these companies to succeed. What's also a problem, as I said, is that other countries are subsidizing these industries much more aggressively than we are. Hundreds of billions of dollars the Chinese Government is pouring into the clean energy sector, partly because they're projecting what's going to happen 10 or 20 years from now.
So look, I have confidence in American businesses and American technology and American scientists and entrepreneurs being able to win that competition. We are not going to be duplicating the kind of system that they have in China where they are basically state-run banks giving money to state-run companies and ignoring losses and ignoring bad management. But there is a role to play for us to make sure that these companies can at least have a fighting shot. And it does mean that there are going to be some that aren't successful, and it's going to be an uphill climb for some. And obviously, it's very difficult for all companies right now to succeed when the economy is as soft and as weak as it.
Department of Energy Loan Guarantee Program
Q. There have been reports with Solyndra in particular that investors warned your administration that the Government--that loan of $500 million in that company might not be a wise use of taxpayers' money. In retrospect, do you think your administration was so eager for Solyndra to succeed that it missed some of the critical warnings?
The President. I will tell you that even for those projects under this loan guarantee program that have ended up being successful, there are those in the marketplace who have been doubtful. So, I mean, there's always going to be a debate about whether this particular approach to this particular technology is going to be successful or not.
And all I can say is that the Department of Energy made these decisions based on their best judgment about what would make sense. And the nature of these programs are going to be ones in which for every success there may be one that does not work out as well. But that's exactly what the loan guarantee program was designed by Congress to do, was to take bets on these areas where we need to make sure that we're maintaining our lead. Okay?
Bill Plante [CBS News].
Bipartisanship/Job Growth Legislation
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Anybody on Capitol Hill will say that there's no chance that the ""American Jobs Act,"" in its current state, passes either House. And you've been out on the campaign trail banging away at them saying, pass this bill. And it begins, sir, to look like you're campaigning and like you're following the Harry Truman model against the do-nothing Congress instead of negotiating. Are you negotiating? Will you?
The President. I am always open to negotiations. What is also true is they need to do something. I'm not--look, the--Bill, I think it is very clear that if Members of Congress come in and say, ""All right, we want to build infrastructure, here's the way we think we can do it; we want to put construction workers back to work, we've got some ideas,"" I am ready, eager to work with them. They say, ""We've got this great idea for putting teachers back in the classroom; it's a little different than what you've proposed in the jobs bill."" I'm ready, eager to work with them. But that's not what we're hearing right now. I mean, what we're hearing is that their big ideas, the ones that make sense, are ones we're already doing.
They've given me a list of, well, here's the Republican job creation ideas: Let's pass free trade agreements. It's great that we're passing these free trade agreements. We put them forward; I expect bipartisan support. I think it's going to be good for the American economy. But it's not going to meet the challenge of 9-percent unemployment or an economy that is currently weakening. It's not enough.
Patent reform, very important for our long-term competitiveness. There's nobody out there who actually thinks that that's going to immediately fill the needs of people who are out of work or strengthen the economy right now.
So what I've tried to do is say, here are the best ideas I've heard. Not just from partisans, but from independent economists. These are the ideas most likely to create jobs now and strengthen the economy right now. And that's what the American people are looking for. And the response from Republicans has been, no, although they haven't given a good reason why they're opposed to putting construction workers back on the job or teachers back in the classroom.
If you ask them, well, okay, if you're not for that, what are you for? Trade has already been done; patent reform has been done. What else? The answer we're getting right now is, well, we're going to roll back all these Obama regulations. So their big economic plan to put people back to work right now is to roll back financial protections and allow banks to charge hidden fees on credit cards again or weaken consumer watchdogs. Or alternatively, they've said we'll roll back regulations that make sure we've got clean air and clean water, eliminate the EPA. Does anybody really think that that is going to create jobs right now and meet the challenges of a global economy that are--that is weakening with all these forces coming into play?
I mean, here is a good question, here's a little homework assignment for folks: Go ask the Republicans what their jobs plan is, if they're opposed to the ""American Jobs Act,"" and have it scored, have it assessed by the same independent economists that have assessed our jobs plan. These independent economists say that we could grow the economy as much as 2 percent and as many as 1.9 million workers would be back on the job. I think it would be interesting to have them do a similar assessment--same people. Some of these folks, by the way, traditionally have worked for Republicans, not just Democrats. Have those economists evaluate what, over the next 2 years, the Republican jobs plan would do. I'll be interested in the answer. I think everybody here--I see some smirks in the audience because you know that it's not going to be real robust.
And so, Bill, the question, then, is, will Congress do something? If Congress does something, then I can't run against a do-nothing Congress. If Congress does nothing, then it's not a matter of me running against them; I think the American people will run them out of town because they are frustrated, and they know we need to do something big and something bold.
Now, the American people are also concerned about making sure that we have a Government that lives within its means, which is why I put forward a plan that would also reduce our deficit and our debt in a more aggressive way than what the special committee has been charged with.
Folks want to talk about corporate tax reform. I've already said I'm happy to engage with them on corporate tax reform. I'm happy to engage with them, working to see what we can do to streamline and simplify our Tax Code, eliminate all the loopholes, eliminate these special interest carve-outs and potentially lower rates in the process while raising more revenue.
I am happy to negotiate with them on a whole host of issues, but right now we've got an emergency. And the American people are living that emergency out every single day, and they have been for a long time. They are working really hard. And if they're not on the job, then they're working really hard to find a job. And they're losing their homes, and their kids are having to drop out of school because they can't afford student loans. And they're putting off visiting a doctor because when they lost their job they lost their health insurance. They are struggling.
And as a consequence, by the way, all of us are struggling, even those who are well off. The irony is the same folks that the Republicans claim to be protecting, the well off--the millionaires and the billionaires--they'd be doing better, they'd be making more money if ordinary Americans had some money in their pockets and were out there feeling more confident about the economy. That's been the lesson of our history: When folks in the middle and at the bottom are doing well, the folks at the top do even better.
U.S. Political System/Bipartisanship
Q. Is this kind of public pressure the only leverage you have, sir?
The President. Look, we have a democracy. And right now John Boehner is the Speaker of the House and Mitch McConnell is the Republican leader. And all I can do is make the best arguments and mobilize the American people so that they're responsive.
So far they haven't been responsive to not just me, but public opinion. We saw that during the debt ceiling vote. But we're just going to keep on making the case. But I guess what I'm saying, though, here, Bill, is--and I said this when I made my speech at the joint session--the election is 13, 14 months away. I would love nothing more than to not have to be out there campaigning because we were seeing constructive action here in Congress. That's my goal. That's what I'm looking for.
But I'm also dealing with a Republican majority leader who said that his number-one goal was to beat me, not put Americans back to work, not grow the economy, not help small businesses expand, but to defeat me. And he's been saying that now for a couple of years. So yes, I've got to go out and enlist the American people to see if maybe he'll listen to them if he's not listening to me.
Matt Spetalnick [Reuters]. Where's Matt? There we are.
China/Trade
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. One question on the economy and one on foreign policy. First of all, the Senate has taken up today a bill aimed at pressuring China to let its currency rise. What's your position on that bill? Would you veto or sign it, should it hit your desk?
On the foreign policy front, do you agree with Admiral Mullen's accusation that Pakistan's intelligence agency has used the Haqqani network as a virtual arm? And what, if any, consequences, up to and including a cutoff of aid, would you be willing to consider?
The President. Obviously, we've been seeing a remarkable transformation of China over the last two decades, and it's helped to lift millions of people out of poverty in China. We have stabilized our relationship with China in a healthy way. But what is also true is that China has been very aggressive in gaming the trading system to its advantage and to the disadvantage of other countries, particularly the United States. And I have said that publicly, but I've also said it privately to Chinese leaders. And currency manipulation is one example of it, or at least intervening in the currency markets in ways that have led their currency to be valued lower than the market would normally dictate. And that makes their exports cheaper, and that makes our exports to them more expensive. So we've seen some improvement, some slight appreciation over the last year, but it's not enough.
It's not just currency, though. We've also seen, for example, intellectual property, technologies that were created by U.S. companies with a lot of investment, a lot of upfront capital taken, not protected properly by Chinese firms. And we've pushed China on that issue as well.
Ultimately, I think that you can have a win-win trading relationship with China. I'm very pleased that we're going to be able to potentially get a trade deal with South Korea. But I believe what, I think, most Americans believe, which is trade is great as long as everybody is playing by the same rules.
Now, the legislation that is being presented in Congress is an effort to get at that. My main concern--and I've expressed this to Senator Schumer--is whatever tools we put in place, let's make sure that these are tools that can actually work, that they're consistent with our international treaties and obligations. I don't want a situation where we're just passing laws that are symbolic knowing that they're probably not going to be upheld by the World Trade Organization, for example, and then suddenly, U.S. companies are subject to a whole bunch of sanctions. We've got a--I think we've got a strong case to make, but we've just got to make sure that we do it in a way that's going to be effective.
Last point is, my administration has actually been more aggressive than any in recent years in going after some of these practices. We've brought very aggressive enforcement actions against China for violations in the tire case, for example, where it's been upheld by the World Trade Organization that they were engaging in unfair trading practices. And that's given companies here in the United States a lot of relief.
So my overall goal is, I believe U.S. companies, U.S. workers, we can compete with anybody in the world. I think we can make the best products. And a huge part of us winning the future, a huge part of rebuilding this economy on a firm basis that's not just reliant on maxed-out credit cards and a housing bubble and financial speculation, but is dependent on us making things and selling things. I am absolutely confident that we can win that competition. But in order to do it, we've got to make sure that we're aggressive in looking out for the interests of American workers and American businesses and that everybody is playing by the same rules and that we're not getting cheated in the process.
China/Pakistan/Afghanistan
Q. Is China--[inaudible]?
The President. That is a--that is a term of art, so the Treasury Secretary, I've got to be careful here--it's his job to make those decisions. But it's indisputable that they intervene heavily in the currency markets and that the RMB, their currency, is lower than it probably would be if they weren't making all those purchases in the currency markets to keep the RMB lower.
With respect to Pakistan, I have said that my number-one goal is to make sure that Al Qaida cannot attack the U.S. homeland and cannot affect U.S. interests around the world. And we have done an outstanding job, I think, in going after, directly, Al Qaida in this border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan. We could not have been as successful as we have been without the cooperation of the Pakistan Government. And so, on a whole range of issues, they have been an effective partner with us.
What is also true is that our goal of being able to transition out of Afghanistan and leave a stable Government behind--one that is independent, one that is respectful of human rights, one that is democratic--that Pakistan, I think, has been more ambivalent about some of our goals there. And I think that they have hedged their bets in terms of what Afghanistan would look like. And part of hedging their bets is having interactions with some of the unsavory characters who, they think, might end up regaining power in Afghanistan after coalition forces have left.
What we've tried to persuade Pakistan of is that it is in their interest to have a stable Afghanistan, that they should not be feeling threatened by a stable, independent Afghanistan. We've tried to get conversations between Afghans and Pakistans going more effectively than they have been in the past, but we've still got more work to do. And there is no doubt that there is some connections that the Pakistani military and intelligence services have with certain individuals that we find troubling. And I've said that publicly, and I've said it privately to Pakistani officials as well.
They see their security interests threatened by an independent Afghanistan in part because they think it will ally itself to India and Pakistan still considers India their mortal enemy. Part of what we want to do is actually get Pakistan to realize that a peaceful approach towards India would be in everybody's interests and would help Pakistan actually develop, because one of the biggest problems we have in Pakistan right now is poverty, illiteracy, a lack of development, civil institutions that aren't strong enough to deliver for the Pakistani people. And in that environment you've seen extremism grow. You've seen militancy grow that doesn't just threaten our efforts in Afghanistan, but also threatens the Pakistani Government and the Pakistani people as well. So trying to get that reorientation is something that we're continuing to work on; it's not easy.
Pakistan
Q. I'm sorry, sir--consequences of being--[inaudible]?
The President. We will constantly evaluate our relationship with Pakistan based on, is, overall, this helping to protect Americans and our interests? We have a great desire to help the Pakistani people strengthen their own society and their own Government. And so I'd be hesitant to punish aid for flood victims in Pakistan because of poor decisions by their intelligence services. But there is no doubt that we're not going to feel comfortable with a long-term strategic relationship with Pakistan if we don't think that they're mindful of our interest as well.
I'll make this the last question. Aamer Madhani [USA Today].
National Economy/Global Economic Stabilization
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Caught you by surprise, huh? [Laughter]
Q. You did. What should European leaders do to resolve the sovereign debt crisis going forward? And second, how risky is this continued situation to the U.S. economy? And finally, do you feel that the European leaders have been negligent in pushing austerity too soon?
The President. Those are good questions. The biggest headwind the American economy is facing right now is uncertainty about Europe because it's affecting global markets. The slowdown that we're seeing is not just happening here in the United States, it's happening everywhere. Even in some of the emerging markets like China, you're seeing greater caution, less investment, deep concern.
In some ways, as frustrating as the financial sector has been here in the United States after the Lehmans collapse, the aggressive actions that were taken right after Lehmans did help us to strengthen the financial sector and the banking sector in ways that the--Europe did not fully go through. And uncertainty around Greece and their ability to pay their debts, runs on--in the capital markets, on the debt that many of these southern European countries have been facing, as well as Ireland and Portugal, all that has put severe strain on the world financial system.
I speak frequently with Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy; they are mindful of these challenges. I think they want to act to prevent a sovereign debt crisis from spinning out of control or seeing the potential breakup of the euro. I think they're very committed to the European project.
But their politics is tough because, essentially, they've got to get agreement with not only their own parliaments; they've got to get agreement with 20 Parliaments or 24 Parliaments or 27 Parliaments. And engineering that kind of coordinated action is very difficult.
But what I've been seeing over the last month is a recognition by European leaders of the urgency of the situation. And nobody is obviously going to be affected more than they will be if the situation there spins out of control.
So I'm confident that they want to get this done. I think there are some technical issues that they're working on in terms of how they get a big enough--how do they get enough firepower to let the markets know that they're going to be standing behind euro members whose--who may be in a weaker position.
But they've got to act fast. And we've got a G-20 meeting coming up in November. My strong hope is that by the time of that G-20 meeting, that they have a very clear, concrete plan of action that is sufficient to the task. It will have an effect--it's already having an effect here in the United States; it will continue to have an effect on our economy because the world is now interconnected in ways that it's never been before.
And that's one of the biggest challenges that we have post-2008, after this financial crisis, is that America has always been--well, over the last 20 years--has been the engine for world economic growth. We were the purchasers of last resort, we were the importers of last resort, we would stimulate our economies, and our American consumers would buy stuff around the world. And so if they got into trouble, they could always say, well we're going to sell to the U.S.
Well, we're now going through a situation where families are cutting back and trying to reduce their debts, businesses are more cautious. And the U.S. Government obviously has its own fiscal challenges. I mean, we've got to make sure that we're living within our means, although we've got to do it gradually and not in ways that immediately affect a fragile economy.
So what that means is, Europe is not going to be able to export its way out of this problem. They're going to have to fix that problem. And part of the goal that I've been trying to promote for the last 2 years and I'll repeat at the G-20 is more balanced economic growth worldwide. We've got to get into a posture where the U.S. is always going to be a big market and we're going to welcome goods from all around the world, but we've also got to be selling goods around the world. We can't just be running up our debt in order to help other folks' economies. We've got to have--as not only families, our businesses, and our Government--we've got to make sure that we're being prudent and we're producing here in the United States. And by the way, that's what's going to create strong middle class jobs here in the United States.
I think part of what's going on for the country generally is this sense of, you know what, a lot of that debt that had been built up prior to 2008, that we were living on borrowed time because the underlying fundamentals of the economy weren't as strong as they needed to be.
And that's why not only do we have to put Americans back to work now, but we've also got to keep on reforming our education system so it's producing the highest skilled graduates in the world. It's why we've got to keep on investing in basic research and science. It's why we've got to make sure that we're rebuilding our infrastructure. It's why we've got to have a smarter energy policy, because that's a huge source of us having to import from other countries instead of being able to export to other countries.
All those things are going to be important, and all those things are going to be challenging. They're going to be hard. But right now we've got the problem of putting people back to work. That's why Congress needs to pass this jobs bill.
And last point I'll make: If Bill is right and everybody on Capitol Hill is cynical and saying there's no way that the overall jobs bill passes in its current form, we're just going to keep on going at it. I want everybody to be clear. My intention is to insist that each part of this, I want an explanation as to why we shouldn't be doing it, each component part: putting people back to work rebuilding our roads, putting teachers back in the classroom, tax cuts for small businesses and middle class families, tax breaks for our veterans. We will just keep on going at it and hammering away until something gets done. And I would love ","nothing more than to see Congress act so aggressively that I can't campaign against them as a do-nothing Congress.
All right? Thank you very much, everybody."

Good afternoon, everybody. Aloha. I want to begin by thanking the people of Hawaii for their extraordinarily hospitality. Usually when Michelle and I and our daughters come back to visit, it's just one President, and this time, we brought 21. So thank you so much for the incredible graciousness of the people of Hawaii and their patience, because I know that traffic got tied up a little bit.
Now, the single greatest challenge for the United States right now, and my highest priority as President, is creating jobs and putting Americans back to work. And one of the best ways to do that is to increase our trade and exports with other nations. Ninety-five percent of the world's consumers are beyond our borders. I want them to be buying goods with three words stamped on them: Made in America. So I've been doing everything I can to make sure that the United States is competing aggressively for the jobs and the markets of the future.
No region will do more to shape our long-term economic future than the Asia-Pacific region. As I've said, the United States is and always will be a Pacific nation. Many of our top trading partners are in this region. This is where we sell most of our exports, supporting some 5 million American jobs. And since this is the world's fastest growing region, the Asia-Pacific is key to achieving my goal of doubling U.S. exports, a goal, by the way, which we are on track right now to meet.
And that's why I've been proud to host APEC this year. It's been a chance to help lead the way towards a more seamless regional economy with more trade, more exports, and more jobs for our people. And I'm pleased that we've made progress in three very important areas.
First, we agreed to a series of steps that will increase trade and bring our economies even closer. We agreed to a new set of principles on innovation to encourage the entrepreneurship that creates new businesses and new industries. With simplified customs and exemptions from certain tariffs, we'll encourage more businesses to engage in more trade. And that includes our small businesses, which account for the vast majority of the companies in our economies.
We agreed to a new initiative that will make it easier and faster for people to travel and conduct business across the region. And yesterday I was pleased to sign legislation, a new travel card that will help our American business men and women travel more easily and get deals done in this region.
I'd note that we also made a lot of progress increasing trade on the sidelines of APEC. As I announced yesterday, the United States and our eight partners reached the broad outlines of an agreement on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And today I'm pleased that Japan, Canada, and Mexico have now expressed an interest in this effort.
This comes on the heels of our landmark trade agreements with South Korea, Panama, and Colombia, which will support tens of thousands of American jobs.
And in my meeting with President Medvedev, we discussed how to move ahead with Russia's accession to the WTO, which will also mean more exports for American manufacturers and American farmers and ranchers.
Second, APEC agreed on ways to promote the green growth we need for our energy security. We agreed to reduce tariffs on environmental goods and make it easier to export clean energy technologies that create green jobs. We raised the bar on ourselves, and we'll aim for even higher energy efficiencies. And we're moving ahead with the effort to phase out fossil fuel subsidies. This would be a huge step toward creating clean energy economies and fighting climate change, which is a threat to both the beauty and the prosperity of the region.
Third, we're redoubling our efforts to make sure that regulations are encouraging trade and job creation, not discouraging trade and job creation. And this builds on the work that we're doing in the United States to get rid of rules and regulations that are unjustified and that are overly burdensome. Our APEC partners are joining us in streamlining and coordinating regulations so that we're sparking innovation and growth even as we protect public health and our environment.
And finally, since many of the leaders here were also at the recent G-20 summit, we continued our efforts to get the global economy to grow faster. APEC makes up more than half the global economy, and it will continue to play a key role in achieving the strong and balanced growth that we need.
As I've said, as the world's largest economy, the best thing that the United States can do for the global economy is to grow our own economy faster. And so I will continue to fight for the ""American Jobs Act"" so that we can put our people back to work.
I was glad to see that Congress moved forward on one aspect of the jobs bill, tax credits for companies that are hiring veterans. But we've got to do a lot more than that.
So again, I want to thank the people of Hawaii for their extraordinary hospitality and for all that they've done to help make this summit such a success. I want to thank my fellow leaders for the seriousness and sense of common purpose that they brought to our work. And I believe that the progress we've made here will help create jobs and keep America competitive in a region that is absolutely vital not only for our economy, but also for our national security.
So with that, I'm going to take a few questions. I'll start with Ben Feller of AP [Associated Press].
Iran
Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I picked the side in the sun here, so--[laughter]. I'd like to ask you about Iran. Did you get any specific commitments from Russia or China on tightening sanctions? Did you move them at all? And do you fear the world is running out of options short of military intervention to keep Iran from getting nuclear weapons?
The President. One of the striking things over the last 3 years since I came into office is the degree of unity that we've been able to forge in the international community with respect to Iran. When I came into office, the world was divided and Iran was unified around its nuclear program. We now have a situation where the world is united and Iran is isolated. And because of our diplomacy and our efforts, we have, by far, the strongest sanctions on Iran that we've ever seen. And China and Russia were critical to making that happen. Had they not been willing to support those efforts in the United Nations, we would not be able to see the kind of progress that we've made.
And they're having an impact. All our intelligence indicates that Iran's economy is suffering as a consequence of this. And we're also seeing that Iran's influence in the region has ebbed, in part because their approach to repression inside of Iran is contrary to the Arab Spring that has been sweeping the Middle East.
So we are in a much stronger position now than we were 2 or 3 years ago with respect to Iran. Having said that, the recent IAEA report indicates what we already knew, which is, although Iran does not possess a nuclear weapon and is technically still allowing IAEA observers into their country, that they are engaging in a series of practices that are contrary to their international obligations and their IAEA obligations. And that's what the IAEA report indicated.
So what I did was to speak with President Medvedev, as well as President Hu, and all three of us entirely agree on the objective, which is making sure that Iran does not weaponize nuclear power and that we don't trigger a nuclear arms race in the region. That's in the interests of all of us.
In terms of how we move forward, we will be consulting with them carefully over the next several weeks to look at what other options we have available to us. The sanctions have enormous bite and enormous scope, and we're building off the platform that has already been established. The question is, are there additional measures that we can take. And we're going to explore every avenue to see if we can solve this issue diplomatically.
I have said repeatedly, and I will say today, we are not taking any options off the table, because it's my firm belief that an Iran with a nuclear weapon would pose a security threat not only to the region, but also to the United States. But our strong preference is to have Iran meet its international obligations, negotiate diplomatically, to allow them to have peaceful use of nuclear energy in accordance with international law, but at the same time, forswear the weaponization of nuclear power.
And so we're going to keep on pushing on that. And China and Russia have the same aims, the same objectives, and I believe that we'll continue to cooperate and collaborate closely on that issue.

Interrogation Techniques
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Last night at the Republican debate, some of the hopefuls--they hope to get your job--they defended the practice of waterboarding, which is a practice that you banned in 2009. Herman Cain said, quote, ""I don't see that as torture."" Michele Bachmann said that it's, quote, ""very effective."" So I'm wondering if you think that they're uninformed, out of touch, or irresponsible?
The President. That's a multiple-choice question, isn't it? [Laughter] Let me just say this: They're wrong. Waterboarding is torture. It's contrary to America's traditions. It's contrary to our ideals. That's not who we are. That's not how we operate. We don't need it in order to prosecute the war on terrorism. And we did the right thing by ending that practice.
If we want to lead around the world, part of our leadership is setting a good example. And anybody who has actually read about and understands the practice of waterboarding would say that that is torture. And that's not something we do, period.
Norah O'Donnell [CBS News].
Iran
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. If I could continue on that, the Republicans did have a debate on CBS last night. A lot of it was about foreign policy, and they were very critical of your record.
The President. That's shocking. [Laughter]
Q. So if I could get you to respond to something that Mitt Romney said. He said your biggest foreign policy failure is Iran. He said that if you are reelected, Iran will have a nuclear weapon. Is Mitt Romney wrong?
The President. I am going to make a practice of not commenting on whatever is said in Republican debates until they've got an actual nominee. But as I indicated to Ben in the earlier question, you take a look at what we've been able to accomplish in mobilizing the world community against Iran over the last 3 years, and it shows steady, determined, firm progress in isolating the Iranian regime and sending a clear message that the world believes it would be dangerous for them to have a nuclear weapon.
Now, is this an easy issue? No. Anybody who claims it is, is either politicking or doesn't know what they're talking about. But I think not only the world, but the Iranian regime understands very clearly how determined we are to prevent not only a nuclear Iran, but also a nuclear arms race in the region and a violation of nonproliferation norms that would have implications around the world, including in the Asia-Pacific region, where we have similar problems with North Korea.
David Nakamura [Washington Post].
China
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Yesterday, in a speech before business leaders, you said that you want China to play by the rules. And then your staff later said that, in a bilateral meeting with President Hu, that you expressed that American business leaders are growing frustrated with the pace of change in China's economy. What rules is China not playing by? What specific steps do you need to see from China? And what punitive actions is your administration willing to take, as you said it would yesterday, if China does not play by the rules?
The President. Well, first of all, I also said yesterday that we welcome the peaceful rise of China. It is in America's interests to see China succeed in lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. China can be a source of stability and help to underwrite international norms and codes of conduct.
And so what we've done over the last 2 years is to try to develop a frank, consistent, open relationship and dialogue with China, and it's yielded considerable benefits, for example, support for issues like Iran. But what I've also said to Chinese leadership since I came into office is that when it comes to their economic practices, there are a range of things that they have done that disadvantage not just the United States, but a whole host of their trading partners and countries in the region.
The most famous example is the issue of China's currency. Most economists estimate that the RMB is devalued by 20 to 25 percent. That means our exports to China are that much more expensive and their imports into the United States are that much cheaper. Now, there's been slight improvement over the last year, partly because of U.S. pressure, but it hasn't been enough. And it's time for them to go ahead and move towards a market-based system for their currency.
Now, we recognize they may not be able to do it overnight, but they can do it much more quickly than they've done it so far. And by the way, that would not necessarily be a bad thing for the Chinese economy, because they've been so focused on export-driven growth that they've neglected domestic consumption, building up domestic markets. It makes them much more vulnerable to shocks in the global economy. It throws the whole world economy out of balance because they're not buying as much as they could be from other countries.
And this is not something that's inconsistent with where Chinese leadership say they want to go. The problem is, is that you've got a bunch of export producers in China who like the system as it is and making changes are difficult for them politically. I get it. But the United States and other countries, I think understandably, feel that enough's enough.
That's not the only concern we have. Intellectual property rights and protections--companies that do business in China consistently report problems in terms of intellectual property not being protected. Now, that's particularly important for an advanced economy like ours, where that's one of our competitive advantages, is we've got great engineers, great entrepreneurs, we're designing extraordinary new products. And if they get no protection, and the next thing you know, China's operating as a low-cost producer and not paying any fees or revenues to folks who invented these products, that's a problem.
So those are two examples, but there are a number of others. These practices aren't secret. I think everybody understands that they've been going on for quite some time. Sometimes, American companies are wary about bringing them up because they don't want to be punished in terms of their ability to do business in China. But I don't have that same concern, so I bring it up.
And in terms of enforcement, the other thing that we've been doing is actually trying to enforce the trade laws that are in place. We've brought a number of cases. One that the U.S. press may be familiar with are the cases involving U.S. tires, where we brought very aggressive actions against China and won. And as a consequence, U.S. producers are in a better position, and that means more U.S. jobs.
So I think we can benefit from trade with China. And I want certainly to continue cultivating a constructive relationship with the Chinese Government, but we're going to continue to be firm in insisting that they operate by the same rules that everybody else operates under. We don't want them taking advantage of the United States or U.S. businesses.

Pennsylvania State University/Ensuring Institutions and Organizations Protect Vulnerable Segments of Society
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. The other day you told ESPN that the scandal at Penn State, which you said was heartbreaking, should prompt some soul-searching throughout the Nation. I'm wondering if you could elaborate on that, what exactly you meant and--I know you're a big fan of college sports--if this is something you think that is an indictment not just of what happened at Penn State, allegedly, but how athletics are revered in universities.
The President. Well, I think that's the kind of soul-searching that I was referring to, Jake. You're right, I'm a big college sports fan. I think that when it's kept in perspective, college athletics not only provides a great outlet for competition for our young people, but helps to build a sense of community and can help to brand a university in a way that is fun and important. But what happened at Penn State indicates that at a certain point, folks start thinking about systems and institutions and don't think about individuals. And when you think about how vulnerable kids are, for the alleged facts of that case to have taken place and for folks not to immediately say, nothing else matters except making sure those kids are protected, that's a problem.
It's not unique to a college sports environment. I mean, we've seen problems in other institutions that are equally heartbreaking. Not all of them involve children, by the way. I mean, there have been problems obviously with respect to sexual abuse or assault directed against women, where institutions sort of closed ranks instead of getting on top of it right away. And that's why I said I think all institutions, not just universities or sports programs, have to step back and take stock and make sure that we're doing everything we can to protect people who may be vulnerable in these circumstances, but also just keep in mind what's important: keeping in--making sure that our excitement about a college sports program doesn't get in the way of our basic human response when somebody's being hurt.
And it's been said that evil can thrive in the world just by good people standing by and doing nothing. And all of us, I think, have occasion where we see something that's wrong, we've got to make sure that we step up. That's true in college athletics. That's true in our Government. That's true everywhere.

China
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. In conversations that you've had over the past couple of days with the Asian-Pacific leaders, have any of them brought up the rhetoric that we're seeing from Republican Presidential candidates when it comes to China? And does that kind of rhetoric or posturing jeopardize the progress that your administration has made with China and the Asian-Pacific region as a whole?
The President. I think most leaders here understand that politics is not always measured or on the level, and so most of our discussions have to do with substance: How do we put our people back to work right now? How do we expand trade? How do we expand exports?
I've been very frank with Chinese leaders, though, in saying that the American people across the board--left, right, and center--believe in trade, believe in competition. We think we've got the best workers in the world. We think we've got the best universities, the best entrepreneurs, the best free market. We're ready to go out there and compete with anybody. But there is a concern across the political spectrum that the playing field is not level right now.
And so in conversations with President Hu and others, what I've tried to say is we have the opportunity to move in a direction in which this is a win-win: China is benefiting from trade with the United States; the United States is benefiting as well. Jobs are being created in the United States and not just in China. But right now things are out of kilter. And that is something that is shared across the board, as we saw with the recent vote on the Chinese currency issue in the Senate.
And I think leaders in the region understand that as China grows, as its economic influence expands, that the expectation is, is that they will be a responsible leader in the world economy, which is what the United States has tried to do. I mean, we try to set up rules that are universal, that everybody can follow, and then we play by those rules, and then we compete fiercely. But we don't try to game the system. That's part of what leadership's about.
China has the opportunity to be that same type of leader. And as the world's second largest economy, I think that's going to be important not just for this region, but for the world. But that requires them to take responsibility, to understand that their role is different now than it might have been 20 years ago or 30 years ago, where if they were breaking some rules, it didn't really matter, it did not have a significant impact. You weren't seeing huge trade imbalances that had consequences for the world financial system.
Now they've grown up, and so they're going to have to help manage this process in a responsible way.
Laura Meckler [Wall Street Journal].
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit/Group of Twenty Summit/U.S. Economy
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Why did you get rid of the aloha shirts and the grass skirts? [Laughter] Are you at all concerned that it not appear that you're having a party over here while so many people are living with such a tough economy? And I'm wondering if those perceptions were at all on your mind as you were making plans for this trip, which, by necessity, takes you to some pretty exotic and fun locations.
The President. Yes, I got rid of the Hawaiian shirts because I had looked at pictures of some of the previous APEC meetings and some of the garb that had appeared previously, and I thought this may be a tradition that we might want to break. I suggested to the leaders--we gave them a shirt, and if they wanted to wear the shirt, I promise you it would have been fine. But I didn't hear a lot of complaints about us breaking precedent on that one.
With respect to this trip, look, this is a pretty nice piece of scenery here, and I take enormous pride in having been raised in the State of Hawaii, but we're here for business. We're here to create jobs. We're here to promote exports. And we've got a set of tangible, concrete steps that have been taken that are going to make our economy stronger, and that's part of what our leadership has been about.
When I went to Europe last week, our job was to help shape a solution for the European crisis. And a lot of folks back home might have wondered, well, that's Europe's problem; why are we worrying about it? Well, if Europe has a major recession and the financial system in Europe starts spinning out of control, that will have a direct impact on U.S. growth and our ability to create jobs and people raising their living standards.
The same is true out here. If we're not playing out here in the world's largest regional economy and the world's fastest regional economy, if we've abandoned the field and we're not engaged, American businesses and--will lose out and those jobs won't be in the United States of America.
So part of my job is to make sure that the rules of the road are set up so that our folks can compete effectively. Part of my job is to sell America and our products and our services around the world, and I think we've done so very effectively.
And as I said, just to take the example of exports, we're on track to double our exports since I came into office. That was a goal I set, and we're on track to meet it. That's actually been one of the stronger parts of our economic growth over the last couple of years. And I want to make sure that we keep on driving that.
Chuck Todd [NBC News].
Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction/President Obama's Discussions With President Nicolas Sarkozy of France in Cannes, France/Middle East Peace Process
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. The Republican cochair of the supercommittee, Jeb Hensarling, went on TV today and said if the sequester happens--this idea of the automatic cuts in Medicare and defense--that there was plenty of motivation and plenty of votes to change the makeup of these automatic cuts.
I know you had a conversation with him about this and said that that was--changing it in any way was off the table. That means you're going to veto this bill, if that's the case, if it ends up they can't get a deal in the next 10 days.
And then, can you clarify your end of the ""hot mike"" conversation with French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as it involved Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu?
The President. Could I just say that Chuck's the only guy who asked two questions so far. So just--when I cut off here, whoever was next in the queue--[laughter]--I'm messing with you, Chuck.
With respect to the supercommittee, in August we negotiated to initiate a trillion dollars in cuts over the next 10 years, primarily out of discretionary spending, but we also said that in order for us to move towards a more stable fiscal condition that we're going to have to get an additional 1.2, minimum. I actually argued that we needed more than that. And the whole idea of the sequester was to make sure that both sides felt obligated to move off rigid positions and do what was required to help the country.
And since that time, they've had a lot of conversations, but it feels as if people continue to try to stick with their rigid positions rather than solve the problem.
Now, I've put forward a very detailed approach that would achieve $3 trillion-plus in savings. And it's the sort of balanced approach that the American people prefer. It says everything's on the table. We've got to have discretionary spending cuts of the sort we've already put in place. We've got to have nondefense cuts. We've got to have defense cuts. We're going to have to look at entitlement programs. We've got to reduce our health care costs. And we're going to need additional revenue.
And when we're talking about revenue, if we've got to raise money, it makes sense for us to start by asking the wealthiest among us to pay a little bit more before we start asking seniors, for example, to pay a lot more for their Medicare.
Now, this is the same presentation that I made to Speaker Boehner back in August. It's the same kind of balanced approach that every single independent committee that's looked at this has said needs to be done. And it just feels as if people keep on wanting to jigger the math so that they get a different outcome.
Well, the equation, no matter how you do it, is going to be the same. If you want a balanced approach that doesn't gut Medicare and Medicaid, doesn't prevent us from making investments in education and basic science and research--all the things we've been talking about here at APEC, that every world leader understands is the key for long-term economic success--then prudent cuts have to be matched up with revenue.
My hope is that over the next several days, the congressional leadership on the supercommittee go ahead and bite the bullet and do what needs to be done, because the math won't change. There's no magic formula. There are no magic beans that you can toss on the ground, and suddenly, a bunch of money grows on trees. We got to just go ahead and do the responsible thing. And I'm prepared to sign legislation that is balanced, that solves this problem.
One other thing that I want to say about this: When I meet with world leaders, what's striking--whether it's in Europe or here in Asia--the kinds of fundamental reforms and changes both on the revenue side and the public pension side that other countries are having to make are so much more significant than what we need to do in order to get our books in order.
This doesn't require radical changes to America or its way of life. It just means that we spread out the sacrifice across every sector so that it's fair, so that people don't feel as if once again people who are well connected, people who have lobbyists, special interests get off easy, and the burden is placed on middle class families that are already struggling. So if other countries can do it, we can do it, and we can do it in a responsible way.
I'm not going to comment on whether I'd veto a particular bill until I actually see a bill, because I still hold out the prospect that there's going to be a light-bulb moment where everybody says: ""Aha! Here's what we've got to do.""
With respect to the ""hot mike"" in France, I'm not going to comment on conversations that I have with individual leaders, but what I will say is this: The primary conversation I had with President Sarkozy in that meeting revolved around my significant disappointment that France had voted in favor of the Palestinians joining UNESCO, knowing full well that under our laws, that would require the United States cutting off funding to UNESCO, and after I had consistently made the argument that the only way we're going to solve the Middle East situation is if Palestinians and Israelis sit down at the table and negotiate, that it is not going to work to try to do an end run through the United Nations.
So I had a very frank and firm conversation with President Sarkozy about that issue. And that is consistent with both private and public statements that I've been making to everybody over the last several months.
Ed Henry [FOX News].
Job Growth
Q. Mr. President, I have three questions--[laughter]--starting with Mitt Romney. Just one question, I promise. [Laughter]
You started with a $447 billion jobs bill. Two months later, many speeches later, you've got virtually nothing from that. You've got the veterans jobs bill, which is important, obviously, and a lot of Executive orders. Are you coming to the realization that you may just get nothing here and go to the American people in 2012 without another jobs bill, 9-percent unemployment, and them wondering about your leadership, sir?
The President. Well, I think, first of all, the American people at this point are wondering about congressional leadership in failing to pass the jobs bill, the components of which th","e majority of Americans, including many Republicans, think are a good idea.
And that's part of the reason why the American people right now aren't feeling real good about Congress. Normally, by the way, the way politics works is if the overwhelming majority of the American people aren't happy with what you're doing, you start doing something different. So far that hasn't happened in Congress, and the Republicans in Congress, in particular. They don't seem to have that same sense of urgency about needing to put people back to work.
I'm going to keep on pushing. My expectation is, is that we will get some of it done now, and I'll keep on pushing until we get all of it done. And that may take me all the way till November to get it all done. And it may take a new Congress to get it all done. But the component parts--cutting taxes for middle class families, cutting taxes for small businesses that are hiring our veterans, hiring the long-term unemployed, put teachers back in the classroom--here in the State of Hawaii, you have a bunch of kids who are going to school 4 days a week because of budget problems. How are we going to win the competition in the 21st century with our kids going to school basically half time?
The jobs bill would help alleviate those budget pressures at the State level.
Rebuilding our infrastructure. Every world leader that you talk to, they're saying to themselves, how can we make sure we've got a first-class infrastructure? And as you travel through the Asia-Pacific region, you see China having better airports than us, Singapore having superior ports to ours. Well, that's going to impact our capacity to do business here, our capacity to trade, our capacity to get U.S. products made by U.S. workers into the fastest growing market in the world. And by the way, we could put a lot of people back to work at the same time.
So I'm going to keep on pushing. And my expectation is, is that we will just keep on chipping away at this. If you're asking me do I anticipate that the Republican leadership in the House or the Senate suddenly decide that I was right all along and they will adopt a hundred percent of my proposals, the answer is, no, I don't expect that. Do I anticipate that at some point they recognize that doing nothing is not an option? That's my hope. And that should be their hope too, because if they don't, I think we'll have a different set of leaders in Congress.
All right? Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you."
"November 16, 2011","The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Julia E. Gillard of Australia in Canberra, Australia",Barack Obama,"Barack Obama, The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Julia E. Gillard of Australia in Canberra, Australia Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/297532",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-julia-e-gillard-australia-canberra,"Prime Minister Gillard. Good evening, one and all. I take this opportunity to very warmly welcome President Obama to Australia for his first visit as President. President Obama is no stranger to our shores, having visited Australia before, but it is a special delight to have him here for his first visit as President. And it comes at an important time in our nation's history and in the history of our region.
We will be looking back during this visit. We'll be looking back at 60 years of the ANZUS alliance. We'll be looking back 10 years to the dreadful day of 9/11, a day we all remember with great sorrow. And we will be reflecting on those events. But we will be looking forward.
We live in the growing region of the world whose global--contribution to global growth is a profound one. We live in a region which is changing, changing in important ways. And as a result of those changes, President Obama and I have been discussing the best way of our militaries cooperating for the future.
So I'm very pleased to be able to announce with President Obama that we've agreed joint initiatives to enhance our alliance, 60 years old and being kept robust for tomorrow. It is a new agreement to expand the existing collaboration between the Australian Defence Force and the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Air Force. What this means in very practical detail is from mid-2012, Australia will welcome deployments of a company-sized rotation of 200 to 250 marines in the Northern Territory for around 6 months at a time.
Over a number of years, we intend to build on this relationship in a staged way to a full force of around 2,500 personnel. That is a full Marine Air Ground Task Force.
A second component of these initiatives, which we have agreed, is greater access by U.S. military aircraft to the Royal Australian Air Force facilities in our country's north. This will involve more frequent movements of U.S. military aircraft into and out of northern Australia. Now, taken together, these two initiatives make our alliance stronger, they strengthen our cooperation in our region.
We are a region that is growing economically. But stability is important for economic growth too. And our alliance has been a bedrock of stability in our region. So building on our alliance through this new initiative is about stability. It will be good for our Australian Defence Force to increase their capabilities by joint training, combined training, with the U.S. Marines and personnel. It will mean that we are postured to better respond together, along with other partners in the Asia-Pacific, to any regional contingency, including the provision of humanitarian assistance and dealing with natural disasters.
In addition to discussing this global force posture review by the United States and these new initiatives in our alliance, the President of the United States and I have had an opportunity to reflect on a number of other issues: to reflect on circumstances in the global economy, to reflect on a clean energy future for our nations and for our planet, to reflect on the forthcoming East Asia Summit. President Obama will proceed from Australia to that summit in Indonesia, where he spent time growing up.
We've had a comprehensive discussion. I very much welcome President Obama to Australia. I think he's already seen that the welcome he's getting from Australians, including Australian schoolchildren, is a very warm one. And I know that that is going to be sustained during tonight's events and the events of tomorrow.
President Obama, over to you.
President Obama. Well, good day, everybody. And thank you, Madam Prime Minister, for your generous welcome, your friendship and your partnership. I am thrilled to be down under.
As you may know, this is not my first visit to Australia. In fact, I first visited Australia as a boy. And I've never forgotten the warmth and kindness that the Australian people extended to me when I was 6 and 8. And I can see that the Australian people have lost none of that warmth.
I very much wanted to take this trip last year, and although events back home prevented me from doing so, I was determined to come for a simple reason: The United States of America has no stronger ally than Australia. We are bound by common values, the rights and the freedoms that we cherish. And for nearly a century, we've stood together in defense of these freedoms. And I'm very happy to be here as we celebrate the 60th anniversary of our alliance and as we work together to strengthen it for the future.
We are two Pacific nations, and with my visit to the region I am making it clear that the United States is stepping up its commitment to the entire Asia-Pacific. In this work, we're deeply grateful for our alliance with Australia and the leadership role that it plays. As it has been for six decades, our alliance is going to be indispensable to our shared future, the security we need and the prosperity that we seek not only in this region, but around the world.
I'm also very grateful for my partnership with Prime Minister Gillard. We've worked quite a bit together lately--
Prime Minister Gillard. You bet.
President Obama. --spanning time zones: the G-20 in Cannes, APEC and TPP in Hawaii; now here in Australia; and next onto Bali for the East Asia Summit. And this speaks to how closely our countries work together on a wide range of issues. And in my friend Julia, I see the quality that we Americans admire most in our Australian friends: somebody who's down to earth, easy to talk to, and who says it like it is, straight up. And that's why we achieved so much today.
We agreed to push ahead with our efforts to create jobs for our people by bringing our economies and those of the region even closer together. Building on our progress at APEC, we're going to keep striving for a seamless regional economy. And as the two largest economies in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Australia and the United States are helping to lead the way to a new model for trade across the region. And along with our G-20 partners, we agreed that we have to stay focused on the growth that creates jobs and that every nation needs to play by the same economic rules of the road.
As two global partners, we discussed the whole range of challenges where we stand shoulder to shoulder, including Afghanistan. Obviously, this has not been an easy mission for either of our countries, and our hearts go out to the families that were affected on October 29. But we both understand what's at stake, what happens when Al Qaida has safe havens. We've seen the awful loss of life, from 9/11 to Bali.
So I thanked the Prime Minister for Australia's strong commitment to this mission. I salute the extraordinary sacrifices of our forces who serve together, including your Australian troops who've shown that no job is too tough for your Diggers. Today the Prime Minister and I reaffirmed the way forward. The transition has begun. Afghans are stepping into the lead. As they do, our troops, American and Australian, will draw down responsibly together so that we preserve the progress that we've made, and by 2014, Afghans will take full responsibility for security in their country.
But our focus today, as the Prime Minister said, was on preparing our alliance for the future. And so I am very pleased that we are able to make these announcements here together on Australian soil. Because of these initiatives that are the result of our countries working very closely together as partners, we're going to be in a position to more effectively strengthen the security of both of our nations and this region.
As Julia described, we are increasing our cooperation, and I'd add, America's commitment to this region. Our U.S. Marines will begin rotating through Darwin for joint training and exercises. Our Air Force will rotate additional aircraft through more airfields in northern Australia. And these rotations, which are going to be taking place on Australian bases, will bring our militaries even closer and make them even more effective. We'll enhance our ability to train, exercise, and operate with allies and partners across the region, and that in turn will allow us to work with these nations to respond even faster to a wide range of challenges, including humanitarian crises and disaster relief, as well as promoting security cooperation across the region.
And this commitment builds upon the best traditions of our alliance. For decades, Australians have welcomed our servicemembers as they've come here to work, train, and exercise together. And I'm looking forward to joining the Prime Minister in Darwin tomorrow to thank our troops, Australians and Americans, for the incredible work that they are doing.
Finally, as I'll discuss more in my speech to Parliament tomorrow, this deepening of our alliance sends a clear message of our commitment to this region, a commitment that is enduring and unwavering. It's a commitment that I'll reaffirm in Bali as the United States joins the East Asia Summit. And I want to thank our Australian friends who supported our membership so strongly and have worked to make sure that the EAS addresses regional challenges that affect all of us like proliferation and maritime security.
So again, I'm very pleased that we're able to make these important announcements during my visit. Madam Prime Minister, I thank you for being such a strong partner and a champion of our alliance.
And once again, I want to thank the Australian people for the kindness they showed me about 40 years ago and the kindness that they're showing me during my visit today. It's that friendship and that solidarity that makes and keeps our alliance one of the strongest in the world.
Prime Minister Gillard. Thank you.
We'll turn to taking some questions. I think we'll probably take one from the Australian media first. It's Phil Hudson.
U.S. Troop Deployment in Australia/China/U.S. Military Operations in Afghanistan
Q. Phillip Hudson from the Melbourne Herald Sun. Mr. President, welcome back to Australia.
President Obama. Thank you very much.
Q. You and Prime Minister Gillard have outlined what is for us a significant new U.S. troop buildup. How much of this is because you're worried about the rise of China? And as of today's deal, U.S. Marines will be for the first time conducting exercises by themselves on Australian soil. Why is that, and what will they be doing?
And, Mr. President, you also mentioned in your remarks that Afghanistan is not an easy mission. In the past few months, there have been three cases for Australia where our troops have been shot at by the Afghan soldiers who have been training, and sadly, four of our soldiers have died, and many others have been injured. Australian public opinion is strongly against our involvement continuing. You outlined the--just then, the drawdown. What can you say to the Australian people who don't want to wait, who want to leave immediately?
President Obama. Well, first, with respect to these new initiatives, this rotational deployment is significant because what it allows us to do is to not only build capacity and cooperation between our two countries, but it also allows us to meet the demands of a lot of partners in the region that want to feel that they're getting the training, they're getting the exercises, and that we have the presence that's necessary to maintain the security architecture in the region.
And so, as Julia mentioned, this is a region that's becoming increasingly important. The economy in this area is going to be the engine for world economic growth for some time to come. The lines of commerce and trade are constantly expanding. And it's appropriate then for us to make sure that not only our alliance, but the security architecture of the region is updated for the 21st century, and this initiative is going to allow us to do that.
It also allows us to respond to a whole host of challenges, like humanitarian or disaster relief, that frankly, given how large the Asia-Pacific region is, it can sometimes be difficult to do, and this will allow us to be able to respond in a more timely fashion and also equip a lot of countries, smaller countries who may not have the same capacity, it allows us to equip them so that they can respond more quickly as well.
And I guess the last part of your question, with respect to China, I've said repeatedly and I will say again today that we welcome a rising, peaceful China. What they've been able to achieve in terms of lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty over the last two decades has been nothing short of remarkable. And that is good not just for China, but it's potentially good for the region. And I know Australia's economy obviously has benefited by the increased demand that you're seeing in China.
The main message that I've said not only publicly, but also privately to the Chinese is that with their rise comes increased responsibilities. It's important for them to play by the rules of the road and in fact help underwrite the rules that have allowed so much remarkable economic progress to be made over the last several decades. And that's going to be true on a whole host of issues.
So where China is playing by those rules, recognizing its new role, I think this is a win-win situation. There are going to be times where they're not, and we will send a clear message to them that we think that they need to be on track in terms of accepting the rules and responsibilities that come with being a world power.
With respect to Afghanistan, the impact of any loss of life among our troops is heartbreaking. And obviously, as President of the United States, there's no greater responsibility and nothing more difficult than putting our troops in harm's way. I think Prime Minister Gillard feels the same way that I do, which is we would not be sending our young men and women into harm's way unless we thought it was absolutely necessary for the security of our country.
What we have established is a transition process that allows Afghans to build up their capacity and take on a greater security role over the next 2 years. But it's important that we do it right. As some of you are aware, I just announced that all remaining troops in Iraq will be removed. It would have been tempting, given that I have been opposed to the Iraq war from the start, when I came into office, to say, we're going to get you all out right away. But what I recognized was that if we weren't thoughtful about how we proceed, then the enormous sacrifices that had been made by our men and women in the previous years might be for naught.
And what I'd say to the Australian people at this point is, given the enormous investment that's been made and the signs that we can, in fact, leave behind a country that's not perfect, but one that is more stable, more secure, and does not provide safe haven for terrorists, it's appropriate for us to finish the job and do it right.
Prime Minister Gillard. If I could just add to that and say, every time I have met President Obama and we've talked about our alliance, we've talked about our work in Afghanistan, and in our meetings, both formal and informal, the President has shown the greatest possible concern for our troops in the field. Now, the meetings we've had over the last few weeks at various international events have coincided with some of the most bitter and difficult news that we've had from Afghanistan, and every step of the way the President has gone out of his way to convey to me his condolences for the Australian people and particularly for the families that have suffered such a grievous loss.

Global Economic Stabilization Efforts/U.S. Economy
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Chancellor Merkel said this week that Europe is in its toughest hour since World War II. Markets are now showing some anxiety about the possibility of instability spreading to France as well. Are you worried that the steps European leaders are taking are too incremental so far? Do you think something bolder or a more difficult set of decisions need to be taken to fully ring-fence that crisis?
I have a question for Prime Minister Gillard as well. Are you concerned that the fiscal pressures the United States is under at the moment may compromise its ability to sustain its plans for the region, including the initiatives announced today? Do you have to take those with something of a grain of salt until the supercommittee process is concluded?
President Obama. With respect to Europe, I'm deeply concerned, have been deeply concerned, I suspect we'll be deeply concerned tomorrow and next week and the week after that. Until we put in place a concrete plan and structure that sends a clear signal to the markets that Europe is standing behind the euro and will do what it takes, we're going to continue to see the kinds of turmoil that we saw in the markets today--or was it yesterday? I'm trying to figure out what--[laughter]--what time zone I'm in here.
Prime Minister Gillard. It's all of the time.
President Obama. All of the--right. [Laughter] We have consulted very closely with our European friends. I think that there is a genuine desire on the part of leaders like President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel to solve this crisis. But they've got a complicated political structure.
The problem right now is a problem of political will; it's not a technical problem. We saw some progress with Italy and Greece both putting forward essentially unity governments that can implement some significant reforms that need to take place in those countries. But at this point, the larger European community has to stand behind the European project. And for those American readers or listeners, and those Australian readers or listeners, I think we all understand at this point, we've got an integrated world economy and what happens in Europe will have an impact on us.
So we are going to continue to advise European leaders on what options we think would meet the threshold where markets would settle down. It is going to require some tough decisions on their part. They have made some progress on some fronts, like their efforts to recapitalize the banks. But ultimately, what they're going to need is a firewall that sends a clear signal: ""We stand behind the European project, and we stand behind the euro."" And those members of the euro zone, they are going to have the liquidity they need to service their debt. So there's more work to do on that front.
And just--I don't want to steal your question, but I do want to just say, with respect to our budget, there's a reason why I'm spending this time out here in Asia and out here in the Pacific region. First and foremost, because this is the fastest growing economic region in the world, and I want to create jobs in the United States, which means we've got to sell products here and invest here and have a robust trading relationship here, and Australia happens to be one of our strongest trading partners.
But the second message I'm trying to send is that we are here to stay. This is a region of huge strategic importance to us. And I've been--I've made very clear, and I'll amplify in my speech to Parliament tomorrow, that even as we make a whole host of important fiscal decisions back home, this is right up there at the top of my priority list. And we're going to make sure that we are able to fulfill our leadership role in the Asia-Pacific region.
Prime Minister Gillard. And I was just going to make what I think is the commonsense point. I'm not going to issue words of advice about the fiscal position in the United States, but the commonsense point from the point of view of the leader is, ultimately, budgets are about choices and there are hard choices about the things you value. And I think, by President Obama being here, he is saying he values the role of the United States in this region and our alliance, and that's what the announcement we've made today is all about.
We've got a question from Mark Riley from the Australian media.
India/Australia-India Relations/Environment
Q. Thanks, Ma'am. This is Mark Riley from 7News, Australia. Mr. President, I wanted to ask you about the other rising giant of our region, India. And the Prime Minister might like to add some comments. How significant is it for the U.S. that Australia is now considering selling uranium to India? And could you clear up for us what influence or encouragement your administration gave Australia as it made that decision?
And also, the decision is so India can produce clean energy. In that regard, you're aware that our Parliament has passed a new bill pricing carbon, a carbon tax, if you like. But we're intrigued about where America is going on this issue. And countries like Australia don't see a carbon trading system in the world working unless America is a big part of it. Can you tell us, is it your wish that American will have an emissions trading scheme across the Nation within the next 5 years or so? How heavily do you want to see America involved in an emissions trading scheme globally? Or has this become too politically hard for you?
President Obama. Good. Well, first of all, with respect to India, we have not had any influence, I suspect, on Australia's decision to explore what its relationship in terms of the peaceful use of nuclear energy in India might be. I suspect that you've got some pretty smart Government officials here who figured out that India is a big player and that the Australia-India relationship is one that should be cultivated. So they--I don't think Julia or anybody else needs my advice in figuring that out. This is part of your neighborhood, and you are going to make bilateral decisions about how to move forward.
I think, without wading into the details, the discussions that are currently taking place here in Australia around that relationship and the nuclear issue with India are ones that are compatible with international law, compatible with decisions that were made in the NPT. And I will watch with interest what's determined. But this is not something between the United States and Australia, this is something between India and Australia.
With respect to carbon emissions, I think I share the view of your Prime Minister and most scientists in the world that climate change is a real problem and that human activity is contributing to it and that we all have a responsibility to find ways to reduce our carbon emissions.
Each country is trying to figure out how to do that most effectively. Here in Australia, under the leadership of the Prime Minister, you've moved forward with a bold strategy. In the United States, although we haven't passed a what we call a cap-and-trade system, an exchange, what we have done is, for example, taken steps to double fuel efficiency standard on cars, which will have an enormous impact on removing carbon from the atmosphere.
We've invested heavily in clean energy research. We believe very strongly that with improved efficiencies and a whole step--a whole range of steps that we can meet and the commitments that we made in Copenhagen and Cancun. And as we move forward over the next several years, my hope is, is that the United States, as one of several countries with a big carbon footprint, can find further ways to reduce our carbon emissions. I think that's good for the world. I actually think, over the long term, it's good for our economies as well, because it's my strong belief that industries, utilities, individual consumers, we're all going to have to adapt how we use energy and how we think about carbon.
Now, another belief that I think the Prime Minister and I share is that the advanced economies can't do this alone. So part of our insistence when we are in multilateral fora--and I will continue to insist on this when we go to Durban--is that if we are taking a series of steps, then it's important that emerging economies like China and India are also part of the bargain. It doesn't mean that they have to do exactly what we do. We understand that in terms of per capita carbon emissions, they've got a long way to go before they catch up to us. But it does mean that they've got to take seriously their responsibilities as well.
And so ultimately, what we want is a mechanism whereby all countries are making an effort. And it's going to be a tough slog, particularly at a time when the economies are--a lot of economies are still struggling. But I think it's actually one that over the long term can be beneficial.

China/Trade
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Prime Minister Gillard. I wanted to double back to the topic of China. It seems there's a bit of a schizophrenic aspect to this week of summitry in the Asian-Pacific, where China is participating from Hawaii to Indonesia, but then you have all the rest of you who are talking about, on the one hand, a trade bloc that excludes China, and now this--and an increased military presence for the United States, which is symbolized most by this agreement the two of you have made for a permanent U.S. presence in Australia.
What is it everyone fears so much from China? And isn't there some risk that you would increase tensions in a way that would take some of the--China might take some of the very actions you fear?
Prime Minister Gillard. I'm happy to start with that and then go to the President. I don't--I think there's actually a theme throughout the work we've been involved with at APEC, some of the discussion here and what we will take to the East Asia Summit. We may be on a journey from saying ""aloha"" to ""good day"" to ""bali hai"" or something like that. But I actually think in terms of strategic outlook, it remains the same, which is both of our nations are deeply engaged with China as it rises and we want to see China rise into the global rules-based order.
That's our aspiration. I understand it to be the aspiration of the United States. It's something that we pursue bilaterally with China. It's something that we pursue multilaterally in the various forums that we work in.
This East Asia Summit will have a particular significance, coming for the first time with the President of the United States there and of course Russia represented around the table, so all of the players with the right mandate to discuss strategic, political, and economic questions for our region.
So I actually believe there's a continuity here: APEC fundamentally focused on trade and economic liberalization; here in Australia, longtime allies, talking about the future of their alliance and building for that future, as you would expect, but also preparing for a set of discussions in Bali, which will bring us together again with our friends across the region.
President Obama. Just to pick up on this theme, Jackie, I think the notion that we fear China is mistaken. The notion that we are looking to exclude China is mistaken. And I'll take TPP as a perfect example of this. We haven't excluded China from the TPP. What we have said is, the future of this region depends on robust trade and commerce and the only way we're going to grow that trade is if we have a high-standards trade agreement where everybody is playing by the same rules, where if one set of markets is open then there's reciprocity among the other trading partners, where there are certain rules that we abide by in terms of intellectual property rights protection or how we deal with government procurement, in addition to the traditional areas like tariffs.
And what we saw in Honolulu, in APEC, was that a number of countries that weren't part of the initial discussions--like Japan, Canada, Mexico--all expressed an interest in beginning the consultations to be part of this high-standard trade agreement that could potentially be a model for the entire region.
Now, if China says, we want to consult with you about being part of this as well, we welcome that. It will require China to rethink some of its approaches to trade, just as every other country that's been involved in the consultations for the TPP have had to think through, all right, what kinds of adjustments are we willing to make?
And so that's the consistent theme here. This is a growing region. It is a vital region. The United States is going to be a huge participant in both economic and security issues in the Asia-Pacific region, and our overriding desire is that we have a clear set of principles that all of us can abide by so that all of us can succeed. And I think it's going to be important for China to be a part of that. I think that's good for us.
But it's going to require China, just like all the rest of us, to align our existing policies and what we've done in the past with what's needed for a brighter future. All right?
Prime Minister Gillard. Thank you very much.
President Obama. Thank you very much, everybody.
Prime Minister Gillard. Thank you."

Please have a seat. Good afternoon, everybody. It is my pleasure to welcome two great friends and partners, President Calderon of Mexico and Prime Minister Harper of Canada.
Now, I've worked with Stephen and Felipe on many occasions. We've joined our international partners from APEC to the G-20. From our last summit in Guadalajara, we remember Felipe's hospitality and that of the Mexican people, including some very good mariachi and----
President Calderon. Mexican food.
President Obama. ----some tequila, if I'm not mistaken. [Laughter] I can't reciprocate the music, but Felipe, Stephen and I are proud to welcome you here today.
President Calderon. Thank you.
President Obama. Between us, we represent nearly half a billion citizens, from Nunavut in the Canadian north to Chiapas in southern Mexico. In between, the diversity of our peoples and cultures is extraordinary. But wherever they live, they wake up every day with similar hopes: to provide for their families, to be safe in their communities, to give their children a better life. And in each of our countries, the daily lives of our citizens are shaped profoundly by what happens in the other two. And that's why we're here.
Today we focused on our highest priority: creating jobs and opportunity for our people. In the United States, our businesses have created nearly 4 million new jobs, confidence is up, and the economy is getting stronger. But with lots of folks still struggling to find work and pay the bills, we are doing everything we can to speed up the recovery. And that includes boosting trade with our two largest economic partners.
As President, I've made it a priority to increase our exports, and I'm pleased that our exports to Canada and Mexico are growing faster than our exports to the rest of the world. In fact, last year trade in goods with our two neighbors surpassed $1 trillion for the first time ever. This trade supports some 2.5 million American jobs, and I want more trade supporting even more jobs in the future.
So today Prime Minister Harper led us in a very good discussion about how our three countries can improve our competitiveness. We agreed to continue making our borders more efficient and more secure so it's faster and cheaper to travel and trade. We're expanding cooperation to create clean energy jobs and combat climate change, an area in which President Calderon and Mexico have been a real leader.
I'm pleased to announce that our three nations are launching a new effort to get rid of outdated regulations that stifle job creation. Here in the United States, our efforts to cut redtape and ensure smart regulations will help achieve savings and benefits to businesses, consumers, and our country of more than $100 billion. And we're already working to streamline and coordinate regulations with Canada and Mexico on a bilateral basis. So now our three nations are going to sit down together, go through the books, and simplify and eliminate more regulations that will make our joint economies stronger.
This is especially important, by the way, for our small and medium-sized businesses, which, when they start exporting, often start with Mexico and Canada. So this is going to help create jobs, and it's going to keep us on track to meet my goal of doubling U.S. exports.
More broadly, I reiterated my commitment to comprehensive immigration reform, which would be good for workers and good for business. I'm pleased that Canada and Mexico have also expressed an interest in joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Consultations with our TPP partners are now underway on how new members can meet the high standards of this trade agreement, which could be a real model for the world. And I very much appreciated President Calderon updating us on preparations for the next G-20 summit, which he will be hosting in June.
Our other major focus today was the security that our citizens deserve. Criminal gangs and narcotraffickers pose a threat to each of our nations, and each of our nations has a responsibility to meet that threat. In Mexico, President Calderon has shown great courage in standing up to the traffickers and cartels, and we've sped up the delivery of equipment and assistance to support those efforts.
Here in the United States, we've increased cooperation on our southern border and dedicated new resources to reducing the southbound flow of money and guns and to reduce the demand for drugs in the United States, which helps fuel--helped to fuel this crisis. And today each of us reaffirmed our commitment to meeting this challenge together, because that's the only way that we're going to succeed.
Beyond our borders, these cartels and traffickers pose an extraordinary threat to our Central American neighbors. So we're teaming up. Defense ministers from our three countries met last week as a group for the first time ever. And we're going to be coordinating our efforts more closely than ever, especially when it comes to supporting Central America's new strategy on citizen security, which will be discussed at the Summit of the Americas in Colombia next week.
So again, I want to thank Stephen and Felipe for being here. When I came to office, I pledged to seek new partnerships with our friends in the Americas, a relationship of equality and shared responsibility built on mutual interest and mutual respect. That's what we've done. And it wouldn't have been possible without the leadership and sense of purpose that these two outstanding leaders have brought to all our efforts, including our efforts today. As a result, I believe our nations and our citizens will be more secure, more prosperous, and in a better position to give their children the lives that they deserve.
So with that, let me turn it over to President Calderon.
President Calderon. Thank you, President Obama. Your Excellency, Mr. Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, Right Honorable Stephen Harper, Prime Minister of Canada, ladies and gentlemen of the press, Mr. Ambassadors, legislators, friends: First of all, I would like to thank President Barack Obama for his extraordinary hospitality and that of his Government in hosting this summit of the leaders of North America.
And briefly, I would also like to express on behalf of the Government of Mexico, the people of Mexico, my family, and my own behalf, my most sincere sympathies to the family and relatives of former President Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado for his lamentable death yesterday. Tomorrow we will be rendering homage to him in Mexico.
The reasons that--for which we are here today at this summit of the North American leaders with President Barack Obama and the Prime Minister of Canada, we've come through a work day that has been very fruitful and fluid with an exchange of opinions and progress to the benefit of our respective citizens.
I'm also very thankful to my two colleagues for the openness with which we have broached some very complex items on our working agenda. I recognize and value their enormous commitment to our common region.
The leaders of North America share a vision of a strong, solidary, safe, competitive region that is able to successfully face head on the challenges of today. We agree that our common challenges can only be faced together. And therein lays the importance of having dialogue, strong dialogue, amongst our three countries.
The data that President Obama has just given us is very important, that our trade has exceeded $1 trillion for the first time. And I think that that is not separate from a reality that has to be underscored. In this very complex world full of economic problems and severe crises, Canada, the United States, and Mexico are three countries that are growing right now and generating jobs today.
And that growth and those millions of jobs, many of them have to do precisely with the greatest trade exchanges that we have ever seen amongst these great nations. I would say that the potential of North America tied to these three countries is such that within our own nations we have a great deal to do to make the most of these opportunities for greater exchanges amongst our peoples.
As we've mentioned today, we have progressed on various fronts. For instance, we've advanced on the deregulation in our countries--in our own countries, as well as amongst our countries. We have progressed as well in harmonization of certain standards that facilitate trade. We've also progressed, in our case, on the bilateral relationship in border infrastructure. And all of this has led, of course, to the benefit of Canadian, Mexican, and American families.
In another line of ideas, I would also say that the three nations have renewed their decision to strengthen cooperation at the international level, particularly in issues as sensitive as the security of our citizens. We have reiterated the values upon which our societies were founded: democracy, liberty, justice, the respect for human rights. And today the political dialogue amongst us is perhaps stronger than ever.
We have renewed certain principles of our existence and of our challenges: the principle of shared responsibility, the exchange of information, and especially the strengthening of our institutions that has to be the guide of our cooperation.
Clearly, I expressed to President Obama and to Prime Minister Harper that the fight that Mexico is experiencing for a safer North America also requires a strengthening of national actions, amongst other things, to stop the traffic of weapons, to combat with greater strength money laundering, and of course, to reduce the demand for drugs that strengthens criminal organizations. I also expressed to President Obama and to Prime Minister Harper that Mexico recognizes that the commitment that they have undertaken to progress along those lines, it's also necessary to strengthen the regional security focus, and in order to do this, we need to include our neighbors and Central American partners, who are also facing serious problems and who need our solidarity. The three countries have agreed to establish a joint dialogue mechanism with the Central American Integration System, SICA, in support of the efforts undertaken by Central American nations to fight organized crime and in favor of regional security that benefits us all.
Of course, in this meeting, we have broached the topic of the regional economy. The leaders of North America agree that the United States, Canada, and Mexico must continue to delve deeper into our successful economic relationship so as to generate more jobs and greater well-being in all three countries.
Our governments recognize that it is absolutely necessary to continue to fully comply with the NAFTA, as well as to explore new means of strengthening regional competitiveness. And I am convinced that if we work together, we will become much more competitive than many areas of the world that we are competing with today.
Mexico's position is that the solution to the complex economic situation experienced by the world today is not a return to protectionist practices that only isolate countries, reduce competitiveness of economies, and send investment scurrying, but that part of the problem and the part of the investment that we need to see in the world economy is to see a delving deeper into our economies and making the most of our advantages that show our economic complementarity in terms of investment, labor, technologies, natural resources. And only then will we be able to have success in a world that competes ferociously by regions.
The three countries have renewed our commitment to broaden the productive--the supply chains of the region that will be even more interconnected, supporting especially the small and medium-scale companies.
Mexican exports to the world represent 37 percent of--or have, rather, 37 percent of American content. In other words, so American exports are American exports, and they generate millions of jobs for the region. And in that lays the need to work even more in this region on a clear trilateral deregulation, for instance, in nanomaterials and emissions standards for some vehicles.
Today we also agreed to work in a coordinated fashion on actions that we will be adopting to modernize infrastructure and for border management. After 10 years--the last 2 years, we've seen three new border crossing areas between Mexico and the United States, after 10 years of not having seen one new route. And we continue to work in a coordinated fashion to make our border more dynamic so that it's a border of opportunities for progress on both sides of that border.
Tomorrow, here in Washington, our ministers of economy and of trade will be meeting within the framework of the Free Trade Commission of the NAFTA so as to continue to work towards achieving these objectives.
Today, we've seen that prosperity in the region depends on greater integration with full respect of our sovereignties in all fields. And in this context, I'd like to reiterate the interest of my country to join forces as soon as possible to the TPP, or the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and its negotiations. Because we know that Mexicans can contribute to a quick and successful conclusion of this project. If we join forces in this region where we see the greatest growth in the world, we will be generating benefits for our families, our workers, and also substantially improving the competitiveness of the three countries in this context.
We are convinced that the experience and participation of Mexico will enrich this free trade project of the latest generation that encompasses countries in Asia, Oceania, and America. Our country has a clear commitment to economic freedom. We even have the support of the private sector so as to enter into the TPP. We are a nation that believes in free trade as a true tool to foster growth and development, and we have acted as a result of this.
I would also like to thank the United States and Canada for renewing their support to Mexico and its presidency of G-20. As you know, in June of this year, Mexico will host the summit of the leaders of the G-20 in Los Cabos. We are convinced, over and above the topics that we will be dealing with there, that the complex international environment needs to be an opportunity so that the world can redefine its development models with a firm commitment to the well-being of peoples and the care for the environment.
Ladies and gentlemen, in this summit, the representatives of the United States, Canada, and Mexico have undertaken an open, constructive dialogue, just as corresponds to countries that share values. We've talked about the enormous challenges facing us so as to work together in a globalized world. And as a result, we will be working on building a new era that consolidates the right conditions for development in North America on the basis of a successful partnership, as we have seen so far today.
My dear President Obama, thank you for your hospitality.
President Obama. Prime Minister Harper.
Prime Minister Harper. Well, first of all, I'd like to begin by thanking you, Barack, for so graciously and so warmly--literally--hosting us here today. And I'd also like to begin by offering my sincere condolences to you, Felipe, and through you, to the people of Mexico on the passing of former President Miguel de la Madrid, who I gather had much to do with the NAFTA partnership that we enjoy today.
Canada places the highest value on the friendship and partnership among our three countries. We form one of the world's largest free trade zones, which has been of great benefit to all of our nations. We're also effective collaborators in the G-20 in responding to the challenges of the global recession and instability of these past few years.
As affirmed in our budget last week, our Government is focused on creating jobs, growth, and long-term prosperity for all Canadians.
I'm especially pleased that the United States has welcomed Canada's and Mexico's interest in joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We also had useful discussions on continued cooperation in managing our borders, streamlining regulation, securing global supply chains, and advancing clean energy.
In addition, we've announced a broadened plan for North American pandemic preparedness and a new North America-Central America dialogue on security to fight transnational organized crime.
Finally, we discussed the agenda for the upcoming Summit of the Americas in Colombia. Canada looks forward to continue to working with the United States and Mexico to promote democratic principles, regional stability, and market-based economic growth with our partners in the Western Hemisphere.
And once again, Barack and Felipe, I look forward to continuing our useful discussions in Cartagena.
President Obama. Outstanding.
All right, I think that we're going to take a question from each press delegation. So I'll start with Julianna [Julianna Goldman, Bloomberg News].
U.S. Influence Abroad/Health Care Reform
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. After last week's arguments at the Supreme Court, many experts believe that there could be a majority, a five-member majority, to strike down the individual mandate. And if that were to happen, if it were to be ruled unconstitutional, how would you still guarantee health care to the uninsured and those Americans who've become insured as a result of the law?
And then a question for President Calderon and Prime Minister Harper: Over the weekend, Governor Mitt Romney said that the U.S. used to promote free enterprise around the world, and he said, ""Our President doesn't have the same feelings about American exceptionalism that we do, and I think over the last 3 or 4 years, some people around the world have begun to question that."" So my question to the both of you is whether you think that American influence has declined over the last 3 to 4 years.
And, President Obama, if you'd like to respond to that too.
President Obama. Well, on the second part of your question, it's still primary season for the Republican Party. They're going to make a decision about who their candidate will be.
It's worth noting that I first arrived on the national stage with a speech at the Democratic Convention that was entirely about American exceptionalism and that my entire career has been a testimony to American exceptionalism. But I will cut folks some slack for now because they're still trying to get their nomination.
With respect to health care, I'm actually--continue to be confident that the Supreme Court will uphold the law. And the reason is because, in accordance with precedent out there, it's constitutional. That's not just my opinion, by the way; that's the opinion of legal experts across the ideological spectrum, including two very conservative appellate court justices that said this wasn't even a close case.
I think it's important--because I watched some of the commentary last week--to remind people that this is not an abstract argument. People's lives are affected by the lack of availability of health care, the inaffordability of health care, their inability to get health care because of preexisting conditions.
The law that's already in place has already given 2.5 million young people health care that wouldn't otherwise have it. There are tens of thousands of adults with preexisting conditions who have health care right now because of this law. Parents don't have to worry about their children not being able to get health care because they can't be prevented from getting health care as a consequence of a preexisting condition. That's part of this law.
Millions of seniors are paying less for prescription drugs because of this law. Americans all across the country have greater rights and protections with respect to their insurance companies and are getting preventive care because of this law.
So that's just the part that's already been implemented. That doesn't even speak to the 30 million people who stand to gain coverage once it's fully implemented in 2014.
And I think it's important, and I think the American people understand, and the--I think the Justices should understand that in the absence of an individual mandate, you cannot have a mechanism to ensure that people with preexisting conditions can actually get health care. So there's not only a economic element to this and a legal element to this, but there's a human element to this. And I hope that's not forgotten in this political debate.
Ultimately, I'm confident that the Supreme Court will not take what would be an unprecedented, extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress. And I'd just remind conservative commentators that for years what we've heard is, the biggest problem on the bench was judicial activism or a lack of judicial restraint, that an unelected group of people would somehow overturn a duly constituted and passed law. Well, this is a good example. And I'm pretty confident that this Court will recognize that and not take that step.
Q. You say it's not an abstract conversation. Do you have contingency plans?
President Obama. I'm sorry. As I said, we are confident that this will be over--that this will be upheld. I'm confident that this will be upheld because it should be upheld. And again, that's not just my opinion, that's the opinion of a whole lot of constitutional law professors and academics and judges and lawyers who have examined this law, even if they're not particularly sympathetic to this particular piece of legislation or my Presidency.
President Calderon. Your question was a little local for me, and so I'm glad that the President of the United States answered it. But I would take advantage of this moment to say that after increasing the budget line for the folk insurance six-fold and after having built more than 1,000 new clinics in the country, we're getting close to reaching universal coverage of health care: full, free health care coverage for all people up to 18 years of age, including cancer coverage. Of the 120--112 million Mexicans, 106 million will have efficient, effective universal health care coverage.
So I would say that I would hope that one of the greatest economies in the world, such as the United States, could follow our example in achieving this, because it was a great thing.
Prime Minister Harper. Well, I don't think you really expect me to intervene in the U.S. Presidential election. Let me just say this. For Canada--and this is something that I think transcends governments in Canada or administrations here in the United States--for Canada, the United States is and always will be our closest neighbor, our greatest ally, and our best friend. And I believe that American leadership is at all times great and indispensable for the world.
And I think over the past few years we've done great things together in terms of the response both through the G-20 and bilaterally on the recession and the recovery. We had, under your leadership, Barack, that successful intervention in Libya. Our trade relationship is the biggest in the world and growing. And so I think it's been a tremendous partnership.
President Obama. Somebody from the Mexican press corps.
Gun Trafficking/Mexico's Presidential Election/Canada's Visa Program
Q. Good afternoon. For President Calderon, you were saying--you were referring to weapons. We'd like to know what President Obama said in terms of what's going to be done to stop the traffic of weapons.
And, President Obama, I'd like to know what plans your Government has in the Presidential election process in Mexico. What was discussed in terms of the interviews with the candidates in Mexico City? And I'd also like to know, for the Government of the United States, there's a threat for the country in this sense on weapons, Mr. President. Weapons have come into the country. Are there military leaks of letting the arms come through? What's going to be done?
And for Prime Minister Harper, are--is the visa requirement going to be removed for Mexicans? Thank you.
President Obama. That's a lot of questions. [Laughter] Go ahead, go first.
President Calderon. My position on this subject is very clear, and I would repeat it here. Let me broach it from another angle. It's been shown that when there is an excessive, quick availability of weapons in any given society, there is an increase in violence and the murders that goes on many years afterwards.
This phenomenon took place in many places of Africa after their civil wars. We've seen it in El Salvador, Guatemala, in Eastern Europe, in Kosovo, in Bosnia. It's happened--it's taken place in many different areas of the world. And we sustain that the expiry of the assault weapons ban in the year 2004 coincided almost exactly with the beginning of the harshest period of violence we've ever seen.
During my Government, we have seized over 140,000 weapons in 4 years. And I think that the vast majority have been assault weapons: AK-57s, et cetera. And many, the vast majority of these weapons were sold in gun shops in the United States. Along the border of the U.S. and Mexico, there are approximately 8,000 weapons shops. If we do our accounts, that means that there are approximately nine weapons stores for each Walmart that exists in the United States and Mexico.
So a good deal of our discussion did touch upon this. But I recognize, at the same time, the administrative effort that's been undertaken, particularly by President Obama and his administration, so that the agencies for control of illegal actions curb this export of guns and weapons to Mexico. We've seen a much more active effort in this sense than in any other time in the past.
I have a great deal of respect for the U.S. legislation, especially the Second Amendment. But I know that if we don't stop the traffic of weapons into Mexico, also if we don't have mechanisms to forbid the sale of weapons, such as we had in the nineties, or for registry of guns, at least for assault weapons, then we are never going to be able to stop the violence in Mexico or stop a future turning of those guns upon the U.S.
So, if I am against the traffic of weapons in Mexico, I'm against the traffic of weapons anywhere, be that within any circumstance. The Government of Mexico will never be able to accept anything that has to do with opening this.
President Obama has been very clear on the position of his Government. We understand the work being done by the agencies to stop the criminals. But this cannot be an obstacle to the cooperation that we have to have amongst Mexico and the United States to stop these criminal activities that underlie this issue, which is one of the greatest obstacles and problems for Mexico.
I understand the internal problems from a political point of view in the United States, and I mentioned this publicly in Congress in the United States, and I said things exactly the way I believe them. I said them outright. There's a great deal of discrepancy between points of view. It's a very complex political issue. But it is very important to underscore it.
And I believe that's the only part of the question that I can answer, and I would say that what President Obama has already answered was very well done.
President Obama. Just very briefly, with respect to the Presidential elections in Mexico, Vice President Biden met with the candidates to express sentiments that are similar to the ones that Stephen just expressed here with respect to U.S. elections. And that is that the friendship between our three countries, the partnership between our three countries, extends beyond and is more fundamental than any particular party or any particular election. And that's the message we have to send with respect to Mexico.
I've had a excellent working relationship with Felipe. I expect to have an excellent working relationship with the next Mexican President, whoever that candidate may be, because the underlying common interests that we have economically, socially, culturally, the people-to-people relationship that we have is so important that it transcends partisan politics.
And with respect to the issue of guns, I've made very clear in every meeting that I've had with Felipe--and we've actually put into practice efforts to stop illegal gun trafficking north to south. It is a difficult task, but it's one that we have taken very seriously and taken some unprecedented steps. We will continue to coordinate closely with the Mexican Government because we recognize the toll that it's taken with respect to families and innocent individuals inside of Mexico.
And this is part of our broader comprehensive cooperation in weakening the grip of narcotrafficking within Mexico. And we recognize that we have a responsibility to reduce demand for drugs, that we have a responsibility to make sure that not only guns, but also bulk cash isn't flowing into Mexico. And I--obviously President Calderon takes very seriously his responsibilities to apply effective law enforcement within Mexico. And I think he's taken courageous steps to do that.
So we're going to keep on partnering together in order to continue to make progress on this very important issue.
Prime Minister Harper. You asked me about the visa requirement. The visa requirement is the really only effective means we have in Canada today to deal with large-scale bogus refugee claims under our refugee determination system.
Legislation that is being implemented--and in fact, there's legislation before Parliament to enhance those changes--that legislation will in the future, in years to come, will give us tools other than visa requirement to deal with that particular problem. But as of today that remains the only tool at our disposal.
President Obama. Okay. And finally from----
Prime Minister Harper. Yes. Mark Kennedy, Postmedia News.
Trans-Pacific Partnership/Narcotrafficking/Security Issues
Q. Hello, gentlemen. I have a couple of qu","estions on two critical issues that you were discussing today, one on trade and one on crime. On trade, Prime Minister Harper, why is Canada's position at the negotiating table on the Trans-Pacific Partnership so important to Canada? And secondly, to get us there, to be a player, are you willing to give up as a precondition our supply management system?
And, President Obama, you said earlier that there needs to be high standards for a country to be there. I'm wondering whether you think, yet, Canada has met those high standards--whether you want us to drop our traditional supply management system.
And on crime, we in Canada read about the challenges that Mexico has on the drug cartels and the horrible violence that occurs down there. But perhaps it's possible that many Canadians, and perhaps even Americans, don't see it as affecting their lives, perhaps it doesn't affect their communities. So, on that issue, why do you three gentlemen think that a three-country coordinated approach is necessary to protect our citizens?
And, Prime Minister, I think you being the only person that can speak both English and French, if you can do that, please.
Prime Minister Harper. Sure. First of all, in response to the question on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, this is--our desire to be part of that negotiation is part of Canada's ambitious trade agenda. As you know, we are currently in negotiations with over 50 countries around the world, including the European Union and Japan and India. So this was obviously a logical extension of our desire, the desire of our Government to dramatically broaden our free trade relationships around the world.
Canada's position on Trans-Pacific Partnership is the same as our position in any trade negotiation. We expect to negotiate and debate all manner of issues, and we seek ambitious outcomes to free trade agreements. In those negotiations, of course, Canada will attempt to promote and to defend Canada's interest not just across the economy, but in individual sectors as well.
On the question of security, look, the security problems are--the security challenge, particularly around the drug trade, is a serious regional problem throughout our hemisphere that has real impacts. Not the kind of governance and security impacts we see maybe in Central America and the Caribbean and elsewhere--but has real, serious impacts on the health and safety of communities in our country as well. And as these criminal networks are transnational, it's important that our attempts to fight them be equally transnational. And that's why we work together on these initiatives.
President Obama. Well, with respect to the TPP, as is true of any process of arriving at a trade agreement, every country that's participating is going to have to make some modifications. That's inherent in the process, because each of our countries have their own idiosyncrasies, certain industries that have in the past been protected, certain practices that may be unique to that country, but end up creating disadvantages for businesses from other countries. And so it's a process of everybody making adjustments.
I don't think Canada would be unique in that. Are there areas where we'd like to see some changes in terms of Canadian practices? Of course. I assure you that Canada will have some complaints directed at us, and every member of the Trans-Pacific Partnership eventually would have to make some modifications in order to accommodate the larger interest of growing the overall economy and expanding trade and ultimately jobs. So I don't anticipate that there's something unique about Canada that wouldn't be true for any of the other aspirants to forming this Trans-Pacific Partnership.
With respect to the transnational drug trade, first and foremost, I think we should be concerned about what's happening in Mexico and Central America, because when you have innocent families and women and children who are being gunned down on the streets, that should be everybody's problem, not just our problem, not just their problem.
There's a sense of neighborly regard and concern that has to be part of our calculus and our foreign policy. But more practically, the United States shares a border with Mexico. If you have this kind of violence and the power of the drug trade as a whole expanding in countries that are so closely affiliated with us--in Central American countries--if you start getting a larger and larger space in which they have control over serious chunks of the economy, if they're undermining institutions in these countries, that will impact our capacity to do business in these countries. It could have a spillover effect in terms of our nationals who are living in those countries, tourists that are visiting these countries. It could have a deteriorating effect overall on the nature of our relationship. And that's something that we have to pay attention to.
And as I said, I think the Mexican Government has taken this very seriously at great cost to itself. We have an obligation to take it just as seriously, in part because we are the ultimate destination for a large chunk of this market.
And that--Stephen and I were trading notes--in places like the United States and Canada, this is not just an issue of--that traditionally was very urban. This is disseminated across our communities. And you go into rural communities and you've got methamphetamine sales that are devastating young and old alike, and some of that is originally sourced in Mexico. And so even in the remotest, most isolated parts of Canada or the United States, they're being impacted by this drug trade, and we've got to work cooperatively in order to deal with it.
President Calderon. And I'd like to look at it from another standpoint. The security of North America is absolutely tied to each of its member states. There cannot be full security in this country or in Canada or in Mexico if we do not have a system that actually enables the cooperation mechanisms to act in facing threats that have no borders, that are transnational by their very nature. And these are threats that are not just tied into drug trafficking, which is transnational of course.
And I'll give you two examples of success stories that I was mentioning this morning. One, the attempt to take to Mexico one of the children of Qadhafi--one of Qadhafi's children. This implied an international and very North American operation because it was headed up by a Canadian businesswoman who hired an American company, which hired, in turn, Mexican pilots and counterfeiters. And this multinational operation could have been--would not have been avoided without the international security mechanisms that we didn't have before, but that now we have.
Also, being able to avoid the assassination of the Saudi Ambassador here in Washington would not have been possible without the mechanisms and cooperation that we have today.
So thinking that what happens in Mexico doesn't have anything to do with the security of the citizens of this country or of any other citizen of North America is a mistake. We have to understand that we are all tied to one another.
Now, security, understood in the regional sense--in order to understand that, we have to understand where the greatest threats to security actually lay. The United States has a clear idea of its threat, of its security priorities, its threats of terrorism, of international terrorism, terrible attacks on the U.S. people. Another threat clearly is in the power of transnational organized crime, which I insist is not crime or organizations that are strictly Mexican in nature. They don't have a nationality, and they don't operate in just one country. They're probably operating right here in this city.
In Washington, for instance, the number of homicides per 100,000 inhabitants is higher by 10--more than 10 or 20 than the largest number in any of the big cities in Mexico. These are international organizations that have a growing destructive capacity, that act well beyond borders and threaten anyone, anywhere.
It is true, the efforts that we undertake clearly make it possible to contain that threat and to prevent it from acting in society--not just in the United States or Canada, but even in Mexico. And that explains why, for instance, despite the perception of my country, last year 23 million tourists came to our country by plane, plus another 7 million in cruise ships, plus another 50 million who crossed the border, the land borders.
So that's also why there are 2 million Mexicans living comfortably in Mexico, and many more living also here who came to visit us here and wanted to see us in the White House. And that's also why 1.6 million Canadians come to Mexico every year. So that's 5 percent of the Canadian population that travels to Mexico every year.
And that also explains why, despite the fact that a State such as Texas recommends that none of its young people should travel to anywhere in Mexico, that's why there are hundreds of thousands of young Texans who go to Mexico, enjoy it, and why we haven't seen one single incident with U.S. spring-breakers in Mexico this past spring, for instance.
Great concern, because these are multinational criminal organizations and the mechanisms, of course, to face them, to defeat them, have to be multinational. In addition to the solidarity--expressions of solidarity of President Obama, who says that he cannot stand aside from the expressions of threat that is facing a neighbor of his, that vulnerability from an institutional point of view in Mexico and Central America is an issue that also impacts and jeopardizes all of the citizens of North America.
President Obama. Thank you very much, everyone."
"April 15, 2012",The President's News Conference With President Juan Manuel Santos Calderon of Colombia in Cartagena,Barack Obama,"Barack Obama, The President's News Conference With President Juan Manuel Santos Calderon of Colombia in Cartagena Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/300944",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-juan-manuel-santos-calderon-colombia,"President Santos. Good afternoon to you. I'd like to announce that we have had a bilateral meeting with President Obama and his team. This has been highly productive. Colombia and the U.S. have been successful partners in fighting against the drug trafficking, fighting against the terrorism, and in defending democracy.
In this meeting, we have made even more progress. Our countries have moved from being just good friends and partners to become real allies. We are allies in building a new world order. The world of the 20th century is behind; it is in the past. Now there is a new international reality, and we cannot simply be passive observers of this reality. Only joint work of those who share the ideals of freedom and democracy made sure a peaceful transition towards a better world. And we feel that we must work together.
We have talked with President Obama about bilateral problems and world problems, and we have also worked at the Security Council coordinating our positions. And we have been doing this--and we will do it at the G-20, where we will meet in a few months, and here in the summit, in this Summit of the Americas--and we have had very positive results. And I'm not only saying this as president of the summit, but most of the heads of state and government who were present said the same thing. And one of the reasons why it has been so successful was thanks to the presence of President Obama, who stayed here for 2 nights. And we discussed openly and candidly, and with respect and cordiality, all problems. Everything was discussed, and that was really appreciated by Latin America and the Caribbean in a very special fashion. So I'd like to thank you, President Obama. This was part of the success of the summit.
We all have the feeling that there are enormous opportunities to work together in a more integrated fashion. North and South America will be able to find the common denominators that will create synergies for the benefit of the North American and Latin American peoples.
In bilateral relations, I think that we have also made ways as never before, and I'd like to thank you, President Obama, for your permanent willingness and not only working with Colombia, but with Latin America. You said something that really touched us, and you--that was that you did not see Latin America as a problem or Latin Americans living in the U.S. as a problem, but the country--as a contribution, as a supplement to the dynamics that make the U.S. what they are today. And that has a lot of value. We would like to thank you for this. We would like to thank you, not only as Latin Americans who live south of Rio Grande, but those who live--the millions of Latin Americans who live in the U.S.
As for bilateral relations, finally, after working together for a long time in between two countries and their delegations, we can announce today that on May 15, precisely in 1 month, the new FTA with the U.S. will be enforced, which means that there will be thousands and millions of jobs created for the U.S. and Colombia. It is a dream we had for a lot of time. Since I was a Minister of Commerce 20 years ago, we were dreaming of having free trade with the U.S. And this has become a reality today, here in Cartagena, and right here where not so many years ago, about 10 to 12 years, the Plan Colombia was launched.
We were about to be considered a failed state. And today--thanks to the Plan Colombia and thanks to the U.S. and many others and thanks to you, President Obama, for your permanent support that you have always given us--today, we have a very strong democracy that is producing specific results for our peoples and that has been recognized by the world as a whole.
Number two, we also agreed with President Obama to work together so as to help Central American countries in fighting against organized crime and drug trafficking. The experience that we have gathered through Plan Colombia, together with the United States, is something that we have the obligation of sharing with our brothers in Central America who are going through difficult times. So that is a reason why we have decided to strengthen and improve joint assistance mechanisms for these countries.
Number three, we have agreed to work together so as to ensure energy interconnection of the whole continent. And this is something we discussed during the summit, but it concerns us very specifically here. Both the U.S. and Colombia may contribute to that interconnection. I am dreaming that at some point in time no individual living in the Americas will be out of this interconnection, because that will help us a lot in fighting against the poverty and for development.
Number four, we would like to thank the American Government for a decision, which is that as of now visas given to Colombians will be extended to 10 years, which is a proof of trust in the country. And we would like to thank you very much for this not only on behalf of the Government, but on behalf of the 46 million Colombians and the millions of Colombians who would love to go to the U.S.
And that is why I think that we are strengthening this wonderful relations that we have always had with the United States and with you personally, President Obama. You have not only an ally, but a friend. You can count on us. And let's continue working together. We've been able to attain many goals up to date, and I'm sure that we will be able to be more successful in the future.
So again, on behalf of these 46 million people in Colombia and all Latin Americans, thank you very much. Thank you very much for your interest. Thank you very much for coming to the summit and to this bilateral meeting. I think this has been a very important step forward in trying to work together in the Americas and the U.S. and Colombia. Thank you very much.
President Obama. Well, thank you, President Santos, for those warm words. Most of all, thank you and thanks to the First Lady and the people of Colombia and Cartagena for your unbelievable hospitality. This is a beautiful city. And I'm going to do my best to bring Michelle and the girls back to come visit.
This will be remembered as a summit that brought the nations of our hemisphere closer together, and it will be remembered that we advanced the prosperity and the security and dignity of our peoples. And I believe it will be remembered that our progress was made possible in no small part by the outstanding commitment and leadership of President Santos and his team. So, Juan Manuel, muchas gracias.
As I said to my fellow leaders yesterday, there was a time not so long ago when few could have imagined holding a summit like this in Colombia. That we have and that the summit was such a success is a tribute to the remarkable transformation that's occurred in this Nation. There's a level of security that's not been seen in decades. Citizens are reclaiming their communities. The economy is growing, as you can see in the skylines of Cartagena and Bogota. Democratic institutions are being strengthened. In Colombia today, there's hope.
And this progress, once unthinkable, is a tribute to Colombian leaders, including President Santos. It's a testament to the extraordinary courage and sacrifices of Colombian security forces and the Colombian people. And now, as conflict begins to recede, this nation is embracing a new task: consolidating the gains it has won and building a just and durable peace that unlocks Colombia's incredible potential.
Today I pledged to President Santos that as Colombia forges its future, Colombia will continue to have a strong partner in the United States. When we met for the first time 2 years ago, we agreed to take the partnership between our two countries to a new level. This is part of my broader commitment in the Americas to seek partnerships of equality that are based on mutual interest and mutual respect. Here in Colombia and across the region, that's exactly what we've done. And today President Santos and I reviewed our progress and, I'm pleased to say, reached agreement on several new initiatives.
First, as has already been mentioned, we're moving ahead with our landmark trade agreement. In our meeting at the White House last year, we approved an action plan to ensure the protection of labor rights. We all know that more work still needs to be done, but we've made significant progress. And as a result, and given the actions taken by President Santos and the Colombian legislature, I can announce that the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement will enter into force next month on May 15.
As I've said before, this agreement is a win for both our countries. It's a win for the United States by increasing our exports by more than $1 billion, supporting thousands of U.S. jobs, and helping to achieve my goal of doubling U.S. exports. It's a win for Colombia by giving you even greater access to the largest market for your exports: the United States of America. And I'd add that this agreement is a win for our workers and the environment because of the strong protections it has for both, commitments that we are going to fulfill. So, President Santos, thank you for your partnership in getting this done.
Colombia's economic progress puts this nation on the path to join the ranks of developed nations. President Santos has made it a goal to seek membership in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. And today I can announce that when Colombia is ready to seek it, the United States will strongly support Colombia's candidacy for the OECD. Moreover, we will actively encourage other members of the OECD to join us in supporting Colombia's membership, which would be another symbol of Colombia's transformation.
Alongside our deeper economic cooperation, we're strengthening our security cooperation. The United States has been proud to stand with the Colombian people in their fight against a terrorist insurgency that took the lives of so many innocent civilians. I reaffirmed to President Santos that the United States will continue to stand with Colombia shoulder to shoulder as you work to end this conflict and build a just and lasting peace. And that includes supporting President Santos's very ambitious reform agenda, including reparations for victims and land reform. And this afternoon I look forward to joining President Santos as he presents land titles to two Afro-Colombian communities, advancing the vision of a Colombia that is just and equitable.
As Colombia grows stronger at home, it's increasingly playing a leadership role across the region, a third area where we're deepening our partnership. Colombia has shared its expertise in security by training police officers in countries from Latin America to Afghanistan. Today President Santos and I agreed that our two countries will work together to support our partners in Central America as they pursue a regional strategy to improve the security of their citizens.
And this is just one more example of how Colombia is contributing to security and peace beyond its borders, including as a current member of the U.N. Security Council. I want to take this opportunity to salute Colombian leadership, from supporting the recovery in Haiti to supporting sanctions against Iran, to standing up for the rights and freedoms of people in the Middle East and North Africa. And this week in Brazil, we'll join nations from around the world in advancing the open government that empowers citizens and makes governments more accountable.
Finally, I'm very pleased that we're deepening the ties between our peoples. As it now stands, visas for Colombians to visit the United States expire after 5 years. As was just mentioned, I'm announcing that these visas for Colombians will now be valid for 10 years, and this will make it easier for more Colombians to visit and experience the United States. And this is one more very tangible example of Colombia's transformation and the transformation in the relationship between our two countries.
So again, President Santos, thank you to you for your leadership. Thank you to the people of Cartagena and the people of Colombia for this outstanding summit and your great hospitality, the warmth that you've extended us and the other leaders who gathered here. It makes me very confident about Colombia's future.
Cuba/Falkland Islands
President Santos. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Well, there are some questions. I think, RCN TV, Juan Carlos, you have a question.
Q. Presidents, good afternoon. President Obama, today at the closing of the Summit of the Americas, there was great expectation because we never--you never came up with a document that would reflect a decision, and many people would say that Cuba and the Malvinas issue weren't taken up as they should have. Does this have to do in any way with the electoral environment, the electoral context in the United States?
And to President Santos, today that the State Department announced a new security plan for the region. What benefits do you see coming from this plan? Thank you very much.
President Obama. Well, first of all, what it reflects is a lack of consensus among those who participated in the summit. The issue of Cuba I've discussed before. Since I came into office, we have made changes to our Cuba policy. We've increased remittances that are permissible from Cuban Americans sending money to their families to help support them back home. We've increased travel by family members to Cuba. And we have discussed in the OAS the pathway whereby Cuba can fully participate in some of these regional forums. But the fact of the matter is, is that Cuba, unlike the other countries that are participating, has not yet moved to democracy, has not yet observed basic human rights.
I am hopeful that a transition begins to take place inside of Cuba. And I assure you that I and the American people will welcome the time when the Cuban people have the freedom to live their lives, choose their leaders, and fully participate in this global economy and international institutions.
We haven't gotten there yet. But as I indicated to President Santos and all the other leaders in--sitting around the table, we recognize that there may be an opportunity in the coming years, as Cuba begins to look at where it needs to go in order to give its people the kind of prosperity and opportunity that it needs, that it starts loosening up some of the constraints within that country. And that's something that we will welcome.
I'm not somebody who brings to the table here a lot of baggage from the past, and I want to look at all these problems in a new and fresh way. But I also deeply believe in those principles that are contained not just in the OAS charter, but in the United Nations Charter: that respect for individuals, respect for rule of law, respect for human rights that I think is part of the reason that we're seeing an incredible transformation here in Colombia.
And in terms of the Maldives [Malvinas]* or the Falklands, whatever your preferred term, our position on this is that we are going to remain neutral. We have good relations with both Argentina and Great Britain, and we are looking forward to them being able to continue to dialogue on this issue. But this is not something that we typically intervene in.
President Santos. I would just like to repeat something that I said during the press conference this morning--early this afternoon, saying that the important thing of the summit is that we openly discussed all the issues--all issues. This didn't happen before. There were some issues that garnered agreement, others that didn't. We reached an agreement on the five fundamental issues that were identified from the very outset, and the discussion on other issues was an open, candid discussion. It was fully respectful and productive, I would say.
And that is what I--why I believe that in the aftermath of this summit, we will have a better understanding of these challenges. Some will be solved in the short term; others in the longer term. There are others that we will--naturally won't be able to resolve. But that is only natural. And summits such as these, where 33 countries participate, each one bringing to the table their own interests, each one bringing their own prism through which they look at things. But the positive thing is that we discuss these issues candidly and productively, a number of issues that were not even on the table before.
On the issue of security, with the United States, we have very close coordination, and perhaps we don't have this close relationship with any other country in the world. We have learned mutually from each other. They have helped us a great deal. As I said before, Plan Colombia was launched a few years ago. And it's not just the amount of money that was offered through Plan Colombia, it was the quality of the assistance. And to us, that was a very important step. And anything that we can do along that road to improve security in the United States and Colombia and to share our experiences will be more than welcome.
Cuba/U.S. Secret Service/Narcotrafficking
Q. Thank you, both of you. President Obama----
[At this point, there was feedback from the microphone.]
I'm a little close there. Following up on my Colombian colleague's question, could you address--he had referred to the electoral pressures that you face in the United States. Could you address the issue of how big Florida looms in terms of the United States policy towards Cuba?
And I wanted to ask quickly about--the issue that has sort of hung over this summit for the Americans is the controversy that involved members of the detail that is sworn to protect you. What did you--were you angry when you heard about this as you came here? And do you feel like there's any--this is indicative of any broader cultural problem within the Secret Service, such as a leading Republican Congressman suggested?
And President Santos--which, President Obama, you could also address this as well--I'm curious as to why you made drug trafficking such a prominent part of this summit when it could be argued that it detracted some from the attention you wanted to bring to the great progress that Colombia has made on economic and security issues. Thank you.
President Obama. Well, first of all, my position on Cuba has been consistent. It hasn't wavered before I was elected for President the first time, it didn't change after I was elected for President, it hasn't changed now. So let me repeat, separate and apart from whatever electoral concerns you're describing: I want the people of Cuba, like people throughout this hemisphere, to have the opportunity to work, to raise their families, to start a business, to express themselves, to criticize their leaders--something that we in America take full advantage of--to replace them if they're not working, which presumably is the aspiration of, I think, most people throughout Latin America.
And as I indicated in an interview earlier, I am sometimes puzzled by the degree to which countries that themselves have undergone enormous transformations, that have known the oppression of dictatorship or have found themselves on the wrong side of a ruling elite and have suffered for it, why we would ignore that same principle here.
But, Jackie [Jackie Calmes, New York Times], as you know, I tend to be an optimistic person. And it is my hope that as Cuba looks at what's happening in countries like Colombia and Brazil and Chile and throughout the region, they're going to start saying to themselves, maybe there's a new path to take in the 21st century. And when that happens, they're going to have a welcome hand extended by the United States of America.
On the Secret Service, these men and women perform extraordinary service on a day-to-day basis protecting me, my family, U.S. officials. They do very hard work under very stressful circumstances and almost invariably do an outstanding job. And so I'm very grateful to the work that they do.
What happened here in Colombia is being investigated by the Director of the Secret Service. I expect that investigation to be thorough, and I expect it to be rigorous. If it turns out that some of the allegations that have been made in the press are confirmed, then of course, I'll be angry, because my attitude with respect to the Secret Service personnel is no different than what I expect out of my delegation that's sitting here. We're representing the people of the United States. And when we travel to another country, I expect us to observe the highest standards because we're not just representing ourselves, we're here on behalf of our people. And that means that we conduct ourselves with the utmost dignity and probity. And obviously, what's been reported doesn't match up with those standards. But again, I think I'll wait until the full investigation is completed before I pass final judgment.
The final point I'll make, just on the issue you raised with President Santos, about the issue of drug trafficking. I think it is wholly appropriate for us to discuss this issue because Colombia obviously has gone through a wrenching number of years dealing with this issue. It has been successful because of the courage and leadership not only of President Santos and his predecessors, but also because of Colombian security forces.
But you now have a number of countries in the region, in Central America and in the Caribbean, that are smaller, that have fewer resources, and are starting to feel overwhelmed. And obviously, we've been following what's been happening in Mexico and the violence that's been taking place there as a consequence of these narcotraffickers. So I think it wouldn't make sense for us not to examine what works and what doesn't and to constantly try to refine and ask ourselves, is there something we can do to prevent violence, to weaken these drug traffickers, to make sure that they're not peddling this stuff on our kids and they're not perpetrating violence and corrupting institutions in the region? And I thought it was a good and useful and frank discussion.
As I said a couple of days ago, Jackie, I'm not somebody who believes that legalization is a path to solving this problem. But I do think that we can constantly ask ourselves, are there additional steps we can take to be more creative? And are there ways that we can combine the law enforcement and interdiction approaches that we've successfully partnered with Colombia on with the public health approach that, I think, is important back home, making sure that we're trying to reduce demand, even as we try to choke off supply?
And so I'm looking forward to continuing to have that conversation. And based on the best evidence and the best ideas out there, hopefully, we can continue to strengthen these efforts.
President Santos. If I understood your question correctly, why--it is, why did we place drugs on the agenda when there are other more important things for the summit or things that we should highlight about our country, such as the progress that we've achieved economically and in strengthening our democracy?
The question is well put, but the answer is in your court. The media were the ones that placed such a high level of attention on this issue. I said many times in the interviews that I conducted before this summit, I said I don't want this issue to be the summit's issue; I have no interest in having this issue as the sole summit issue. This is one of many issues that some countries want to put on the table for negotiations.
And what I said before is that, fortunately, during this summit there were no issues that were left off the table, everything was open, and this was one of the issues that was discussed. We discussed it frankly, candidly. We heard positions from President Obama, from the United States, and positions from other countries. And they were all laid out on the table. And I think this is a positive step, and if we can find paths that will provide more effective and cheaper mechanisms to fight against drug trafficking and organized crime, well, let's work on that. But we--it was never our intention for this issue to be the issue of the summit.

President Obama's Visit to Colombia/Colombia-U.S. Relations/Trade
Q. President Obama, good afternoon. President Santos, good afternoon, sir. President Obama, you are the first U.S. President who comes to Colombia and stays 3 days, 2 nights, in the beautiful city of Cartagena. How should Colombia and the world interpret this gesture? Is it an acknowledgment of the levels of security that we have here? Is it a gesture of trust in what President Santos has done? Or can we interpret it as a new phase beginning in relationships--the relations between two countries?
And, President Santos, there are small-businesspeople who are very concerned about the FTA. And what is your plan to deal with that, Mr. President?
President Obama. Well, I think the answer is all of the above. It is--this represents my confidence in the security of Colombia and the progress that's been made. It represents my confidence in President Santos and the work that we've done together, as a culmination of the efforts that we began when we first met a couple of years ago. It highlights the deliverables coming out of this summit, not just the free trade agreement, but all the other work that has been done, such as the increase in the length of visitor visas. And it is consistent with the approach that I indicated I would take when I first came into office when it comes to Latin America and Central America.
This is a fast-growing part of the world. It is our--one of our largest trading partners, the entire region. We have Colombian Americans, Americans who originate from the Dominican Republic, from Guatemala, from Mexico, who are constantly contributing to the vitality and the strength of the United States. And so there is a natural bond that already exists. And it's important that our governments build on that natural bond for the mutual benefit of both nations.
And my expectation is, is that we will continue to see the progress that's been made in this summit in subsequent meetings that we have with Colombia. And I think that Colombia increasingly, precisely because it went through difficult times over these last several years, can end up being a role model for a lot of countries around the region. Because they'll see: You know what, there's hope--even in the midst of violence, even in the midst of difficulty--there's the possibility of breaking through to the other side and achieving greater citizen security and greater prosperity.
And let me just mention, I know you asked the question of President Santos, but on the issue of small businesses, one of the things that I brought to the summit was a proposal that, I think, people are embracing throughout the region, and that is that we begin to focus more on small and medium-sized businesses, on women's businesses, making sure that the benefits of trade don't just go to the largest companies, but also go to smaller entrepreneurs and businesspeople.
Because in today's globalized world there's an opportunity for a small business or a medium-sized business to access a global marketplace and grow rapidly, and that means more jobs here in Colombia, and that means more jobs in the United States. So we don't want trade to just be taking place at this layer up here. We want it to be taking place at every level because we think that's going to be good for both our economies.
President Santos. You asked me about what contingency plan we had to help companies and people who were going to be adversely affected by the FTA. All free trade agreements have winners and they have losers, and in this case, we have many more winners than losers. Employment wins. We will create jobs in Colombia. We estimate that more than 500,000 jobs will be created. We will benefit economic growth. We will--we have estimated that between .5 and 1 percent will be added to our growth rate over the long term, and that will be translated into benefits for the economy--for the Colombians. And we estimate that everybody will benefit from this.
Obviously, there are some sectors that don't traditionally benefit. But small and medium enterprises can be the ones that benefit the most. That happened in Peru, for example, when the Peru-U.S. FTA--we saw a major uptick of the number of SMEs that benefited from this free trade agreement. We hope that that happens in Colombia as well, because thus far, Colombia has per capita exports which are very low. But we still have the great potential to bolster our free trade and our exports in those sectors that are vulnerable--which have been identified as vulnerable--are the focus of a series of policies and efforts that will help them weather the storm, to be transformed, to be more competitive, and to be able to face the competition that will open up with this new FTA. That has happened with every free trade agreement that has been signed in the past. What's important is that the final results yields more benefits than otherwise. And we have no doubts that in this case, it will have more benefits for everyone.
U.S. and Global Economy/Iran
Q. Thank you, sir. Yesterday the President of Brazil was talking about the importance not only of growing the economic pie, but making sure that it's divided more equitably. I wonder how you think that applies within the United States, where the idea of spreading the wealth around isn't always warmly greeted, and how, for example, with this free trade agreement, you make sure that the benefits are widely shared. And if I may, sir, on an unrelated topic, if I could get your reaction to the Prime Minister Netanyahu's comments that the P-5-plus-1 had given Iran a freebie with this additional time.
And for President Santos, what responsibility do you believe the countries of Latin America, especially those that have become more democra","tic, have for helping to bring Cuba into the democratic fold?
President Obama. The goal of any government should be to create security for its citizens and to give them opportunity to achieve prosperity and to pass that prosperity on to their kids. And I'm a strong believer that the free market is the best tool ever invented to create wealth.
But what's true in every country is that we always have to think about whether every single person is getting a fair shot, where they actually have opportunity. Is everybody doing their fair share to support the common efforts that are required to create a platform for growth? Is everybody playing by the same set of rules? And I think the history of the United States, the reason we became an economic superpower is because--not always perfectly, not always consistently, but better than any other country on Earth--we were able to give opportunity to everybody. That's what the American Dream was all about.
So when we have debates now about our tax policy, when we have debates now about the Buffett rule that we've been talking about, where we say if you make a million dollars a year or more you shouldn't pay a lower tax rate than your secretary, that is not an argument about redistribution. That is an argument about growth. Because the history of the United States is we grow best when our growth is broad-based. We grow best when our middle class is strong. We grow best when everybody has opportunity. And that means that somebody who has a great idea and is selling a great product or service, we want them to get rich. That's great. But we also want to make sure that we as a society are investing in that young kid who comes from a poor family, who has incredible talent and might be able to get rich as well.
And that means we've got to build good schools, and we've got to make sure that that child can go to college. And we also want to make sure that we keep our scientific edge, and that means we've got to invest in basic research. And that means that we've got to have some basic safety net, because people are more willing to take risks that are required for the free market to work if they know that if they fall on hardship, if something happens, that there's still some floor that they can't fall beneath and that they'll be able to retire with some dignity and some respect.
And so one of the things that we're going to be talking about over the next several months as we debate the budget and Government spending and the proper role of Government, is just--I want everybody to remember, I'm going to say this repeatedly--this is not an argument about taking from A to give to B. This is not a redistributionist argument that we're making. We're making an argument about how do we grow the economy so that it's going to be prospering in this competitive 21st-century environment. And the only way we're going to do that is if people like me, who have been incredibly blessed, are willing to give a little bit back so that the next generation coming along can succeed as well. And the more people that succeed, the better off the country is going to be.
With respect to the Iranian talks, I've been very clear on this. Iran has violated U.N. Security Council resolutions. They're the only country that's a member of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the NPT, that cannot convince the international community that they are abiding by the rules governing the NPT. And not just the United States, but the world community is now imposing some of the toughest sanctions that we've ever seen, and there are more to come. And it is my view that it would be contrary to the security interests of the United States and destabilizing for the world and the region, if Iran pursues, develops, obtains a nuclear weapon. So I've been very clear, and I've been talking about this quite a bit lately.
What I've also been clear about is that the best way to resolve this issue is diplomatically and my belief that we still have a window in which to resolve this conflict diplomatically. That window is closing, and Iran needs to take advantage of it. But it is absolutely the right thing to do for the U.S. Government, working in concert with the other permanent members of the Security Council, with Germany, with the rest of the world community, to pursue this path.
Part of the reason we've been able to build a strong international coalition that isolates Iran around the nuclear issue is because the world has confidence that I've been sincere and my administration has been sincere about giving Iran an opportunity to pursue peaceful nuclear energy while foreclosing the pursuit of a nuclear weapon. That strengthens our hand. That's part of the reason why we've been able to execute on these strong sanctions. And we're going to keep on seeing if we make progress.
Now, the clock is ticking. And I've been very clear to Iran and to our negotiating partners that we're not going to have these talks just drag out in a stalling process. But so far, at least, we haven't given away anything other than the opportunity for us to negotiate and see if Iran comes to the table in good faith. And the notion that somehow we've given something away or a freebie would indicate that Iran has gotten something. In fact, they've got some of the toughest sanctions that they're going to be facing coming up in just a few months if they don't take advantage of these talks. I hope they do.
Was there a--you guys ask too many questions. I start forgetting.
President Santos.
President Santos. Any foreign policy has a formula: Interests plus principles equals a foreign policy. So how do you combine these interests and principles, and how you defend those principles is what makes a foreign policy. In our case and in the case of many countries--countries that believe in freedom and democracy--we have the obligation to make sure that those principles are applied in every form possible and in every place possible.
But there are different formulas to defend and apply those principles as well. There are certain paths that are more effective than others. In some cases, sanctions may work. Generally, they don't, but they may work in some cases. In some other cases, it has been proven that sanctions are not the solution, and in these cases, we need to then pursue the defense of those principles through other ways.
And in our case, Colombia and other Latin American countries that believe in democracy and believe in freedom, we have the obligation to pursue those principles following the most effective paths. And I believe that that can yield the best results.
President Obama. Thank you very much, everybody.
President Santos. Muchas gracias."
"June 19, 2012",The President's News Conference in Los Cabos,Barack Obama,"Barack Obama, The President's News Conference in Los Cabos Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/301545",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-los-cabos,"The President. I want to begin by thanking my good friend and partner, President Calderon, and the people of Los Cabos and Mexico for their outstanding hospitality and leadership. Mexico is the first Latin American country to host a G-20 summit, and this has been another example of Mexico playing a larger role in world affairs, from the global economy to climate change to development.
Since this is my last visit to Mexico during President Calderon's time in office, I want to say how much I've valued Felipe's friendship and the progress that we've made together over the past several years. And building on the spirit here at Los Cabos, I'm absolutely confident that the deep ties between our countries will only grow stronger in the years to come.
Now, over the past 3 years, these G-20 summits have allowed our nations to pull the global economy back from a free fall and put us back on the path of recovery and growth. In the United States, our businesses have created jobs for 27 months in a row--more than 4 million jobs in all--and our highest priority continues to be putting people back to work even faster.
Today, we recognize that there are a wide range of threats to our ongoing global economic recovery and growth. But the one that's received the most focus obviously and that is having a significant impact on the United States as well as globally is the situation in Europe. As our largest trading partner, slower growth in Europe means slower growth in American jobs. So we have a profound interest in seeing Europe prosper. That's why I've been consulting closely with my European counterparts during this crisis, as we've done here at Los Cabos.
I do think it's important to note, however, that most leaders of the euro zone, the economies are not part of the G-20. The challenges facing Europe will not be solved by the G-20 or by the United States. The solutions will be debated and decided, appropriately, by the leaders and the people of Europe.
So this has been an opportunity for us to hear from European leaders on the progress they're making and on their next steps, especially in the wake of the election in Greece, and because they're heading into the EU summit later this month. It's also been a chance for the international community, including the United States--the largest economy in the world, and with our own record of responding to financial crises--to stress the importance of decisive action at this moment.
Now, markets around the world as well as governments have been asking if Europe is ready to do what is necessary to hold the euro zone together. Over the last 2 days, European leaders here in Cabos have made it clear that they understand the stakes and they pledged to take the actions needed to address this crisis and restore confidence, stability, and growth. Let me just be a little more specific.
First, our friends in Europe clearly grasp the seriousness of the situation and are moving forward with a heightened sense of urgency. I welcome the important steps that they have already taken to promote growth, financial stability, and fiscal responsibility. I'm very pleased that the European leaders here said that they will take all necessary measures to safeguard the integrity and stability of the euro zone, to improve the functioning of the financial markets. And this will contribute to breaking the feedback loop between sovereigns and banks and make sovereign borrowing costs sustainable.
I also welcome the adoption of the fiscal compact and its ongoing implementation, assessed on a structural basis, together with a growth strategy, which includes structural reforms.
G-20 leaders all supported Europe working in partnership with the next Greek Government to ensure that they remain on a path to reform and sustainability within the euro zone. Another positive step forward was the euro zone's commitment to work on a more integrated financial architecture, including banking supervision, resolution, and recapitalization, as well as deposit insurance. Also, in the coming days, Spain will lay out the details of its financial support request for its banks restructuring agency, providing clarity to reassure markets on the form and the amount and the structure of support to be approved at the earliest time.
It's also positive that the euro zone will pursue structural reforms to strengthen competitiveness in deficit countries and to promote demand and growth in surplus countries to reduce imbalances within the euro area.
And finally, I welcome the fact that Europe is determined to move forward quickly on measures to support growth and investment including by completing the European single market and making better use of European funds.
Of course, Europe is not, as I said, the only source of concern when it comes to global growth. The G-20 also agreed that reversing the economic slowdown demands a renewed focus on growth and job creation.
As the world's largest economy, the best thing the United States can do is to create jobs and growth in the short term, even as we continue to put our fiscal house in order over the long term. And as part of that effort, we've made significant progress in advancing our trade agenda. This is an essential to promoting growth, innovation and jobs in the United States.
Here in Los Cabos, we announced important steps towards closer integration with three of our major trading partners. Both Mexico and Canada have been invited to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, which is an ambitious 21st-century trade agreement that will now include 11 countries. And this agreement holds enormous opportunities to boost trade in one of the world's fastest growing regions.
Even as we build this new framework for trade in the Asia-Pacific, we're also working to expand our trade with Europe. So today the United States and the European Union agreed to take the next step in our work towards the possible launching of negotiations on an agreement to strengthen our already very deep trade and investment partnership.
In addition, and in keeping with our commitments at the last G-20 in Cannes, we agreed that countries should not intervene to hold their currencies at undervalued levels and that countries with large surpluses and export-oriented economies needed to continue to boost demand.
So, in closing, I'd note that with Mexico's leadership, we continue to make progress across a range of challenges that are vital to our shared prosperity, from food security to green economic growth that combats climate change, from financial education and protection for consumers to combating corruption that stifles economic growth, and in strengthening financial regulation to creating a more level playing field. All of this happened in large part because of the leadership of President Calderon. I want to thank him, and I want to thank my fellow leaders for their partnership as we work very hard to create jobs and opportunity that all of our citizens deserve.
So with that, I'm going to start with Ben Feller of AP [Associated Press].
Economic Stabilization Efforts in Europe/U.S. Economy
Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. We're all hearing a lot of encouraging promises about what Europe plans to do, but can you assure us that those actions, if they're able to come together on them, will actually do anything to create jobs in America this year? And if Europe is not able to rally in a big way pretty quickly, do you think that will cost you the election?
The President. Well, first of all, I think that what I've heard from European leaders during the course of these discussions is they understand the stakes. They understand why it's important for them to take bold and decisive action. And I'm confident that they can meet those tests.
Now, I always show great sympathy for my European friends because they don't have to deal with one Congress; they have to deal with 17 Parliaments, if you're talking about the euro zone. If you're talking about the European Union, you're talking about 27. And that means that sometimes, even after they've conceived of approaches to deal with the crisis, they have to work through all the politics to get it done. And markets are a lot more impatient.
And so what I've encouraged them to do is to lay out a framework for where they want to go in increasing European integration, in resolving the financial pressures that are on sovereign countries. Even if they can't achieve all of it in one full swoop, I think if people have a sense of where they're going, that can provide confidence and break the fever. Because if you think about Europe, look, this remains one of the wealthiest, most productive regions of the world. Europe continues to have enormous strengths: a very well educated, productive workforce. They have some of the biggest, best run companies in the world. They have trading relationships around the world. And all of these problems that they're facing right now are entirely solvable, but the markets, when they start seeing potential uncertainty, show a lot more risk aversion, and you can start getting into a negative cycle.
And what we have to do is it to create a positive cycle, where people become more confident, the markets settle down, and they have the time and the space to execute the kinds of structural reforms that not only Europe, but all of us are having to go through, in balancing the need for growth, but also dealing with issues like debt and deficits. And I'm confident that over the next several weeks, Europe will paint a picture of where we need to go, take some immediate steps that are required to give them that time and space. And based on the conversations that I've had here today and the conversations that I've had over the last several months, I'm confident that they are very much committed to the European project.
Now, all this affects the United States. Europe as a whole is our largest trading partner. And if fewer folks are buying stuff in Paris or Berlin, that means that we're selling less stuff made in Pittsburgh or Cleveland. But I think there are a couple of things that we've already done that help. The financial regulatory reforms that we passed means that our banks are better capitalized. It means that our supervision and our mechanisms for looking at trouble spots in our financial system are superior to what they were back in 2008. That's an important difference. But there's still some more things we can do.
And the most important thing we can do is something that I've already talked about. If Congress would act on a jobs plan that independent economists say would put us on the path of creating an extra million jobs on top of the ones that have already been created--putting teachers back in the classroom, putting construction workers back on the job rebuilding infrastructure that badly needs to be rebuilt--all those things can make a significant difference. And given that we don't have full control over what happens in Europe or the pace at which things happen in Europe, let's make sure that we're doing those things that we do have control over and that are good policy anyway.
2012 Presidential Election
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. I think it's fair to say that any--all these issues, economic issues, will potentially have some impact on the election. But that's not my biggest concern right now. My biggest concern is the same concern I've had over the last 3 1/2 years, which is folks who are out of work or underemployed or unable to pay the bills, what steps are we taking that potentially put them in a stronger position. And I've consistently believed that if we take the right policy steps, if we're doing the right thing, then the politics will follow. And my mind hasn't changed on that.
Jeff Mason, Reuters. Where's Jeff?
Situation in Syria
Q. Thank you, sir. My question is about Syria. Did President Putin of Russia indicate any desire on Russia's part for Asad to step down or to leave power? And did you make any tangible progress in your meetings with him or with Chinese President Hu in finding a way to stop the bloodshed there?
The President. Right. Well, these were major topics of conversation in both meetings. And anybody who's seen scenes of what's happening in Syria I think recognizes that the violence is completely out of hand, that civilians are being targeted, and that Asad has lost legitimacy. And when you massacre your own citizens in the ways that we've seen, it is impossible to conceive of a orderly political transition that leaves Asad in power.
Now, that doesn't mean that that process of political transition is easy. And there's no doubt that Russia, which historically has had a relationship with Syria, as well as China, which is generally wary of commenting on what it considers to be the internal affairs of other countries, are and have been more resistant to applying the kind of pressure that's necessary to achieve that political transition.
We had a very candid conversation. I wouldn't suggest that at this point the United States and the rest of the international community are aligned with Russia and China in their positions, but I do think they recognize the grave dangers of all-out civil war. I do not think they condone the massacres that we've witnessed. And I think they believe that everybody would be better served if Syria had a mechanism for ceasing the violence and creating a legitimate government.
What I've said to them is that it's important for the world community to work with the United Nations and Kofi Annan on what a political transition would look like. And my hope is, is that we can have those conversations in the coming week or two and that we can present to the world, but most importantly, to the Syrian people, a pathway whereby this conflict can be resolved.
But I don't think it would be fair to say that the Russians and the Chinese are signed on at this point. I think what is fair to say is that they recognize that the current situation is grave; it does not serve their interests; it certainly does not serve the interests of the Syrian people. And where we agree is that if we can help the Syrian people find a path to a resolution, all of us would be better off.
But it's my personal belief--and I shared this with them--that I don't see a scenario in which Asad stays and violence is reduced. He had an opportunity with the Annan plan. They did not fulfill their side of the deal. Instead we saw escalation and murder of innocent women and children. And at this point, we have the international monitors that were sent in having to leave because of this violence that's being perpetrated. And although you'll hear sometimes from some commentators that the opposition has engaged in violence as well, and obviously, there's evidence of that, I think it's also fair to say that those haunting images that we saw in places like Hom were the direct result of decisions made by the Syrian Government and ultimately Mr. Asad is responsible.
Q. Did either of them talk about Syria without Asad?
The President. We had an intensive conversation about it. If you're asking me whether they signed on to that proposition, I don't think it would be fair to say that they are there yet. But my--I'm going to keep on making the argument, and my expectation is, is that at some point there's a recognition that it's hard to envision a better future for Syria while Asad is still there.
Julianna Goldman [Bloomberg News].
Economic Stabilization Efforts in Europe
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. One of Mitt Romney's economic advisers recently wrote in a German publication that your recommendations to Europe and to Germany in particular reveal ignorance of the causes of the crisis, and he said that they have the same flaws as your own economic policies. I want to get your response to that and also to follow up on Ben's question. Europe has been kicking the can down the road for years, so why are you any more convinced that we won't see another 3-month fix emerge out of Brussels at the end of the month?
The President. Well, first of all, with respect to Mr. Romney's advisers, I suggest you go talk to Mr. Romney about his advisers. I would point out that we have one President at a time and one administration at a time, and I think traditionally the notion has been that America's political differences end at the water's edge. I'd also suggest that he may not be familiar with what our suggestions to the Germans have been. And I think sometimes back home there is a desire to superimpose whatever ideological arguments are taking place back home on to a very complicated situation in Europe.
The situation in Europe is a combination of things. You've got situations where some countries did have undisciplined fiscal practices, public debt. You had some countries like Spain whose problems actually arose out of housing speculation and problems in the private sector that didn't have to do with public debt.
I think that there's no doubt that all the countries in Europe at this point recognize the need for growth strategies inside of Europe that are consistent with fiscal consolidation plans. And by the way, that's exactly what I think the United States should be thinking about. The essence of the plan that I presented back in September was how do we increase growth and jobs now while providing clarity in terms of how we reduce our deficit and our debt, medium and long term.
And I think that's the right recipe generally, not just for us, but across the board.
You had a second question. What was it?
Q. Why are you--[inaudible]?
The President. Why am I confident? Well, look, I don't want to sound Pollyannish here. Resolving the issues in Europe is difficult. As I said, there are a lot of players involved. There are a lot of complexities to the problems, because we're talking about the problems of a bunch of different countries at this point. Changing market psychology is very difficult. But the tools are available. The sense of urgency among the leaders is clear. And so what we have to do is combine that sense of urgency with the tools that are available and bridge them in a timely fashion that can provide markets confidence. And I think that can be done.
Hopefully, just to give an example, when Spain clarifies exactly how it intends to draw down and utilize dollars--or not dollars, but euros to recapitalize its banking system, given that it's already got support from other European countries, given that the resources are available, what's missing right now is just a sense of specifics and the path whereby that takes place. When markets see that, that can help build confidence and reverse psychology.
So there are going to be a range of steps that they can take. None of them are going to be a silver bullet that solves this thing entirely over the next week or 2 weeks or 2 months. But each step points to the fact that Europe is moving towards further integration rather than breakup and that these problems can be resolved and points to the underlying strength in Europe's economies.
These are not countries that somehow at their core are unproductive or dysfunctional; these are advanced economies with extraordinarily productive people. They've got a particular challenge that has to do with a currency union that didn't have all the best bells and whistles of a fiscal or a monetary union, and they're catching up now to some of those needs. And they just need the time and the space to do it. In the meantime, they've got to send a strong signal to the market, and I'm confident they can do that.
All right. Thank you very much, everybody."
"April 30, 2013",The President's News Conference,Barack Obama,"Barack Obama, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/304110",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1154,"The President. Good afternoon—or good morning, everybody. I am here to answer questions in honor of Ed Henry [FOX News], as he wraps up his tenure as president of the White House Correspondents' Association.
Ed, because of that, you get the first question. Congratulations.
Q. Thank you, sir, I really appreciate that. And I hope we can go back to business and being mad at each other a little bit. [Laughter]
The President. I'm never mad at you.
Q. Okay, good. Thank you, I appreciate that.
The President. You may be mad at me. [Laughter]
Syria
Q. I'm not. A couple of questions on national security. On Syria, you said that the red line was not just about chemical weapons being used, but being spread, and it was a game changer. It seemed cut and dried And now your administration seems to be suggesting that line is not clear. Do you risk U.S. credibility if you don't take military action?
And then on Benghazi, there are some survivors of that terror attack who say they want to come forward and testify—some in your State Department—and they say they've been blocked. Will you allow them to testify?
The President. Well, first of all, on Syria, I think it's important to understand that for several years now, what we've been seeing is a slowly unfolding disaster for the Syrian people. And this is not a situation in which we've been simply bystanders to what's been happening. My policy from the beginning has been that President Asad had lost credibility, that he attacked his own people, has killed his own people, unleashed a military against innocent civilians, and that the only way to bring stability and peace to Syria is going to be for Asad to step down and to move forward on a political transition.
In pursuit of that strategy, we've organized the international community. We are the largest humanitarian donor. We have worked to strengthen the opposition. We have provided nonlethal assistance to the opposition. We have applied sanctions on Syria. So there are a whole host of steps that we've been taking precisely because, even separate from the chemical weapons issue, what's happening in Syria is a blemish on the international community generally, and we've got to make sure that we're doing everything we can to protect the Syrian people.
In that context, what I've also said is that the use of chemical weapons would be a game changer, not simply for the United States, but for the international community. And the reason for that is that we have established international law and international norms that say when you use these kinds of weapons, you have the potential of killing massive numbers of people in the most inhumane way possible, and the proliferation risks are so significant that we don't want that genie out of the bottle. So when I said that the use of chemical weapons would be a game changer, that wasn't unique to—that wasn't a position unique to the United States, and it shouldn't have been a surprise.
And what we now have is evidence that chemical weapons have been used inside of Syria, but we don't know how they were used, when they were used, who used them. We don't have a chain of custody that establishes what exactly happened. And when I am making decisions about America's national security and the potential for taking additional action in response to chemical weapon use, I've got to make sure I've got the facts. That's what the American people would expect.
And if we end up rushing to judgment without hard, effective evidence, then we can find ourselves in a position where we can't mobilize the international community to support what we do. There may be objections even among some people in the region who are sympathetic with the opposition if we take action. So it's important for us to do this in a prudent way.
And what I've said to my team is we've got to do everything we can to investigate and establish with some certainty what exactly has happened in Syria, what is happening in Syria. We will use all the assets and resources that we have at our disposal. We'll work with the neighboring countries to see whether we can establish a clear baseline of facts. And we've also called on the United Nations to investigate.
But the important point I want to make here is that we already are deeply engaged in trying to bring about a solution in Syria. It is a difficult problem. But even if chemical weapons were not being used in Syria, we'd still be thinking about tens of thousands of people, innocent civilians—women, children—who've been killed by a regime that's more concerned about staying in power than it is about the well-being of its people. And so we are already deeply invested in trying to find a solution here.
What is true, though, is, is that if I can establish in a way that not only the United States, but also the international community feel confident is the use of chemical weapons by the Asad regime, then that is a game changer because what that portends is potentially even more devastating attacks on civilians, and it raises the strong possibility that those chemical weapons can fall into the wrong hands and get disseminated in ways that would threaten U.S. security or the security of our allies.
Q. By game changer, you mean U.S. military action?
The President. By game changer, I mean that we would have to rethink the range of options that are available to us.
Now, we're already, as I've said, invested in trying to bring about a solution inside of Syria. Obviously, there are options that are available to me that are on the shelf right now that we have not deployed. And that's a spectrum of options. As early as last year, I asked the Pentagon, our military, our intelligence officials to prepare for me what options might be available. And I won't go into the details of what those options might be, but clearly, that would be an escalation, in our view, of the threat to the security of the international community, our allies, and the United States, and that means that there are some options that we might not otherwise exercise that we would strongly consider.
2012 Attack on the U.S. Mission in Benghazi, Libya
Q. And on the Benghazi question, I know pieces of this story have been litigated, and you've been asked about it. But there are people in your own State Department saying they've been blocked from coming forward, that they survived the terror attack, and they want to tell their story. Will you help them come forward and just say it once and for all?
The President. Ed, I'm not familiar with this notion that anybody has been blocked from testifying. So what I'll do is I will find out what exactly you're referring to. What I've been very clear about from the start is that our job with respect to Benghazi has been to find out exactly what happened, to make sure that U.S. Embassies not just in the Middle East, but around the world are safe and secure, and to bring those who carried it out to justice.
But I'll find out what exactly you're referring to.
Q. They've hired an attorney because they're saying that they've been blocked from coming forward.
The President. I'm not familiar with it.
Q. Okay.
The President. Jessica [Jessica Yellin, CNN].
Terrorist Attack in Boston, Massachusetts
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. There's a report that your Director of National Intelligence has ordered a broad review—this is regards to the Boston Marathon bombing—that your DNI has ordered a broad review of all the intelligence gathering prior to the attack. There is also a series of senators—Susan Collins, Saxby Chambliss, Lindsey Graham—who allege that all these years after 9/11, there still wasn't enough intelligence shared prior to the attack. And now, Lindsey Graham, who is a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, has said that Benghazi and Boston are both examples of the U.S. going backwards on national security. Is he right? And did our intelligence miss something?
The President. No, Mr. Graham is not right on this issue, although I'm sure it generated some headlines.
I think that what we saw in Boston was State, local, Federal officials, every agency rallying around a city that had been attacked, identifying the perpetrators just hours after the scene had been examined. We now have one individual deceased, one in custody. Charges have been brought.
I think that all our law enforcement officials performed in an exemplary fashion after the bombing had taken place. And we should be very proud of their work, as obviously we're proud of the people of Boston and all the first responders and the medical personnel that helped save lives.
What we also know is that the Russian intelligence services had alerted U.S. intelligence about the older brother as well as the mother, indicating that they might be sympathizers to extremists. The FBI investigated that older brother. It's not as if the FBI did nothing. They not only investigated the older brother, they interviewed the older brother. They concluded that there were no signs that he was engaging in extremist activity. So that much we know.
And the question then is, was there something that happened that triggered radicalization and actual—an actual decision by the brother to engage in the attack that we—the tragic attack we actually saw in Boston? And are there things—additional things that could have been done in that interim that might have prevented it?
Now, what Director Clapper is doing is standard procedure around here, which is when an event like this happens, we want to go back and we want to review every step that was taken. We want to leave no stone unturned. We want to see, is there, in fact, additional protocols and procedures that could be put in place that would further improve and enhance our ability to detect a potential attack? And we won't know that until that review is completed. We won't know that until the investigation of the actual crime is fully completed. And that's still ongoing.
But what I can say is, is that based on what I've seen so far, the FBI performed its duties, the Department of Homeland Security did what it was supposed to be doing.
But this is hard stuff. And I've said for quite some time that because of the pressure that we've put on Al Qaida core, because of the pressure that we've put on these networks that are well financed and more sophisticated and can engage in and project transnational threats against the United States, one of the dangers that we now face are self-radicalized individuals who are already here in the United States, in some cases, may not be part of any kind of network, but because of whatever warped, twisted ideas they may have, may decide to carry out an attack. And those are in some ways more difficult to prevent.
And so what I've done for months now is to indicate to our entire counterterrorism team, what more can we do on that threat that is looming on the horizon? Are there more things that we can do, whether it's engaging in communities—engaging with communities where there's a potential for self-radicalization at this—of this sort? Is there work that can be done in terms of detection? But all of this has to be done in the context of our laws, due process.
And so part of what Director Clapper is doing, then, is going to be to see if we can determine any lessons learned from what happened.
Counterterrorism Cooperation With Russia/Terrorism
Q. Are you getting all the intelligence and information you need from the Russians? And should Americans be worried when they go to big, public events now?
The President. The Russians have been very cooperative with us since the Boston bombing. Obviously, old habits die hard; there's still suspicions sometimes between our intelligence and law enforcement agencies that date back 10, 20, 30 years, back to the cold war. But they're continually improving. I've spoken to President Putin directly. He's committed to working with me to make sure that those who report to us are cooperating fully in not only this investigation, but how do we work on counterterrorism issues generally.
In terms of what—the response of the American people, I think everybody can take a cue from Boston. You don't get a sense that anybody is intimidated when they go to Fenway Park a couple days after the bombing. There are joggers right now, I guarantee you, all throughout Boston and Cambridge and Watertown. And I think one of the things that I've been most proud of in watching the country's response to the terrible tragedy there, is a sense of resilience and toughness. And we're not going to be intimidated. We are going to live our lives.
And people, I think, understand that we've got to do everything we can to prevent these kinds of attacks from taking place, but people also understand—in the same way they understand after a shooting in Aurora or Newtown or Virginia Tech or after the foiled attempts in Times Square or in Detroit—that we're not going to stop living our lives because warped, twisted individuals try to intimidate us. We're going to do what we do, which is go to work, raise our kids, go to ball games, run in marathons. And at the same time, we're going to make sure that everybody is cooperating and is vigilant in doing everything we can, without being naive, to try to prevent these attacks from happening in the future.
Jonathan Karl [ABC News].
President's Policy Agenda/Budget Control Act of 2011
Q. Mr. President, you are a hundred days into your second term. On the gun bill, you put, it seems, everything into it to try to get it passed. Obviously, it didn't. Congress has ignored your efforts to try to get them to undo these sequester cuts. There was even a bill that you threatened to veto that got 92 Democrats in the House voting yes. So my question to you is, do you still have the juice to get the rest of your agenda through this Congress?
The President. If you put it that way, Jonathan—[laughter]—maybe I should just pack up and go home. Golly.
I think it's a little—as Mark Twain said, rumors of my demise may be a little exaggerated at this point.
We understand that we're in a divided Government right now. The Republicans control the House of Representatives. In the Senate, this habit of requiring 60 votes for even the most modest piece of legislation has gummed up the works there. And I think it comes to no surprise not even to the American people, but even Members of Congress themselves that right now things are pretty dysfunctional up on Capitol Hill.
Despite that, I'm actually confident that there are a range of things that we're going to be able to get done. I feel confident that the bipartisan work that's been done on immigration reform will result in a bill that passes the Senate, passes the House, and gets on my desk. And that's going to be a historic achievement. And I'm—I've been very complimentary of the efforts of both Republicans and Democrats in those efforts.
It is true that the sequester is in place right now. It's damaging our economy. It's hurting our people. And we need to lift it. What's clear is, is that the only way we're going to lift it is if we do a bigger deal that meets the test of lowering our deficit and growing our economy at the same time. And that's going to require some compromises on the part of both Democrats and Republicans.
I've had some good conversations with Republican Senators so far. Those conversations are continuing. I think there's a genuine desire on many of their parts to move past not only sequester, but Washington dysfunction. Whether we can get it done or not, we'll see.
But I think the sequester is a good example—or this recent FAA issue is a good example. You will recall that even as recently as my campaign, Republicans we're saying, sequester is terrible, this is a disaster, it's going to ruin our military, it's going to be disastrous for the economy, we've got to do something about it. Then, when it was determined that doing something about it might mean that we close some tax loopholes for the wealthy and the well connected, suddenly, well, you know what, we'll take the sequester. And the notion was somehow that we had exaggerated the effects of the sequester, remember? The President's crying wolf. He's Chicken Little. The sequester, no problem.
And then in rapid succession, suddenly White House tours, this is terrible! How can we let that happen? Meat inspectors, we've got to fix that. And most recently, what are we going to do about potential delays at airports?
So despite the fact that a lot of Members of Congress were suggesting that somehow the sequester was a victory for them and this wouldn't hurt the economy, what we now know is that what I warned earlier, what Jay stood up here and warned repeatedly, is happening. It's slowed our growth. It's resulting in people being thrown out of work. And it's hurting folks all across the country.
And the fact that Congress responded to the short-term problem of flight delays by giving us the option of shifting money that's designed to repair and improve airports over the long term to fix the short-term problem, well, that's not a solution. So—and essentially, what we've done is we've said, in order to avoid delays this summer, we're going to ensure delays for the next two or three decades.
Q. Why'd you go along with it?
Federal Aviation Administration/Budget Control Act of 2011
The President. Well, hold on a second.
So the alternative, of course, is either to go ahead and impose a whole bunch of delays on passengers now—which also does not fix the problem—or the third alternative is to actually fix the problem by coming up with a broader, larger deal.
But, Jonathan, you seem to suggest that somehow, these folks over there have no responsibilities and that my job is to somehow get them to behave. That's their job. They're elected; Members of Congress are elected in order to do what's right for their constituencies and for the American people.
So if, in fact, they are seriously concerned about passenger convenience and safety, then they shouldn't just be thinking about tomorrow or next week or the week after that; they should be thinking about what's going to happen five years from now, 10 years from now, or 15 years from now. The only way to do that is for them to engage with me on coming up with a broader deal. And that's exactly what I'm trying to do, is to continue to talk to them about are there ways for us to fix this.
Frankly, I don't think that if I were to veto, for example, this FAA bill, that that somehow would lead to the broader fix. It just means that there'd be pain now, which they would try to blame on me, as opposed to pain 5 years from now. But either way, the problem is not getting fixed.
The only way the problem does get fixed is if both parties sit down and they say: How are we going to make sure that we're reducing our deficit sensibly? How are we making sure that we're investing in things like rebuilding our airports and our roads and our bridges and investing in early childhood education, all the—basic research, all the things that are going to help us grow? And that's what the American people want.
Just one interesting statistic when it comes to airports. There was a recent survey of the top airports in the country—in the world, and there was not a single U.S. airport that came in the top 25. Not one. Not one U.S. airport was considered by the experts and consumers who use these airports to be in the top 25 in the world. I think Cincinnati Airport came in around 30th.
What does that say about our long-term competitiveness and future? And so when folks say, well, there was some money in the FAA to deal with these furloughs, well, yes, the money is this pool of funds that are supposed to try to upgrade our airports so we don't rank in the bottom of industrialized countries when it comes to our infrastructure.
And that's what we're doing; we're using our seed corn short term. And the only reason we're doing it is because right now we've got folks who are unwilling to make some simple changes to our Tax Code, for example, to close loopholes that aren't adding to our competitiveness and aren't helping middle class families.
So I'm—that's a long way of answering your question, but the point is that there are commonsense solutions to our problems right now. I cannot force Republicans to embrace those commonsense solutions. I can urge them to. I can put pressure on them. I can rally the American people around those commonsense solutions. But ultimately, they, themselves, are going to have to say, we want to do the right thing.
And I think there are Members certainly in the Senate right now, and I suspect Members in the House as well, who understand that deep down. But they're worried about their politics. It's tough. Their base thinks that compromise with me is somehow a betrayal. They're worried about primaries. And I understand all that. And we're going to try to do everything we can to create a permission structure for them to be able to do what's going to be best for the country. But it's going to take some time.

Detention Facilities at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba
Q. Mr. President, as you're probably aware, there's a growing hunger strike on Guantanamo Bay among prisoners there. Is it any surprise really that they would prefer death rather than have no end in sight to their confinement?
The President. Well, it is not a surprise to me that we've got problems in Guantanamo, which is why when I was campaigning in 2007 and 2008, and when I was elected in 2008, I said we need to close Guantanamo. I continue to believe that we've got to close Guantanamo.
Q. [Inaudible]—can do it?
The President. Well, I think it is critical for us to understand that Guantanamo is not necessary to keep America safe. It is expensive. It is inefficient. It hurts us in terms of our international standing. It lessens cooperation with our allies on counterterrorism efforts. It is a recruitment tool for extremists. It needs to be closed.
Now, Congress determined that they would not let us close it and despite the fact that there are a number of the folks who are currently in Guantanamo, who the courts have said could be returned to their country of origin or potentially a third country.
I'm going to go back at this. I've asked my team to review everything that's currently being done in Guantanamo, everything that we can do administratively. And I'm going to reengage with Congress to try to make the case that this is not something that's in the best interests of the American people. And it's not sustainable.
I mean, the notion that we're going to continue to keep over a hundred individuals in a no-man's land in perpetuity, even at a time when we've wound down the war in Iraq, we're winding down the war in Afghanistan, we're having success defeating Al Qaida core, we've kept the pressure up on all these transnational terrorist networks, when we've transferred detention authority in Afghanistan—the idea that we would still maintain forever a group of individuals who have not been tried, that is contrary to who we are, it is contrary to our interests, and it needs to stop.
Now, it's a hard case to make because I think for a lot of Americans, the notion is out of sight, out of mind. And it's easy to demagogue the issue. That's what happened the first time this came up. I'm going to go back at it because I think it's important.
Q. Meanwhile, you continue to force-feed these folks so they don't die?
The President. I don't want these individuals to die. Obviously, the Pentagon is trying to manage the situation as best as they can. But I think all of us should reflect on why exactly are we doing this? Why are we doing this? I mean, we've got a whole bunch of individuals who have been tried who are currently in maximum security prisons around the country. Nothing's happened to them. Justice has been served. It's been done in a way that's consistent with our Constitution, consistent with due process, consistent with rule of law, consistent with our traditions.
The individual who attempted to bomb Times Square: in prison, serving a life sentence. The individual who tried to bomb a plane in Detroit: in prison, serving a life sentence. A Somali who was part of Al Shabaab, who we captured: in prison. So we can handle this.
And I understand that in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, with the traumas that had taken place, why, for a lot of Americans, the notion was somehow that we had to create a special facility like Guantanamo and we couldn't handle this in a normal, conventional fashion. I understand that reaction. But we're now over a decade out. We should be wiser. We should have more experience in how we prosecute terrorists.
And this is a lingering problem that is not going to get better. It's going to get worse. It's going to fester. And so I'm going to, as I said before, examine every option that we have administratively to try to deal with this issue, but ultimately, we're also going to need some help from Congress, and I'm going to ask some folks over there who care about fighting terrorism, but also care about who we are as a people to step up and help me on it.
Chuck Todd [NBC News].
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
Q. Mr. President, thank you. Max Baucus, Democratic Senator, referred to the implementation of your health care law as a potential train wreck. You've had other Democrats been whispering nervousness about the implementation and the impact—and it's all self centered a little bit, the impact that it might have on their own political campaigns in 2014. Why do you think—just curious—why does Senator Baucus, somebody who ostensibly helped write your bill, believe that this is going to be a train wreck? And why do you believe he's wrong?
The President. Well, I think that any time you're implementing something big, there's going to be people who are nervous and anxious about, is it going to get done, until it's actually done.
But let's just step back for a second and make sure the American people understand what it is that we're doing. The Affordable Care Act—Obamacare—has now been with us for 3 years. It's gone through Supreme Court tests. It's gone through efforts to repeal. A huge chunk of it has already been implemented. And for the 85 to 90 percent of Americans who already have health insurance, they're already experiencing most of the benefits of the Affordable Care Act even if they don't know it. Their insurance is more secure. Insurance companies can't drop them for bad reasons. Their kids are able to stay on their health insurance until they're 26 years old. They're getting free preventive care.
So there are a whole host of benefits that, for the average American out there—for the 85 to 90 percent of Americans who already have health insurance—this thing's already happened. And their only impact is that their insurance is stronger, better, more secure than it was before. Full stop. That's it. They don't have to worry about anything else.
The implementation issues come in for those who don't have health insurance, maybe because they have a preexisting condition and the only way they can get health insurance is to go out on the individual market, and they're paying 50 percent or 100 percent more than those of us who are lucky enough to have group plans; people who are too poor to get health insurance and the employers don't offer them. Maybe they work for a small business, and this small business can't afford right now to provide health insurance.
So all the implementation issues that are coming up are implementation issues related to that small group of people, 10 to 15 percent of Americans—now, it's still 30 million Americans, but a relatively narrow group—who don't have health insurance right now or are on the individual market and are paying exorbitant amounts for coverage that isn't that great.
And what we're doing is we're setting up a pool so that they can all pool together and get a better deal from insurance companies. And those who can't afford it, we're going to provide them with some subsidies. That's it. I mean, that's what's left to implement, because the other stuff has been implemented and it's working fine.
The challenge is that setting up a market-based system—basically, an online marketplace where you can go on and sign up and figure out what kind of insurance you can afford and figuring out how to get the subsidies—that's still a big, complicated piece of business. And when you're doing it nationwide, relatively fast, and you've got half of Congress who is determined to try to block implementation and not adequately funding implementation, and then you've got a number of members of—or Governors, Republican Governors who know that it's bad politics for them to try to implement this effectively and some even who have decided to implement it and then their Republican-controlled State legislatures say, don't implement and won't pass enabling legislation, when you have that kind of situation, that makes it harder.
But having said all that, we've got a great team in place. We are pushing very hard to make sure that we're hitting all the deadlines and the benchmarks.
I'll give you an example, a recent example. We put together, initially, an application form for signing up for participation in the exchanges that was initially about 21 pages long, and immediately, everybody sat around the table and said, well, this is too long. Especially in this age of the Internet, people aren't going to have the patience to sit there for hours on end. Let's streamline this thing. So we cut what was a 21-page form now down to a form that's about 3 pages for an individual, a little more than that for a family, well below the industry average. So those kinds of refinements we're going to continue to be working on.
But I think the main message I want to give to the American people here is, despite all the hue and cry and sky-is-falling predictions about this stuff,"," if you've already got health insurance, then that part of Obamacare that affects you, it's pretty much already in place. And that's about 85 percent of the country.
What is left to be implemented is those provisions to help the 10 to 15 percent of the American public that is unlucky enough that they don't have health insurance. And by the way, some of you who have health insurance right now, at some point you may lose your health insurance, and if you've got a preexisting condition, this structure will make sure that you are not left vulnerable.
But it's still a big undertaking. And what we're doing is making sure that every single day, we are constantly trying to hit our marks so that it will be in place.
And the last point I'll make: Even if we do everything perfectly, there will still be glitches and bumps, and there will be stories that can be written that say, oh, look, this thing is not working the way it's supposed to and this happened and that happened. And that's pretty much true of every government program that's ever been set up. But if we stay with it and we understand what our long-term objective is, which is making sure that in a country as wealthy as ours, nobody should go bankrupt if they get sick and that we would rather have people getting regular checkups than going to the emergency room because they don't have health care. If we keep that in mind, then we're going to be able to drive down costs, we're going to be able to improve efficiencies in the system, we're going to be able to see people benefit from better health care. And that will save the country money as a whole over the long term.
Q. Do you believe, without the cooperation of a handful of Governors, particularly large States like Florida and Texas, that you can fully implement this?
The President. I think it's harder. There's no doubt about it.
Q. But can you do it without them?
The President. We will implement it. There will be—we have a backup Federal exchange. If States aren't cooperating, we set up a Federal exchange so that people can access that Federal exchange.
But yes, it puts more of a burden on us. And it's ironic, since all these folks say that they believe in empowering States, that they're going to end up having the Federal Government do something that we'd actually prefer States to do if they were properly cooperating.
Let's see how we're doing on time here. Last question, Antonieta Cadiz [El Mercurio]—where's Antonieta? There you are. Tell those big guys to get out of your way. [Laughter]
Immigration Reform/Mexico/President's Visit to Costa Rica
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. And two questions. There are concerns about how the immigration bill from the House , from the Gang of Eight—in the House, has complicated chances for immigration reform in the Senate. It seems to be a more conservative proposal. Is there room for a more conservative proposal than the one presented in the Senate? That's immigration.
And second, on Mexico, yesterday the Mexican Government said all contact with the U.S. law enforcement will now go through a single door, the Federal Interior Ministry. Is this change good for the U.S. relationship with Mexico? Do you think the level of security and cooperation can be maintained?
The President. On immigration reform, I've been impressed by the work that was done by the Gang of Eight in the Senate. The bill that they produced is not the bill that I would have written, there are elements of it that I would change, but I do think that it meets the basic criteria that I laid out from the start, which is: We've got to have more effective border security, although it should build on the great improvements that have been made on border security over the last 4 to 5 years. We should make sure that we are cracking down on employers that are gaming the system. We should make the legal immigration system work more effectively so that the waits are not as burdensome, the bureaucracy is not as complicated, so that we can continue to attract the best and the brightest from around the world to our shores in a legal fashion. And we want to make sure that we've got a pathway to citizenship that is tough, but allows people to earn over time their legal status here in this country.
And the Senate bill meets that—those criteria, in some cases not in the way that I would, but it meets those basic criteria. And I think it's a it's a testament to the Senators that were involved that they made some tough choices and made some tough compromises in order to hammer out that bill.
Now, I haven't seen what Members of the House are yet proposing. And maybe they think that they can answer some of those questions differently or better. And I think we've got to be open minded in seeing what they come up with. The bottom line, though, is, is that they've still got to meet those basic criteria: Is it making the border safer? Is it dealing with employers in how they work with the governments to make sure that people are not being taken advantage of or taking advantage of the system? Are we improving our legal immigration system? And are we creating a pathway for citizenship for the 11 million or so who are undocumented in this country?
And if they meet those criteria, but they're slightly different than the Senate bill, then I think that we should be able to come up with an appropriate compromise. If it doesn't meet those criteria, then I will not support such a bill. So we'll have to wait and see.
When it comes to Mexico, I'm very much looking forward to taking the trip down to Mexico to see the new President, Peña Nieto. I had a chance to meet him here, but this will be the first, more extensive consultations, and it will be an opportunity for his Ministers, my Cabinet members who are participating, to really hammer out some of these issues.
A lot of the focus is going to be on economics. We've spent so much time on security issues between the United States and Mexico that sometimes, I think we forget this is a massive trading partner responsible for huge amounts of commerce and huge numbers of jobs on both sides of the border. We want to see how we can deepen that, how we can improve that and maintain that economic dialogue over a long period of time.
That doesn't mean that we're not going to be talking about security. I think that in my first conversation with the President, he indicated to me that he very much continues to be concerned about how we can work together to deal with transnational drug cartels. We've made great strides in the coordination and cooperation between our two Governments over the last several years. But my suspicion is, is that things can be improved.
And some of the issues that he's talking about really had to do with refinements and improvements in terms of how Mexican authorities work with each other, how they coordinate more effectively, and it has less to do with how they're dealing with us, per se. So I'm not going to yet judge how this will alter the relationship between the United States and Mexico until I've heard directly from them to see what exactly are they trying to accomplish.
But overall, what I can say is that my impression is, is that the new President is serious about reform. He's already made some tough decisions. I think he's going to make more that will improve the economy and security of Mexican citizens, and that will improve the bilateral relationship as well.
And I don't want to leave out that we're also going to be talking to, during my visit to Costa Rica, Presidents of Central American countries, many of whom are struggling with both economic issues and security issues, but are important partners for us, because I think that the vision here is that we want to make sure that our hemisphere is more effectively integrated to improve the economy and security of all people. That's good for the United States. That will enhance our economy. That can improve our energy independence.
There are a whole range of opportunities, and that's going to be the purpose of this trip. And I'm sure that those of you who will have the chance to travel with me, we'll have a chance to discuss this further.
All right? Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, guys.
National Basketball Association Player Jason Collins/Civil Rights
Q. Jason Collins? Do you want to say anything about it?
The President. Yes. I'll say something about Jason Collins. I had a chance to talk to him yesterday. He seems like a terrific young man. And I told him I couldn't be prouder of him.
One of the extraordinary measures of progress that we've seen in this country has been the recognition that the LGBT community deserves full equality, not just partial equality, not just tolerance, but a recognition that they're fully a part of the American family.
And given the importance of sports in our society, for an individual who has excelled at the highest levels in one of the major sports to go ahead and say, this is who I am, I'm proud of it, I'm still a great competitor, I'm still 7 foot tall and can bang with Shaq—[Laughter]—and deliver a hard foul, and for, I think, a lot of young people out there who are gay or lesbian who are struggling with these issues, to see a role model like that who is unafraid, I think it's a great thing.
And I think Americans should be proud that this is just one more step in this ongoing recognition that we treat everybody fairly and everybody is part of a family, and we judge people on the basis of their character and their performance and not their sexual orientation. So I'm very proud of him.
All right?"
"May 02, 2013","The President's News Conference With President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico in Mexico City, Mexico",Barack Obama,"Barack Obama, The President's News Conference With President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico in Mexico City, Mexico Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/304153",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-enrique-pena-nieto-mexico-mexico-city-mexico,"President Peña Nieto. Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon, everyone. First and foremost, after the bilateral meeting, I would like to extend the warmest welcome to President Barack Obama, his team joining him. Once again, we would like to welcome all of you with open arms, and we hope you feel at home.
We appreciate your will to have upon this meeting a relation built on mutual respect, collaboration for the benefit of our peoples.
Before we cover the areas that we have shared during our bilateral meeting, on behalf of the Mexican people, I would like to reiterate our solidarity for the regretful acts that were committed in your country: in Boston and in West, in Texas. Unfortunately, it took the lives of American citizens.
If you allow me, I would like to share with the audience and the members of the media the areas that we have addressed with President Obama during the meeting that we just have had.
First of all, we have reached an agreement that the relation between Mexico and the United States should be broad in terms of the areas that it covers. It should open up opportunity and collaboration spaces in different arenas, with a very clear purpose in mind to make North American region a more productive and competitive region that will, in result, trigger the enormous potential that our peoples have, that our nations have. And we're well aware of the fact that we can take stock of our bilateral relation. Within the framework of the agreements made, we have reached a new level of understanding, as our two new administrations that begin roughly at the same time: the second term of President Obama and my administration.
Among the items that we covered, I can speak for how relevant trade and commerce is in the Mexico-U.S. relation. We have dimension of all the achievements made upon the free trade agreement and the benefits that our economies have received from it. The exports made from the U.S. to its top trade partners, Mexico and Canada, this represents one-third, one out of each three products that are exported from the U.S. And only the relation with Mexico is higher than the one the U.S. has with European countries like the U.K., France, the Netherlands all together. Or the exports sent to China and Japan together doesn't reach the level that the U.S. has with Mexico.
I must stand out that the integration of our economies in the last years has shown to be relevant, and the content of exports sent out from Mexico have 40 percent of U.S. input. Therefore, I can conclude that the more growth Mexico shows and the more capacity to export, the more benefit the U.S. gets. Jobs are created in Mexico; therefore, jobs are created in the United States.
Therefore, one of the first agreements that we have made was to create a high-level dialogue that, within its framework, will foster trade and commerce with the United States. This means that for the first time—and probably, this is unprecedented—we will have the Mexican economic cabinet with their counterparts from various Government agencies from the United States, as well high-ranking officials. And we've heard from the President that in this group, the Vice President of the United States will participate in order to set a dialogue that will result in arrangements in terms of how the government can support all the efforts made by the private sector in order to have a stronger economic integration.
For this purpose, we have agreed that during the fall of this year, this high-level group will meet for the first time with the attendance of high-ranking officials to start working in the area of the economy.
We have also agreed to endeavor joint actions to have a safer border. Within the framework of the agreement made, we will have a 21st-century border that was about to be defined the work and action agenda that our teams have already set up. And now, through this agenda, we will have safer borders that will enable and expedite the transit of people and goods that every day cross our borders.
We have also agreed to create a binational group in order to find joint actions and joint mechanisms to support entrepreneurs in both of our countries, and by this, we will boost SMEs in our countries. We believe that this mechanism will serve as an enabler, and it will see further development for these small and medium-size companies that are present in both of our countries. And we hope that all the actions in a very near future will make the SMEs in the future becoming large enterprises. And this action will favor specifically young entrepreneurs in both of our countries.
Thirdly, we have agreed to boost our economy and our potential; we have agreed to create a bilateral forum on higher education, innovation, and research. Two government agencies will work together—CONACYT and the National Science Foundation from the U.S.—and presidents from Mexico and U.S. universities will be part of this group. And by this, more exchanges will happen between Mexico and the U.S., and students coming from the U.S. to Mexico.
We have agreed that higher education serves as a platform to boost the economic potential that we have in our nations. In order to compete with the world, specifically with highly developed countries where science and technology have been the target of their efforts and investment, it is fundamental that we have well-prepared youngsters with the skills necessary to give our economic development a greater strength and a greater capacity.
In a different arena, we have addressed security. We have both recognized the level of cooperation that the U.S. has shown towards the Mexican Government. And the new strategy in the area of security in our country has a very clear purpose, and that is to fight organized crime in all of its forms, be it drug dealing, kidnaping for ransom, extortion, or any crime perpetrated. We are not going to renounce to that responsibility as a Government and my administration. We're going to face crime in all of its forms.
But in our new strategy, we have emphasized the fact that we will reduce violence. Unfortunately, it affects coexistence between Mexicans. To fight organized crime and reduce violence are not objectives that contradict each other. There is no clash between these two goals. These are two goals that fall within the framework of one same strategy. And President Obama's administration has expressed his will, as we know, to cooperate on the basis of mutual respect, to be more efficient in our security strategy that we are implementing in Mexico.
I have shared with President Obama, as well, what Mexico has done during the first months of my administration. I have shared with President Obama that Mexico has reached maturity in terms of its democracy. All political forces in the country have reached political maturity, have shown to be civil, and have managed to show respect to each other and also towards the Government of Mexico. Together, we have managed to set up a working agenda that, in result, will advance the reforms that will transform this structure that Mexico needs to boost its development. I have shared with President Obama the fact that we recognize all political voices in Mexico.
Finally, I would like to share with all of you that we fully agree that our nations, that our peoples must move from being neighbors to being part of a community. We are already part of a trade integration process. We have reached high levels of development. But still, there is potential to make of our nations, through a collaboration and integration of North America, we can make a more productive and a more competitive region.
I would like to conclude by quoting the words of former President Kennedy shared during his visit to Palacio Nacional 51 years ago, under former President Adolfo López Mateos. We have shared this quote with President Obama, but I would like to share it with all of you.
President Kennedy said to President López Mateos, ""Geography has made us neighbors; tradition has made us friends."" Let us not allow a gap fall between what nature has united. And that is why we vow so that this understanding, this dialogue climate that we have set up, in result, will give us more growth, more development, and more opportunities for our peoples.
Once again, allow me to reiterate, President Obama—and this goes for your delegation as well—you are warmly welcomed to Mexico, and I hope that your stay is fruitful and you enjoy your stay in Mexico as well.
Thank you very much.
President Obama. Muchas gracias, Señor Presidente, to President Peña Nieto for your kind words and your extraordinary hospitality. As President-elect, you were the first leader I welcomed to the White House after our election. It was a sign of our extraordinarily close relationship between our two countries.
During Enrique's visit, I noted that he spent time as a student in the United States in one of our most beautiful States, the State of Maine. I must say, though: Maine is very cold, and so when I come here on a beautiful spring day here in this beautiful city, I understand why you came back home.
I want to thank you for your hospitality. I look forward to joining you and the First Lady, la Señora Rivera, this evening. And I want to thank all the people of Mexico for such a warm welcome. It's always a pleasure to visit.
As President Peña Nieto discussed, between our two countries, we're some 430 million people. Ten million—tens of millions of Mexican Americans enrich our national life in the United States. Well over 1 million Americans live here in Mexico. Every year, millions of tourists—most of them from the United States—visit this magnificent country. Every day, millions of workers in our countries earn a living from the jobs that are made possible by our trade, and more than 1 million people cross our shared border: businesspeople, students, educators, scientists, researchers, collaborating in every sphere of human endeavor.
In other words, Mexico and the United States have one of the largest, most dynamic relationships of any two countries on Earth. And yet we don't always hear about all aspects of these extraordinary ties because too often two issues get attention: security or immigration.
Obviously, these are serious challenges, and President Peña Nieto and I discussed them in depth today. I agreed to continue our close cooperation on security, even as the nature of that cooperation will evolve. As I told the President, it is obviously up to the Mexican people to determine their security structures and how it engages with other nations, including the United States. But the main point I made to the President is that we support Mexican Government's focus on reducing violence, and we look forward to continuing our good cooperation in any way that the Mexican Government deems appropriate.
I also reaffirmed our determination in the United States to meet our responsibilities: to reduce the demand for illegal drugs and to combat the southbound flow of illegal guns and cash that help to fuel violence.
Again, I want to pay tribute to the people of Mexico, who have made extraordinary sacrifices for their security and display great courage and resolve every day.
But even as we continue to deal with these urgent challenges, we can't lose sight of the larger relationship between our peoples, including the promise of Mexico's economic progress. I believe we've got a historic opportunity to foster even more cooperation, more trade, more jobs on both sides of the border, and that's the focus of my visit.
The United States and Mexico have one of the largest economic relationships in the world. Our annual trade has now surpassed $500 billion, more than $1 billion every day. We are your largest customer, buying the vast majority of Mexican exports. Mexico is the second largest market for U.S. exports. So every day, our companies and our workers, with their integrated supply chains, are building products together. And this is the strong foundation that we can build on.
I want to commend President Peña Nieto and the Mexican people for the ambitious reforms that you've embarked on to make your economy more competitive, to make your institutions more effective. And I know it's hard, but it's also necessary.
Ultimately, only Mexicans can decide how Mexico reforms. But let me repeat what I told to the President: As Mexico works to become more competitive, you've got a strong partner in the United States, because our success is shared. When one of us prospers, both of us prosper. And that's the context for the progress that we made today.
As President mentioned, we're, first of all, creating a high-level dialogue to broaden and deepen our economic relationship. On our side, it will be led by members of my Cabinet. Vice President Biden will participate as well. Together with Mexico, we'll focus on increasing the connections between our businesses and workers, promoting innovation and entrepreneurship and making our economies even more competitive.
To that end, we also reaffirmed our goal of concluding negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership this year. This would be another major step in integrating our two economies and positioning us to compete in the fastest growing markets in the world, those in the Asia-Pacific region. We want to be able to sell more goods from Mexico and the United States. And if we're partnering together, we can do even better.
We agreed to continue to make our shared border even more efficient with new infrastructure and new technologies so it's even faster and cheaper to trade and do business together. We reaffirmed our commitment to the clean energy partnerships that allow our two countries to enhance our energy security and combat climate change. And I'm very pleased that we've agreed to expand collaborations and exchanges between our students, our schools, and our universities.
Just as Enrique once studied in our country, we want more Mexicans studying in the United States, and we want more American students studying here in Mexico. And we're going to focus on science and technology and engineering and math to help our young people, including our daughters, succeed in this global economy.
And finally, I updated the President on our efforts in the United States to pass commonsense, comprehensive immigration reform that lives up to our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants, including generations of Mexican Americans.
As we do, I think it's important for everybody to remember that our shared border is more secure than it's been in years. Illegal immigration attempts into the United States are near their lowest level in decades, and legal immigration continues to make both of our countries stronger and more prosperous and more competitive.
And this, in part, reflects the economic progress and greater opportunities here in Mexico. I think this progress should help inform the debate in the United States. And I'm optimistic that we're finally going to get comprehensive immigration reform passed.
I'll have much more to say about this and some other issues in my speech tomorrow. But for now, I want to express my gratitude to the President for his hospitality and also for your leadership. And given the progress that we're seeing here in Mexico, I see so many opportunities to continue to deepen the extraordinary friendship and common bond that we share between our two great nations and our two great peoples. I know we will do that.
So thank you very much. Muchas gracias.
Moderator. Now we will have a round of four questions. Marú Rojas from Radio Formula.
Border Security/Mexico-U.S. Relations
Q. To the President of Mexico, we welcome gladly that the agenda is broadened. There is no speculation on the priority topics to be included in your agendas. Could you clarify if this high-level group, please, as you have pointed out, will overcome efficiently the results of a fight that these two nations had on the issue of security? It seems to be that trade is now a priority; no longer security is.
And for President Obama, given your expertise during this second administration, what is your take on Enrique Peña Nieto's new administration in terms of reforms? You have acknowledged the reforms made so far. Is the U.S. Government seeing this reform as on the part of the administration or a pact? Thank you.
President Peña Nieto. Thank you very much. We have relaunched our relationship, and we have agreed on the climate within which we're going to work on. We have defined our priorities. We don't want to make this relationship targeted on one single issue. We want to broaden our relation to include different areas, and we want to specially emphasize our relation on the trade relation potential between Mexico and the U.S.
We're also going to cover other areas. Of course, public safety is included, and we have shared our view on that topic to work towards reducing violence by combating efficiently organized crime.
And I must insist, we have reviewed the long list of potential and opportunities that we have identified in the economic relation between the U.S. and Mexico in the area of trade and commerce. President Obama has already put it for the U.S. We represent a market that receives their exports. We're the second export destination, and in our case, the United States ranks first. We need to identify the areas where we can supplement each other's production of goods and exports and goods from Mexico to the world, because these products have a high content of U.S. input.
As I have stated, this means that if Mexico does well in its productive capabilities—that is to say, by creating more labor and its capability to export more products—the U.S. will benefit, and vice versa.
That is why this high-level meeting foresees the participation of officials that are a part of my cabinet. The U.S. has not a tradition of having cabinets like the ones we have, but President Obama has decided that high-ranking officials from different Government agencies will participate, including the U.S. Vice President. They will be part of this high-level group that will define specific actions. That—what has been done so far in the private sector complementarity has happened. And we have seen a good flow of trade between our countries. There is no doubt that even when it has reached a certain level, we can push it further. We can extend its capabilities if both of our governments identify the right mechanisms, the right formula to boost economic integration. And that is precisely the agreement that we have reached today.
President Obama. Well, first of all, just on the security issue, I think it's natural that a new administration here in Mexico is looking carefully at how it's going to approach what has obviously been a serious problem. And we are very much looking forward to cooperating in any ways that we can to battle organized crime, as President Peña Nieto stated.
And we anticipate that there's going to be strong cooperation, that on our side of the border, we have continued work to do to reduce demand and to try to stem the flow of guns and cash from north to south.
So this is a partnership that will continue. I think that President Peña Nieto and his team are organizing a vision about how they can most efficiently and effectively address these issues. And we will interact with them in ways that are appropriate, respecting that ultimately, Mexico has to deal with its problems internally and we have to deal with ours as well.
With respect to the President's agenda, we had a wonderful relationship with President Calderón and the previous administration. The bonds between our two countries go beyond party. If a Republican President replaces me, there's still going to be great bonds between Mexico and the United States because not just the geography, but friendship and our interactions.
But what I have been impressed with is the President's boldness in his reform agenda. He's tackling big issues. And that's what the times demand. We live in a world that is changing rapidly, and in both the United States and in Mexico we can't be caught flatfooted as the world advances.
We have to make sure that our young people are the best educated in the world. And that means that some of the old ways of educating our kids may not work. We have to make sure that we're staying at the forefront of science and technology. And that means we've got to make sure that we're investing in those areas appropriately. We have to make certain that our economies are competitive around the world and that when it comes to energy, that we're addressing issues like climate change, but also making sure that it's done in a way that's creating jobs and businesses on both sides of the border.
And so what I very much appreciate is the President's willingness to take on hard issues, because sometimes, I think there's a temptation, once somebody is elected, to just stay elected, as opposed to trying to make sure that we use our time as well as we can to bring about the kinds of changes will help move the country forward.
Syria/Immigration Reform
White House Press Secretary James F. ""Jay"" Carney. From the U.S. press, Julie Pace of the Associated Press.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Administration officials, including Secretary Hagel, say that the U.S. is now more seriously considering sending weapons to the Syrian rebels. How has your thinking on the effectiveness of such a step evolved as the violence in Syria has continued? And do you now see lethal aid as the best option available for a U.S. escalation in Syria?
I also had a question on immigration that I was hoping you both could address. Senator Rubio said today that on the immigration bill being considered on Capitol Hill may not pass the Senate unless the border security measures are strengthened. Are you concerned that an effort to bolster those border security triggers may make a pathway to citizenship almost impossible for many people already in the U.S. illegally, including many Mexicans?
President Obama. Well, first of all, on Syria, what Secretary Hagel said today is what I've been saying now for months, which is we are continually evaluating the situation on the ground, working with our international partners to find the best way to move a political transition that has Asad leaving, stabilizes the country, ends the killing, and allows the Syrian people to determine their own destiny. And we've made enormous investments, not just in humanitarian aid, but also in helping the opposition organize itself and make sure that it has a consistent vision about how it's operating.
And as we've seen evidence of further bloodshed, potential use of chemical weapons inside of Syria, what I've said is, is that we're going to look at all options. And we know that there are countries that are currently providing lethal aid to the opposition. We also know that the Asad regime is getting not just lethal aid, but also training and support from countries outside of Syria. And we want to evaluate and make sure that every step that we take advances the day when Asad is gone and you have people inside of Syria who are able to determine their own destiny rather than engage in a long, bloody sectarian war.
And we'll continue to evaluate that every step of the way. But as I mentioned at my press conference back in DC, we want to make sure that we look before we leap and that what we're doing is actually helpful to the situation as opposed to making it more deadly or more complex.
With respect toimmigration reform, I expressed to President Peña Nieto that I'm optimistic about us getting this done, because it's the right thing to do. We've seen leaders from both parties indicate that now is the time to get comprehensive immigration reform done. And part of what we discussed is the importance of getting it done precisely because we do so much business between our two countries; that for us to constantly bog down on these border issues and debates instead of moving forward with a 21st-century border that's maintaining security and that is making sure that legal immigration and legal trade and commerce is facilitated, but at the same time, ensures that we're not seeing a lot of illegal traffic and allows us to continue to be a nation of immigrants that has contributed so much to the wealth and prosperity of our Nation—if we're going to get that done, now is the time to do it.
And the bill that Senator Rubio and others put forward, I think, is a great place to start. It doesn't contain everything I want, and I suspect that the final legislation will not contain everything I want. It won't contain everything that Republican leaders want either. But if we can get a basic framework that secures our border, building on the extraordinary success we've already had and the cooperation we've had with the Mexican Government; that cracks down on employers who are not taking the law seriously; that streamlines and enhances our legal immigration system, because the problems with our legal immigration system often force people into the illegal immigration system; and provides a pathway to citizenship for those who are currently living in the shadows inside of the United States—if it has those elements, then we should be able to build on that. And we can have arguments about other elements of this as we go further, but that's the core of what we need.
And frankly, we've put enormous resources into border security. Don't take my word for it: You had folks like Senator McCain and Senator Graham come down to the border and see the progress that's been made. There are areas where there's still more work to be done. Some of it, by the way, is not simply securing the United States from illegal traffic, some of it is also improving the infrastructure, which we talked about, for commerce to be able to come in smoothly, which creates jobs and helps our businesses both in the United States and in Mexico.
But what I'm not going to do is to go along with something where we're looking for an excuse not to do it as opposed to a way to do it. And I think we can. I think if all sides operate in good faith, that can be accomplished.
President Peña Nieto. On that matter, allow me to note that the Mexican Government acknowledges the efforts made by—the leadership made by President Barack Obama and your Congress to eventually pass the immigration bill. Mexico understands that this is a domestic affair for the U.S., and we wish you the best in this push that you're giving to immigration.
That is what I have to say in terms of the reform. Francisco Reséndiz from El Universal journal.
International Trade
Q. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Mr. President, good afternoon. I would like to ask you both, specifically, what would be the most important outcome of President Obama's visit to Mexico? On the one hand, that is my question. And I would like to ask you as well: Have you considered the possibility to scale up the Mexico-U.S. relation and to integrate the region further? This could lead to a binational strategy in terms of fighting organized crime transnationally. Thank you very much for your answers.
President Peña Nieto. Thank you very much. In order to conclude this meeting, I would like to say that we have revitalized our relation between two governments that have two new administrations. This is President Obama's second term and this new administration for Mexico. The climate within which we are strengthening our relation is based on cordiality. Our relation is based on respect; it's based on cooperation and collaboration in all of those areas that we share a common interest.
We are not going to target this relation in one specific area. We want to address multiple issues. We want to work on an agenda that would allow us to identify all the potential areas that could help us advance our agenda.
We have emphasized trade and commerce during this visit because we have made a thorough analysis of the U.S. and Mexico trade relations. We have analyzed trade flows and how our economies supplement each other. And there is potential if we truly want to become in a more productive and more competitive North American region, well, that's what we need to do first to compete with other regions in the world.
Those are the highlights and specifically the agreements made to create a high-level dialogue, the bilateral forum to advance academic exchanges and to work towards science and innovation in both of our countries.
Also, we will have a binational dialogue to foster SMEs. Undoubtedly, these are mechanisms that, in result, will help us project further the economic and trade relation that Mexico has with the United States.
And certainly, I must insist, let me say it very clearly, the cooperation that we already have with the U.S. in the area of security, let me tell you that under this new strategy, we're going to order things up. We're going to make it institutional. The channels will be very clear. We're going to use one single channel in order to make—to be more efficient, to attain better results.
And we have reached a very good understanding with the U.S. Government. They know why we're emphasizing violence reduction in our strategy. President Obama has expressed his respect to the strategy that the Mexico's Government will define in the area of security, and they have shown to be willing to cooperate with us in order to reach the goals that we have set up to have a peaceful Mexico where there is security.
President Obama. Well, I think President Peña Nieto summarized it well. Let me give you one specific example, and that is the work that our countries are doing together around the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the TPP.
Our largest trading partner is Canada. Our second largest trading partner is Mexico. So North America has already become far more integrated economically than it was 10 years ago or 20 years ago. There are suppliers from Mexico w","ho sell to U.S. companies that in turn sell back into Mexico or sell to Canada or sell around the world. There are jobs that are created in Mexico, jobs that are created in the United States. All of our economies have grown as a consequence of the work that's taking place together.
But as I said, the world is changing. So the fastest growing part of the world is the Asia-Pacific region, huge markets. And by us working closely together to upgrade and revamp our trade relationship, we're also in a position to project outward and start selling more goods and services around the world. And that means more jobs and more businesses that are successful in Mexico and in the United States.
Some of that is going to be bilateral. So finding ways that we can reduce trade frictions, improving our transportation and our infrastructure cross-border, how we can improve our clean energy cooperation. Already, you have a situation in which energy that is created in power plants in California sometimes is sold during nonpeak times into Mexico. And then when it's peak times in California, then it's sold back into California, which makes it more efficient on both sides of the border, and that reduces the cost for consumers on both sides. Well, those are the kinds of very specific areas that we can continue to refine and improve on. And that's what this high-level economic dialogue will accomplish.
But even as we're improving our bilateral negotiations, what it also allows us to do, then, is to say we're aligned in projecting both to the Pacific and to the Atlantic in saying, let's make sure that we're taking advantage of all the economic opportunities that are taking place around the world.
When the United States prospers, Mexico does well. And when Mexico does well, the United States does well. And that I think is the main message of my visit here today. That's what I want to make sure we're focused on, because certainly in the United States—and I know here in Mexico as well—when the economy is growing, when people have opportunity, then a lot of our other problems are solved, or at least we have the resources to solve them. And so that is something that we really want to make sure that we're focused on during the rest of my term in office and during President Peña Nieto's term in office.
Family Planning and Access to Contraception/Gun Control
Mr. Carney. Next from the U.S. press, Kathleen Hennessey of the Los Angeles Times.
Q. Thank to you both. Mr. President, I wanted to ask about a domestic issue if I could, the FDA rule on the morning-after pill that came out this week that prohibits girls under 15 from buying the ""morning after"" pill without a prescription. I'm wondering if—what your opinion on the rule is, and if it resolves some of the concerns you expressed last year when you talked about your role as a father and how that's influenced your thinking on this, and if you believe that there's scientific evidence to justify the 15-year-old cutoff.
And for President Peña Nieto, I wanted to ask you about gun control. The President's most recent attempt to pass new legislation on guns just failed in the Senate. You've spoken out on this before. I'm wondering if you talked to him about this in your meeting and if you would urge him—have urged him—to try again, or if there's more that you think the White House could do administratively, without approval from Congress, to resolve the issue. Thank you.
President Obama. Well, first of all, on the FDA issue, let me make a couple points clear. Number one, this is a decision made by the FDA and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. It's not my decision to make.
The first time around, where there were no age restrictions, Secretary Sebelius expressed concerns, and I supported those concerns. And I gave voice to them in the press room back in DC.
I—the rule that's been put forward by the FDA, Secretary Sebelius has reviewed. She's comfortable with. I'm comfortable with it.
The second point I want to make is, I'm very supportive of contraception because I think it's very important that women have control over their health care choices and when they are starting a family. That's their decision to make. And so we want to make sure that they have access to contraception. As you know we had a little bit of a fuss around what we're doing with the Affordable Care Act, but I very much think that's the right thing to do.
So the current ruling is actually—you phrased it as prohibiting. I think you could phrase it as, they're now allowing these contraceptions to be—contraceptives to be sold over the counter for 15-year-olds and older. It has not resolved the question of girls younger than 15.
There was a court case that came up that is being appealed by the Justice Department. That's a Justice Department decision. My understanding is, part of it has to do with the precedent and the way in which the judge handled that case. And my suspicion is, is that the FDA may now be called upon to make further decisions about whether there's sufficient scientific evidence for girls younger than 15.
That's the FDA's decision to make. That's Secretary Sebelius's decision to review. But I'm very comfortable with the decision they've made right now based on solid scientific evidence for girls 15 and older.
I know you didn't direct the question to me, though I do want to editorialize just for a second about gun control. As I think all your Mexican counterparts understand and as I talked about with President Peña Nieto, we recognize we've got obligations when it comes to guns that are oftentimes being shipped down south and contributing to violence here in Mexico.
But frankly, what I'm most moved by are the victims of gun violence not just in Mexico, but back home, like the parents in Newtown. And I said the day that the legislation that had been proposed by Senators Manchin and Toomey in the Senate, the day that that failed to get 60 votes, that that was not the end, this was the beginning.
The last time we had major gun legislation it took six, seven, eight tries to get passed. Things happen somewhat slowly in Washington. But this is just the first round. And when you've got 90 percent of the American people supporting the initiatives that we put forward around background checks and making sure that drug traffickers, for example, can't just send in somebody with a clean record to purchase guns on their behalf with no way of tracking or stopping that. When you have commonsense legislation like that that the overwhelming majority of Americans, including gun owners, those of us who strongly support the Second Amendment, all of us supporting, I believe that eventually, we're going to get that done. And I'm going to keep on trying.
So I didn't mean to horn in on President Peña Nieto's response, but I just want to be clear that we're going to keep at this. One thing I am is persistent.
President Peña Nieto. In that regard, I believe that we have an agreement with President Obama's words. And what Mexico would like to see happening in the U.S., that is to control better the sales of weapons. And we cannot ignore the efforts made by President Obama's administration in order to approve the better control of weapons. If Mexico could add itself up to this important sector of the U.S. population—90 percent in favor of gun control—we would do it. But this is a domestic issue in the United States.
In terms of the areas that we are working in collaboration, areas that we can address, is specifically the fact—to avoid the fact that weapons bought in the U.S. could be brought to Mexico. Regretfully, many lives of Mexicans have been lost due to that illegal smuggling of weapons bought in the United States have reached Mexican soil. We have made our commitment, and we're working on it to work together towards making our borders safer. We are fighting illegal smuggling of weapons.
Mexico vows towards the efforts made by your Government, and we'll keep on supporting you to have better gun control in your country. But we're not going to wait until that happens. We are working by using more intelligence information, and we are taking action to have safer borders so that we don't have weapons being smuggled into Mexico that regretfully end up hurting many Mexicans.
President Obama. Thank you very much, everybody.
President Peña Nieto. Muchas gracias.
President Obama. Muchas gracias."
"May 03, 2013","The President's News Conference With President Laura Chinchilla Miranda of Costa Rica in San Jose, Costa Rica",Barack Obama,"Barack Obama, The President's News Conference With President Laura Chinchilla Miranda of Costa Rica in San Jose, Costa Rica Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/304163",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-laura-chinchilla-miranda-costa-rica-san-jose,"President Chinchilla. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, dear friends. Dear friends, journalists—international journalists, and from American and SICA. Thank you very much. Thank you for being here with us this afternoon.
In the first place and before we get any deeper concerning the results of the meetings that we just had recently, in the first place, what I'd like to do is to reiterate our warmest welcome, on behalf of all the Costa Rican people, to President Barack Obama and his delegation. And also I would like to reiterate on behalf of all Costa Ricans the feelings that we feel towards the United States of America.
And I also wanted to thank you very much for the way so cordial and constructive in which we have been able to develop this afternoon's issues, Mr. President, because I think that we have had very successful conversations in the bilateral meeting. It was my pleasure to report that precisely thanks to this open process of conversations that we have had, it is that we can explore new horizons, always trying to strengthen these all traditions based on the defense of values—the essential values—that have characterized the relationship between the United States and Costa Rica.
Particularly speaking, I'm talking about values of peace, freedom, democracy, respect to the human rights, and the human development. These are the values that we share. And these are the values on which we aspire to continue to develop the relationship between our two nations.
The conversations that we have had have been very useful, and I—and they have basically focused on six fundamental issues that reflect this rich diversity that characterizes the relationship between the two nations. We talked about institutional strengthening. We talked about the issues of international policy and the involvement, in particular, to which Costa Rica aspires in the international economic scenario.
We also talked about the use of fundamental instruments in the relationship of the two nations, like CAFTA, for instance. We talked about an issue that is important but it is not the one that defines our relationship, which is security. And we also talked about a fundamental issue that undoubtedly is going to define the progress and the joint development, not only between the United States of America and Costa Rica, but also between the United States and the Central American region, which is the area of energy.
And finally, of course, in our Costa Rican agenda, we included issues having to do with education, entrepreneurship, and innovation.
And please allow me to briefly walk you through these six issues so that you can get to know which has been the central element in each of them.
In the area of institutional strengthening, as you know, the Government of the United States is promoting what is called the alliance of open governments, that basically seeks to strengthen practices that are much more transparent and integral in everything that has to do with the exercise of institutions of public function.
Costa Rica has been an enthusiastic participant in this initiative. We have already proposed our action plan, and we aspire to continue to share initiatives, practices, exchanges of experiences in this issue.
In the area of involvement of Costa Rica in the economic global scenario and some of the issues of international policy, we have taken into account—we have used this session to talk about the involvement of the United States in the area of the fire weapons, and that together, they have been able to get the approval in the recent meeting of the United Nations.
Thank you very much, Mr. President, for having sponsored one of the treaties that is going to contribute the most to the peace in the world. In addition, I would like to recognize, in particular, the efforts of President Obama in the area—in his own country in order to raise awareness concerning the regulation of fire weapons.
Costa Rica, as some of you already know, is trying to play a more protagonistic role, especially in the area of global development. Costa Rica is a small economy, but it's a very open economy. It's a model of success. The inception of global value chains with more and more competitive, attracting—in the attraction based on high technology. And being a middle-income country, we are a country that is not seeking to get more aid. We basically want to have more opportunities to export what our people are producing.
As we have said in the past, we either export our products the people are able to produce or generate, or we're going to end up exporting our own people. And Costa Rica will continue to keep Costa Ricans in Costa Rica, with better opportunities of economic growth and with better opportunities of welfare.
And that is that the aspirations of Costa Rica include to be able to insert itself in the different fora where we will continue to widen the opportunities of trade, investment, and as a consequence, the opportunities to continue to generate employment and welfare in our country.
To this extent, we have talked to President Obama about two important fora where Costa Rica aspires to be present. One is the alliance—the Trans-Pacific alliance, the TPP, where the Government of the United States, and especially the Obama administration, is playing an important leadership to the effect of closing these negotiations. And we would hope that Costa Rica will continue to be the center of attention of the pioneer countries to be able to insert ourselves in the same initiative.
And the other important forum where we have given our best efforts is the forum for the cooperation and development. Costa Rica wants to be there precisely because we want to continue to adopt the best possible practices in matters of development of public policy.
In the area of the using of the CAFTA platform, as you know, this is going to be an issue—a regional issue, an issue of regional scope—but this becomes a bilateral issue to the extent that Costa Rica and the SICA—Costa Rica is one of the economies that has taken the best advantage of the opportunity provided by the economic—by the American market. We have become in the SICA framework the most important partner with the United States. Thanks to CAFTA, the countries in our region have increased by 70 percent the international trade. And what we basically seek is to be able to promote initiatives in the area of facilitation of trade.
Concerning the area of security, this, as I mentioned before, is an obligated issue. As you know, Costa Rica considered this a fundamental issue—has been considering this issue a fundamental one in the recent years. We have been able to do well facing common crime. We have been able to reduce the homicide rates significantly. We have been able to reduce the rates of violent crime, thanks to an integral approach in the area of prevention and sanction, as well as the issues having to do with control. But we also have to admit that the issue of organized crime continues to be important on the institution of stability and the integrity of our nations.
Thus, we talked about this issue. We had a conversation about it. We reiterated the importance of keeping the levels of cooperation that's—that we have had so far. But very particularly, we made the point on the efforts that are being displayed by the SICA countries as well as the United States Government with the purpose of approaching the issue of organized crime and drug smuggling from a much more integral approach, a much more diverse approach, and not only through the instruments of war. Thinking that we're going to be able to overcome this evil, a country like Costa Rica cannot go, of course, to war, but we have to take very seriously the strengthening of those mechanisms and those policies that would allow to prevent the entry of organized crime in our country.
And in that sense, we are celebrating the efforts that we might be able to continue on doing in the matter of prevention of the consumption, with the matter of more opportunities for the younger communities of our country on the subject of strengthening the state of law, of the judicial independence, of the free press that might be able to carry out the necessary investigations, and the accusations without having on them any effect or threat.
The fifth point of the agenda was a subject regarding the energy. As it is well known also for Costa Rica, the energy subject has been a value from the point of view of its sustainable development. Ninety percent of the energy that we consume comes from renewable sources. Nevertheless, Costa Rica, as well as the rest of Central America, have a very big challenge ahead of them from the point of view of the cost of this energy. If we do not solve this in the short, midterm, this will have a tremendous weight on the level of competivity of our region.
Therefore, we have explored with President Obama the possibilities of using the platform of the CAFTA—of the CAFTA platform so that in the future—and once the Government of the United States resolves some of the internal discussions that it might have—to be able to enjoy some preferences in regard to the import of the natural gas, natural liquefied gas, a source of energy to which the Government of President Obama have put a lot of emphasis on.
We have also commented about the efforts that we are developing here in Costa Rica with the purpose of promoting a group of new energies, especially the energies based on hydrogen, and the initiatives that have already been working on by the private enterprises—both North Americans and Costa Ricans—with the cooperation of the public sector of Costa Rica, to take them into consideration as part of the initiatives that he has promoted in the framework of the alliance of the Americas for the energy and for the climate change.
And I finish by talking about the subject of an interpartnership of innovation and of the education as essential elements of any agenda for the development. For Costa Rica, the education has been a constant in its historical development. And as I was telling President Obama, we were born as one of the poorest provinces of the colony, and we have become, little by little, in—the nation with great opportunities in the subject of economic development and of well-being for the people, and a fundamental factor, an essential factor has been precisely the education.
Much more—much before many other nations of the world, Costa Rica decreed the free and mandatory access to education. And now we dedicate 7 percent of our GDP to finance the public education, and we need, above all, to face the challenge of the reallocation of this education to the demands of the new economy to which we are aspiring to move our country.
In that sense, we have called upon the attention in regard to the possibility of using—with a greater intensity—the very beautiful program that has been characterized by the international policy of the United States, which is the Peace Corps, so that, through them, we might be able to improve even more. They have programs of bilingualism that Costa Rica, for 15 or 20 years, we have already been introducing in our public education.
We believe that through Peace Corps we can achieve training programs with our teachers, with our professors, our English professors, so that that English is a more proficient English, more competitive, with greater quality, and bound precisely to the aspirations of attracting investments and generation of employments—intelligent employments that we are working on.
Finally, also, we have called President Obama's attention to the fact that there is nothing more valuable, that there is nothing more important than anybody to get to know a society from the inside. I am a true example precisely of the benefits of the scholarship programs that the United States in the past have offered the Central American region. As a matter of fact, that is why we have made a summit so that we can continue on promoting those scholarship programs and intensify them so that the youth of the Central American region—and of course, of my country—can continue on also knowing or feeding of not only for knowledge of the best universities, of the quality of education of the United States, but also of the livelihood, the values that have characterized this great nation.
So thank you very much. Mr. President Obama.
President Obama. Buenas tardes. Thank you so much, President Chinchilla, for your kind words and for welcoming me here today. This is my first visit to Costa Rica. And even though it is a brief one, I can already tell the incredible spirit of the people, the natural beauty of the country. I understand that the official slogan for those who are thinking about visiting Costa Rica is ""un pais sin ingredientes artificiales."" So there's nothing artificial about Costa Rica. Everything is genuine. And that's certainly true about the friendship between our two countries.
And President Chinchilla has been so gracious in her hospitality. We are very grateful to her. I want to thank publicly the wonderful schoolchildren who sang for us. And I noticed that, Madam President, you and I didn't sing. We didn't trust our voices. But we certainly enjoyed the spirit that those children delivered.
In the United States, we are so grateful for the contributions that Costa Ricans make to our country every day. You welcome many Americans as tourists, ecotourists, and many others who have chosen to make Costa Rica a new home. This year we're also marking the 50th anniversary of the Peace Corps here, including President John F. Kennedy's visit to Costa Rica and his vision for partnerships that advance development and democracy in the Americas.
I had actually a chance during the bilateral meeting to see a photograph of President Kennedy at the same table that we were meeting at; it had been specially commissioned. And so it shows the longstanding ties between our two countries.
And I'm here because Costa Rica is a great partner not just regionally, but globally. Given Costa Rica's proud democratic traditions, we stand up together for democracy and justice and human rights in Central America and across the hemisphere. And I want to commend Costa Rica for your landmark law against the scourge of human trafficking. I'm proud to be here as you host World Press Freedom Day. So everybody from the American press corps, you should thank the people of Costa Rica for celebrating free speech and an independent press as essential pillars of our democracy.
Costa Rica shows the benefits of trade that is free and fair. Over the last few years, under the Central American Free Trade Agreement, our trade with Costa Rica has doubled, creating more jobs for people in both of our countries. Our partnerships are creating more opportunities for small businesses and entrepreneurs, including young people and women. As I told President Chinchilla, the United States will continue to be your partner as Costa Rica modernizes its economy so that you're attracting more investment and creating even more trade and more jobs.
Costa Rica, of course, has long been a leader in sustainable development that protects the environment. The President and I agreed to continue deepening our clean energy partnerships. For example, we're moving ahead with our regional efforts to ensure universal access to clean, affordable, sustainable electricity for the people of the Americas, including Costa Ricans. And this is also another way that we can meet our shared commitments to address climate change.
The President and I reaffirmed our determination to confront the growing security concerns that have affected many Costa Rican families and communities. And under the Central America Regional Security Initiative, the United States has committed nearly half a billion dollars to help Costa Rica and its neighbors in this fight. We're disrupting drug cartels and gangs. We're working to strengthen law enforcement and the judicial system. And we're addressing the underlying forces that fuel criminality with prevention programs for at-risk youth and with economic development that gives young people hope and opportunity.
Meanwhile, as I said in Mexico yesterday, the United States recognizes that we've got responsibilities; that much of the violence in the region is fueled by demand for illegal drugs, including in the United States. So we're going to keep on pursuing a comprehensive approach not only through law enforcement, but also through education and prevention and treatment that can reduce demand.
And finally, I updated the President on our efforts in the United States to pass comprehensive immigration reform. I know this is of great interest to the entire region, especially those with families in our country. And I'm optimistic that we're going to achieve reform that reflects our heritage as both a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants: men and women and children who need to be treated with full dignity and respect.
So, President Chinchilla, thank you so much for your partnership. Thank you and the people of Costa Rica for your hospitality.
I'm told there's a well-known quote here in Costa Rica: ""Where there is a Costa Rican, wherever it is, there's liberty."" And in the United States, we're thankful for the many Costa Ricans who contribute to our prosperity and our liberty. And we're grateful for Costa Rica's leadership in this region, as we'll see again when President Chinchilla hosts tonight's SICA meeting.
I'd note that our presence at tonight's meeting with the leaders of Central America and the Dominican Republic is a sign of the importance that the United States places on this region, as well as our commitment to being a steady and strong and reliable partner, because we believe that no matter where you live, the people of this region deserve security and opportunity and dignity.
So let me, again, say thank you, and in my best Tican: pura vida. Muchas gracias.
So I think we're going to go Costa Rican press first, and then I'll call on someone?
Drug Trafficking/Costa Rica
Q. Good afternoon. Welcome, President Obama. The policy of the United States for Central America has centered on drug smuggling and organized crime. Don't you think, for both Presidents, that the time has come to improve our relationships and go on to an agenda that apart from security, we have the subjects of the social aspects of education and health?
And my second question would be, if we're going to be supporting Costa Rica in subjects that were presented today in the organization of the SICA? So thank you, and welcome.
President Obama. Well, thank you very much. First of all, I completely agree with you, and I've tried to emphasize this throughout my trip: So much of the focus ends up being on security. And we understand that in the absence of security, it's very hard to develop. But we also have to recognize that problems like narcotrafficking arise in part when a country is vulnerable because of poverty, because of institutions that are not working for the people, because young people don't see a brighter future ahead.
And so what President Chinchilla and I spoke extensively about are initiatives like education, institution-building and capacity, trying to create greater economic opportunity, because the stronger the economies and the institutions for legitimate—for individuals who are seeking legitimate careers, the more those are there, then the less powerful these narcotrafficking operations are going to be.
And so not only are we interested in promoting trade and highlighting the already extensive trade that we're doing, but we also want to see how can we build on the successes to improve education even in our strategies to fight narcotrafficking. We, for example, helped to finance youth centers that can give young people a different vision for their futures. We consider that to be part of our overall effort. So it can't just be law enforcement. It also has to be human development, inclusive economic development. We've got to make sure that everybody feels opportunity.
Now, even if a country is doing well, the scourge of drugs and drug trafficking will still be there, and there still needs to be a strong law enforcement component. But we can do better than we're currently doing. And I know that President Chinchilla is taking a great interest here in Costa Rica around these human development issues.
As far as the issues that you mentioned around international organizations, as I indicated earlier, Costa Rica has shown itself to be a world leader and model around free trade, freedom of the press, democracy, respect for human rights, and that makes it an outstanding candidate for membership in the OECD, for example. And so we will expect that we'll continue to support Costa Rica in expanding its influence.
We enjoy a great partnership on, for example, regional human rights councils, as well as international human rights efforts. Costa Rica has been a real leader, and we appreciate that. And there's something very effective when large countries like the United States, smaller countries like Costa Rica share values. We come in together. And I think it's a great way to make the point that regardless of the country's size, regardless of the language that it speaks, the idea of certain universal rights that are observed for all people is important. And that's why we value this partnership so much.
President Chinchilla. Well, I was just going to add a couple of comments. And I think that it seems to me that I should start by thanking President Obama for his expressed support to the aspirations of Costa Rica for going in—for being a member of OECD. We know that there are tests that we have to comply with, and we know that we will be able to comply with them.
And also, to add something precisely—a comment in regard to the subject of narcotraffic, organized crime. We believe that there is not a single doubt that President Obama's administration—since his coming to Mexico and now his visit here in Central America—brings along an agenda that is trying to redefine those relationships based on a greater diversity.
As it was being said, our countries are more than just in security and violence and narcotraffic. That doesn't mean that it is not an important problem, but I would like to basically finally add the following. What some other countries have done for a few years now, with the purpose of trying to review some strategies that fall under the fight against the drugs, are based basically on the fact that some of the most immediate experiences we have seen in region are experiences that have had to call upon the extreme fight of the war on drugs. Costa Rica doesn't have an army. And since we don't want to found an army, we do not want to allow ourselves to come to war scenarios to face drug smuggling or organized crime.
Many times, the journalists ask me, how has Costa Rica done to face such a big threat when you don't have an army and precisely the countries next to you do have an army? But curiously enough, Costa Rica has demonstrated that we have been more effective and more successful in fighting against these threats precisely without having an army. And what am I going to with this? That what we're looking for, for a while now, is precisely the signals that the Obama administration is sending in the sense that effective policy for the fight against drugs and narcotraffic goes through the strengthening of the institutions, through prevention, through open society, a more transparent society, and through a citizenship that is much more aware of the problem.
It seems to me that advancing in that direction is precisely advancing in the correct direction.
President Obama. All right. Mark Felsenthal of Reuters. Mark.
Syria
Q. Thank you, Mr. President, Madam President. Mr. President, on Syria, you said yesterday that anything the United States does should make the situation better, not worse. How long are you prepared to wait to determine whether chemical weapons were used? What happens when you make your determination? And will you take your case to the United Nations? And have you ruled out putting U.S. troops on the ground in Syria?
President Obama. Well, first all, I emphasized yesterday, so let me reemphasize: We're not waiting. We're not standing by. We are currently the largest humanitarian donor to deal with the crisis in Syria. We are the largest contributor to—of nonlethal aid to the opposition. We've mobilized 80 countries to support the opposition. We are working to apply every pressure point that we can on Syria, working with our international partners.
And so we are actively engaged on a day-to-day basis to try to deal with this crisis and to restore a Syria that is respectful of the rights and aspirations of the Syrian people.
Now, as I've said before, if in fact we see strong evidence that we can present and that allows us to say that the Syrian military and the Syrian Government is using chemical weapons, then that is a game changer for us because, not only is there the prospect of widespread use of chemical weapons inside of Syria, but there's the possibility that it lands in the hands of organizations like Hizballah.
We have evidence that chemical weapons have been used. We don't know when, where, or how they were used. We are initiating on our own to investigate and get a better handle on the facts inside of Syria. We're also working with the international community and our partners to try to get a better handle on what's happening, and we've already gone to the United Nations to say we want a full-blown investigation inside of Syria. So far, for unsurprising reasons, President Asad has resisted.
We will stay on this. Now, if in fact there's the kind of systematic use of chemical weapons inside of Syria, we expect that we're going to get additional further evidence. And at that point, absolutely, we will present that to the international community, because I think this is, again, not just an American problem, this is a world problem. There are international rules and protocols and norms and ethics. And when it comes to using chemical weapons, the entire world should be concerned.
Now, in terms of what that means in terms of American action, keep in mind, we're already taking a whole range of actions. We're going to continue to take a whole range of actions. Separate and apart from the chemical weapon use, we got tens of thousands of people who are being killed inside of Syria, and we want to see that stopped for humanitarian reasons, but also for strategic reasons.
But in terms of any additional steps that we take, it's going to be based on, number one, the facts on the ground. Number two, it's going to be based on what's in the interest of the American people and our national security. And as President of the United States, I'm going to make those decisions based on the best evidence and after careful consultation, because when we rush into things, when we leap before we look, then not only do we pay a price, but oftentimes, we see unintended consequences on the ground. So it's important for us to do it right. And that's exactly what we're doing right now. Okay?
Drug Trafficking/Central America-U.S. Relations
Q. Last question on behalf of Costa Rica, from Alvaro—[inaudible]. Good afternoon, President Obama. Good afternoon, Madam President. President Obama, 10 years ago, you were about to begin—you were about to come to the Senate. Ten years have gone by and Central America has lost more than 130,000 lives caused by drugs traffic. This has been the sacrifice that the region has had because of this problem. What is the sacrifice that in your 4 years of government you pretend to undertake for this business that feeds on the profit that are produced especially by the consumption in your country? And if the United States also believes that the best option is to use warships to be able to surveil or keep a watch on the seas on the joint antinarcotic drug war?
And, Madam President, you have also expressed the values that the Government of Costa Rica has with the Government of the United States and your point of view with the President Obama, for example, on the subject of the international trade of weapons—of fire weapons. You say that President Obama said the time has come to recognize the rights for the bisexual couples of the United States. When is the time going to come for that in Costa Rica?
President Obama. Well, I think all of us recognize the pain and hardship that's been caused by drug trafficking and transnational drug cartels here in Central America. There's a cost obviously in the United States as well. I mean, it's not as if we don't have tragic drug problems throughout the United States. And when you look at poor communities inside of the United States, including communities in my hometown of Chicago, there are young people who are killed every day as part of the drug trade.
So this is not a situation where we do not feel the effects. There are common effects, and there are common responsibilities, which is why it's so important that we work on this on a regional basis.
Now, since I've been President, we've put our money where our mouth is. I've spent—or my administration has spent approximately $30 billion in reducing drug demand in the United States over the last several years. And we're actually seeing an impact in terms of reduced demand. But the United States is a big country and a big market, and so progress sometimes is slower than we'd like it to be.
There is obviously a role for law enforcement. I'm not interested in militarizing the struggle against drug trafficking. This is a law enforcement problem. And if we have effective law enforcement cooperation and coordination, and if we build up capacity for countries in Central America, then we can continue to make progress.
But the important thing that I've tried to emphasize throughout ","is that this is a common problem. This is one where we'll only solve it when we're working together. It has adverse effects in all of our countries. But—last point I'd make—I think it's very important to make sure that our bilateral relationship and the United States relationship with the region as a whole is not solely defined by this problem. Because when it is, we're missing all the opportunities that exist out there.
When I got off the plane, I was greeted by Dr. Chang, obviously a well-known scientist here, who worked at NASA and is working now on developing a whole new vision for clean energy, and he brought along four young people, these incredibly talented young people who are in their last year of high school here. And all four of them, thanks to some of the good work of our Ambassador and others, will be attending universities in the United States next fall.
And when you talk to those young people, there's incredible hope and incredible promise and incredible optimism. And I don't want every story to be about drug traffickers and nobody is writing a story about those four young people and what they represent in terms of the future of Costa Rica and the future of this region.
President Chinchilla. Every nation or every society has its own way of evolving towards the responses that have to be provided to the different demands of the social groups and of the different collectiveness that a country might have.
And when we analyze the evolution of the different nations, we see how some of them have advanced a little more acceleratedly and to subjects maybe of commitment towards the environment, in subjects, for example, for the control of some important aspects in the subject of protection of human life, like for example, the subject of the control of the fire weapons. And others are advancing furthermore in the recognition of certain rights, among them like the one that you have mentioned, the rights of the couples of the same sex.
The important thing, Alvaro, is that we cannot simply pass on or go beyond the rhythm or the evolution of the debates from one nation to another. Each one of the nations has its own rhythm. The important thing here, I believe—and what is of worth here—is that in Costa Rica the framework precisely of democracy that has characterized us, the debate has to be an open debate, a live debate, an active debate—a debate like the one that I have in qualifying it—that has to take place with the greatest of respect without putting a stigmas on the different positions that are proper to the debates that take place in a democracy.
And only the mature, ripened, seasoned debate will end up giving the result that will have to give—be given where it has to be given, which is inside the Parliament. So it seems to me that that is what is important, that the debate in Costa Rica is an open debate, a free debate that has to continue as a debate without restrictions.
That is why I have advocated and restated opportunities in my recent report to the nation that this is a dialogue that has been faced sometimes inconveniently on some positions that take sides. And as long as this is faced in this way, I think that the advancement is going to be very slow. I hope and I trust that the debate might really be a much more balanced, much more mature dialogue, without putting stigmas on it, and that this might eventually generate a decision in the Congress of the Republic.
President Obama. Okay, last question. Lisa [Lisa Lerer, Bloomberg].
Syria/Immigration Reform
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Senator Leahy is pushing for a bill on recognizing same-sex couples as part of the immigration bill. Are you concerned at all that that undermines the success of the package? And given that you made a point throughout your Presidency to make clear that you don't think LGTB Americans should be treated any differently, will you sign a bill that will do exactly that?
And for you, Madam President, is there any concern that the more—that by creating more stringent immigration standards could hamper the ability of Costa Ricans to emigrate to the U.S.? Thanks.
President Obama. Lisa, I hope you don't mind, before I answer your question, I want to get back to Mark because I realize there was one clause in your question—sometimes, you guys have a lot of clauses in your question—that I didn't specifically answer, and I didn't want anybody to extrapolate from that.
You asked about boots on the ground and whether we've ruled boots out on the ground in Syria. As a general rule, I don't rule things out as Commander in Chief, because circumstances change, and you want to make sure that I always have the full power of the United States at our disposal to meet American national security interests.
Having said that, I do not foresee a scenario in which boots on the ground in Syria, American boots on the ground in Syria would not only be good for America, but also would be good for Syria. And by the way, when I consult with leaders in the region who are very much interested in seeing President Asad leave office and stabilizing the situation in Syria, they agree with that assessment.
So just wanted to make sure that my omission there did not turn into a story.
To your question, Lisa, as I've indicated, I've got four broad criteria for immigration reform. I want to make sure that our border is secure and well regulated, in part so that we can get down to the business of smoothing trade and commerce across our borders and creating jobs in the United States, but also making sure that negative actors aren't able to penetrate the United States.
Number two, cracking down on semployers who are breaking the law. Number three, making sure we've got a legal immigration system that works better, smarter, and so that we can continue to attract the best and the brightest to the United States.
And by the way, when it comes to legal immigration, the issue here is not going to be stringency, per se, the issue is do we make the system more rational, more effective, better. If there are smart engineers and young people and scientists who—and students who are looking to emigrate to the United States from Costa Rica, then we want them to know that we're a nation of immigrants. But we want to make sure that the legal process is in place so that it's easier and simpler, but also more effective in managing the legal immigration process.
And finally, that we've got a pathway so that the n11 million or so undocumented workers inside the United States are able to pursue a tough, long, difficult, but fair path to legal status and citizenship.
So those are my broad-based criteria. Now, the provision that you've discussed that Senator Leahy has talked about is one that I support, and I've said in the past that the yLGBT community should be treated like everybody else. That's, to me, the essential, core principle behind our founding documents, the idea that we're all created equal and that we're equal before the law and it's applied fairly to everybody.
And so Senator Leahy may present this provision in committee. It may be presented on the floor. It will be one of many amendments and provisions that are presented, some of which I'll support, some of which I'll think are really bad ideas. And I think that the general principle for me is, are we advancing, are we improving the immigration system? Because ultimately, this is an immigration bill.
And we'll evaluate the end product. I think it's premature for me to start talking about what I will or will not do before I get a final product since the road is going to be long and bumpy before I finally see an actual bill on my desk. But I can tell you, I think that the provision is the right thing to do.
I can also tell you that I'm not going to get everything I want in this bill. Republicans are not going to get everything that they want in this bill. But if we keep focused on what our main aim is here, which is creating a smart, effective immigration system that allows us to be a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants, then we're going to be in a position to not only improve our economy and what's happening inside the United States, I—we're going to, I think, have a much stronger relationship with the region. And that's going to help enhance our economy and jobs and our growth over the long term.
And, last point I'll make, as is true with every bill, if there are things that end up being left out in this bill or things that I want to take out of a bill, but if it's meeting those core criteria around a comprehensive immigration bill that I'm looking for, then we go back at it, and we fix what's not there, and we continually improve what's been presented.
I think that this comprehensive immigration bill has the opportunity to do something historic that we have not done in decades. But I don't expect that, after we're finished with it, that people are going to say, there's not a single problem that we have with our immigration system, any more than is true after any piece of legislation that we pass. All right?
Well, thank you very much everybody. Muchas gracias.
President Chinchilla. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
"September 06, 2013","The President's News Conference in St. Petersburg, Russia",Barack Obama,"Barack Obama, The President's News Conference in St. Petersburg, Russia Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/305016",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-st-petersburg-russia,"The President. Good evening. Let me begin by thanking President Putin and the people of St. Petersburg and the people of Russia for hosting this G-20. This city has a long and storied history, including its historic resistance and extraordinary sacrifices during the Second World War. So I want to take this opportunity to salute the people of St. Petersburg and express our gratitude for their outstanding hospitality.
Now, this summit marks another milestone in the world's recovery from the financial crisis that erupted 5 years ago this month. Instead of the looming threat of another financial meltdown, we're focused for the first time in many years on building upon the gains that we've made. For the first time in 3 years, instead of an urgent discussion to address the European financial crisis, we see a Europe that has emerged from recession.
Moreover, the United States is a source of strength in the global economy. Our manufacturing sector is rebounding. New rules have strengthened our banks and reduced the chance of another crisis. We're reducing our addiction to foreign oil and producing more clean energy. And as we learned today, over the past 3½ years, our businesses have created 7½ million new jobs, a pace of more than 2 million jobs each year. We've put more people back to work, but we've also cleared away the rubble of crisis and laid the foundation for stronger and more durable economic growth.
We're also making progress in putting our fiscal house in order. Our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years. And as Congress takes up important decisions in the coming month, I'm going to keep making the case for the smart investments and fiscal responsibility that keeps our economy growing, creates jobs, and keeps the U.S. competitive. That includes making sure we don't risk a U.S. default over paying bills we've already racked up. I'm determined that the world has confidence in the full faith and credit of the United States.
Now, as the world's largest economy, our recovery is helping to drive global growth. And in the emerging markets in particular, there's a recognition that a strong U.S. economy is good for their economies too.
Yet we came to St. Petersburg mindful of the challenges that remain. As it emerges from recession, Europe has an opportunity to focus on boosting demand and reducing unemployment, as well as making some of the structural changes that can increase long-term growth. Growth in emerging economies has slowed, so we need to make sure that we are working with them in managing this process. And I'm pleased that over the past 2 days, we reached a consensus on how to proceed.
We agreed that our focus needs to be on creating jobs and growth that put people back to work. We agreed on ways to encourage the investments in infrastructure that keep economies competitive. Nations agreed to continue pursuing financial reforms and to address tax evasion and tax avoidance, which undermines budgets and unfairly shifts the tax burden to other taxpayers.
We're moving ahead with our development agenda, with a focus on issues like food security and combating corruption. And I'm very pleased that the G-20 nations agreed to make faster progress on phasing down certain greenhouse gases a priority. That's an important step in our fight against climate change.
During my trip, we also continued our efforts to advance two key trade initiatives: the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And I believe that if we continue to move forward on all the fronts that I've described, we can keep the global economy growing and keep creating jobs for our people.
Of course, even as we've focused on our shared prosperity—and although the primary task of the G-20 is to focus on our joint efforts to boost the global economy—we did also discuss a grave threat to our shared security, and that's the Syrian regime's use of chemical weapons. And what I've been emphasizing and will continue to stress is that the Asad regime's brazen use of chemical weapons isn't just a Syrian tragedy; It's a threat to global peace and security.
Syria's escalating use of chemical weapons threatens its neighbors: Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Israel. It threatens to further destabilize the Middle East. It increases the risk that these weapons will fall into the hands of terrorist groups. But more broadly, it threatens to unravel the international norm against chemical weapons embraced by 189 nations, and those nations represent 98 percent of the world's people.
Failing to respond to this breach of this international norm would send a signal to rogue nations, authoritarian regimes, and terrorist organizations that they can develop and use weapons of mass destruction and not pay a consequence. And that's not the world that we want to live in.
This is why nations around the world have condemned Syria for this attack and called for action. I've been encouraged by discussions with my fellow leaders this week; there is a growing recognition that the world cannot stand idly by. Here in St. Petersburg, leaders from Europe, Asia, and the Middle East have come together to say that the international norm against the use of chemical weapons must be upheld and that the Asad regime used these weapons on its own people and that, as a consequence, there needs to be a strong response.
The Arab League Foreign Ministers have said the Asad regime is responsible and called for ""deterrent and necessary measures against the culprits of this crime."" The Organization of Islamic Cooperation, its General Secretariat has called the attack a ""blatant affront to all religious and moral values and a deliberate disregard of international laws and norms, which requires a decisive action.""
So, in the coming days, I'll continue to consult with my fellow leaders around the world, and I will continue to consult with Congress. And I will make the best case that I can to the American people, as well as to the international community, for taking necessary and appropriate action. And I intend to address the American people from the White House on Tuesday.
The kind of world we live in and our ability to deter this kind of outrageous behavior is going to depend on the decisions that we make in the days ahead. And I'm confident that if we deliberate carefully and we choose wisely and embrace our responsibilities, we can meet the challenges of this moment as well as those in the days ahead.
So with that, let me take some questions. I've got my handy list. And I will start with Julie Pace from AP.
Syria/President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia/Former National Security Agency Contractor Edward J. Snowden
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned the number of countries that have condemned the use of chemical weapons——
The President. Yes.
Q.——but your advisers also say you're leaving this summit with a strong number of countries backing your call for military action. President Putin, just a short time ago, indicated it may only be a handful of countries, including France, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia. Can you tell us publicly what countries are backing your call for military action? And did you change any minds here? President Putin also mentioned your meeting with him earlier today. Can you tell us how that came about, and did you discuss both Syria and Edward Snowden? Thank you.
The President. I believe that there will be a statement issued later this evening—although hopefully in time for you guys to file back home—that indicates some of the additional countries that are making public statements.
Last night we had a good discussion. And I want to give President Putin credit that he facilitated, I think, a full airing of views on the issue. And here's how I would describe it, without giving the details or betraying the confidence of those who were speaking within the confines of the dinner. It was unanimous that chemical weapons were used—a unanimous conclusion that chemical weapons were used in Syria. There was a unanimous view that the norm against using chemical weapons has to be maintained, that these weapons were banned for a reason, and that the international community has to take those norms seriously.
I would say that the majority of the room is comfortable with our conclusion that Asad—the Asad Government—was responsible for their use. Obviously, this is disputed by President Putin. But if you polled the leaders last night, I am confident that you'd get a majority who said it is most likely—we are pretty confident—that the Asad regime used them.
Where there is a division has to do with the United Nations. There are a number of countries that, just as a matter of principle, believe that if military action is to be taken it needs to go through the U.N. Security Council. There are others—and I put myself in this camp, as somebody who's a strong supporter of the United Nations, who very much appreciates the courage of the investigators who had gone in and looks forward to seeing the U.N. report, because I think we should try to get more information, not less in this situation—it is my view and a view that was shared by a number of people in the room that given Security Council paralysis on this issue, if we are serious about upholding a ban on chemical weapons use, then an international response is required, and that will not come through Security Council action.
And that's where, I think, the division comes from. And I respect those who are concerned about setting precedents of action outside of a U.N. Security Council resolution. I would greatly prefer working through multilateral channels and through the United Nations to get this done. But ultimately, what I believe in even more deeply, because I think that the security of the world and—my particular task, looking out for the national security of the United States—requires that when there's a breach this brazen of a norm this important, and the international community is paralyzed and frozen and doesn't act, then that norm begins to unravel.
And if that norm unravels, then other norms and prohibitions start unraveling. And that makes for a more dangerous world. And that then requires even more difficult choices and more difficult responses in the future.
Over 4—1,400 people were gassed. Over 400 of them were children. This is not something we've fabricated. This is not something that we are looking—are using as an excuse for military action. As I said last night, I was elected to end wars, not start them. I've spent the last 4½ years doing everything I can to reduce our reliance on military power as a means of meeting our international obligations and protecting the American people. But what I also know is, is that there are times where we have to make hard choices if we're going to stand up for the things that we care about. And I believe that this is one of those times.
And if we end up using the U.N. Security Council not as a means of enforcing international norms and international law, but rather as a barrier to acting on behalf of international norms and international law, then I think people, rightly, are going to be pretty skeptical about the system and whether it can work to protect those children that we saw in those videos.
And sometimes, the further we get from the horrors of that, the easier it is to rationalize not making tough choices. And I understand that. This is not convenient. This is not something that I think a lot of folks around the world find an appetizing set of choices. But the question is, do these norms mean something? And if we're not acting, what does that say?
If we're just issuing another statement of condemnation, if we're passing resolutions saying, wasn't that terrible? If people who decry international inaction in Rwanda and say how terrible it is that there are these human rights violations that take place around the world and why aren't we doing something about it—and they always look to the United States. Why isn't the United States doing something about this, the most powerful nation on Earth? Why are you allowing these terrible things to happen? And then, if the international community turns around when we're saying it's time to take some responsibility and says, ""Well, hold on a second, we're not sure,"" that erodes our ability to maintain the kind of norms that we're looking at.
Now, I know that was a lengthy answer and you had a second part to your question.
The conversation I had with President Putin was on the margins of the plenary session, and it was a candid and constructive conversation, which characterizes my relationship with him. I know, as I've said before, everybody is always trying to look for body language and all that. But the truth of the matter is, is that my interactions with him tend to be very straightforward. We discussed Syria, and that was primarily the topic of conversation. Mr. Snowden did not come up beyond me saying that—reemphasizing that where we have common interests, I think it's important for the two of us to work together.
And on Syria, I said, listen, I don't expect us to agree on this issue of chemical weapons use, although it is possible that after the U.N. inspectors' report, it may be more difficult for Mr. Putin to maintain his current position about the evidence. But what I did say is that we both agree that the underlying conflict can only be resolved through a political transition as envisioned by the Geneva I and Geneva II process. And so we need to move forward together. Even if you—the U.S. and Russia and other countries disagree on this specific issue of how to respond to chemical weapons use, it remains important for us to work together to try to urge all parties in the conflict to try to resolve it.
Because we've got 4 million people internally displaced. We've got millions of people in Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon who are desperate, and the situation is only getting worse. And that's not in anybody's interests. It's not in America's interest. It's not in Russia's interest. It's not in the interest of the people in the region, and obviously, it's not in the interest of Syrians who've seen their lives completely disrupted and their country shattered.
So that is going to continue to be a project of ours. And that does speak to an issue that has been raised back home around this whole issue. You've heard some people say, well, we think if you're going to do something, you got to do something big, and maybe this isn't big enough or maybe it's too late, or other responses like that. And what I've tried to explain is we may not solve the whole problem, but this particular problem of using chemical weapons on children, this one we might have an impact on, and that's worth acting on. That's important to us.
And what I've also said is, is that as far as the underlying conflict is concerned, unless the international community is willing to put massive numbers of troops on the ground—and I know nobody is signing up for that—we're not going to get a long-term military solution for the country. And we're—and that is something that can only come about, I think, if, as different as our perspectives may be, myself, Mr. Putin, and others are willing to set aside those differences and put some pressure on the parties on the ground. Okay?
Brianna [Brianna Keilar, CNN].
Syria/Congressional Authorization for the Use of Military Force
Q. On the resolution to authorize the use of force, one of the big challenges right now isn't just Republicans, but it's from some of your loyal Democrats. It seems that the more they hear from classified briefings that the less likely they are to support you. If the full Congress doesn't pass this, will you go ahead with the strike? And also, Senator Susan Collins—one of the few Republicans who breaks through her party to give you support at times—she says: ""What if we execute the strike and then Asad decides to use chemical weapons again? Do we strike again?"" And many Democrats are asking that as well. How do you answer her question?
The President. Well, first of all, in terms of the votes and the process in Congress, I knew this was going to be a heavy lift. I said that on Saturday when I said we're going to take it to Congress. Our polling operations are pretty good. I tend to have a pretty good sense of what current popular opinion is. And for the American people, who have been through over a decade of war now, with enormous sacrifice in blood and treasure, any hint of further military entanglements in the Middle East are going to be viewed with suspicion. And that suspicion will probably be even stronger in my party than in the Republican Party, since a lot of the people who supported me remember that I opposed the war in Iraq.
And what's also true is, is that that experience with the war in Iraq colors how people view this situation, not just back home in America, but also here in Europe and around the world. That's the prism through a lot of people—through which a lot of people are analyzing the situation.
So I understand the skepticism. I think it is very important, therefore, for us to work through systematically making the case to every Senator and every Member of Congress. And that's what we're doing.
I dispute a little bit, Brianna, the notion that people come out of classified briefings and they're less in favor of it. I think that when they go through the classified briefings, they feel pretty confident that, in fact, chemical weapons were used and that the Asad regime used them.
The—where you will see resistance is people being worried about a slippery slope and how effective a limited action might be. And our response, based on my discussions with our military, is that we can have a response that is limited, that is proportional, that—when I say ""limited,"" it's both in time and in scope—but that is meaningful and that degrades Asad's capacity to deliver chemical weapons not just this time, but also in the future, and serves as a strong deterrent.
Now, is it possible that Asad doubles down in the face of our action and uses chemical weapons more widely? I suppose anything is possible, but it wouldn't be wise. I think at that point, mobilizing the international community would be easier, not harder. I think it would be pretty hard for the U.N. Security Council at that point to continue to resist the requirement for action, and we would gladly join with an international coalition to make sure that it stops.
So the—one of the biggest concerns of the American people—certain Members of Congress may have different concerns; there may be certain Members of Congress who say we've got to do even more or claim to have previously criticized me for not hitting Asad and now are saying they're going to vote no, and you'll have to ask them exactly how they square that circle. But for the American people at least, the concern really has to do with understanding that what we're describing here would be limited and proportionate and designed to address this problem of chemical weapons use and upholding a norm that helps keep all of us safe.
And that is going to be the case that I try to make not just to Congress, but to the American people over the coming days. Okay?
Syria/Congressional Authorization for the Use of Military Force/U.S. Foreign Policy
Q. Just a follow-up: Must you have full Congressional approval? What if the Senate votes yes and the House does not, for instance? Would you go ahead with the strike?
The President. Brianna, I think it would be a mistake for me to jump the gun and speculate, because right now I'm working to get as much support as possible out of Congress. But I'll repeat something that I said in Sweden when I was asked a similar question. I did not put this before Congress just as a political ploy or as symbolism. I put it before Congress because I could not honestly claim that the threat posed by Asad's use of chemical weapons on innocent civilians and women and children posed a imminent, direct threat to the United States. In that situation, obviously, I don't worry about Congress. We do what we have to do to keep the American people safe. I could not say that it was immediately, directly going to have an impact on our allies. Again, in those situations, I would act right away. This wasn't even a situation like Libya, where you've got troops rolling towards Benghazi and you have a concern about time in terms of saving somebody right away.
This was an event that happened. My military assured me that we could act today, tomorrow, a month from now; that we could do so proportionately, but meaningfully. And in that situation, I think it is important for us to have a serious debate in the United States about these issues.
Because these are going to be the kinds of national security threats that are most likely to recur over the next 5, 10 years. They're very few countries who are going to go at us directly. I mean, we have to be vigilant, but our military is unmatched. Those countries that are large and powerful like Russia or China, we have the kind of relationship with them where we're not getting in conflicts of that sort. At least over the last several decades, there's been a recognition that neither country benefits from that kind of great power conflict.
So the kinds of national security threats that we're going to confront, they're terrorist threats; they're failed states; they are the proliferation of deadly weapons. And in those circumstances, a President is going to have to make a series of decisions about which one of these threats over the long term starts making us less and less safe. And where we can work internationally, we should.
There are going to be times, though, where—as is true here—the international community is stuck for a whole variety of political reasons. And if that's the case, people are going to look to the United States and say, what are you going to do about it?
And that's not a responsibility that we always enjoy. There was a leader of a smaller country who I've spoken to over the last several days who said: ""You know, I don't envy you, because I'm a small country and nobody expects me to do anything about chemical weapons around the world. They know I have no capacity to do something.""
And it's tough because people do look to the United States. And the question for the American people is, is that responsibility that we'll be willing to bear? And I believe that when you have a limited, proportional strike like this—not Iraq, not putting boots on the ground; not some long, drawn-out affair; not without any risks, but with manageable risks—that we should be willing to bear that responsibility.
Chuck Todd [NBC News].
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Good morning—or good evening. I think it's still ""good morning"" for—back home.
The President. By tonight it will be tonight——
Q. Fair enough.
The President. ——when we get back home. [Laughter] Yes.
Syria/Congressional Authorization for the Use of Military Force
Q. I think we're all relieved. I want to follow up on Brianna's question, because it seems these Members of Congress are simply responding to their constituents——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——and you're seeing a lot these town halls, and it seems as if the more you press your case, the more John Kerry presses the case on your behalf, the more the opposition grows. And maybe it's just—or the more the opposition becomes vocal. Why do you think you've struggled with that? And you keep talking about a limited mission. We have a report that indicates you've actually asked for an expanded list of targets in Syria, and one military official told NBC News, he characterized it as ""mission creep."" Can you respond to that report?
The President. That report is inaccurate. I'm not going to comment on operational issues that are sourced by some military official. One thing I've got a pretty clear idea about is what I talked with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff about, and what we have consistently talked about is something limited and proportional that would degrade Mr. Asad's capabilities.
In terms of opposition, Chuck, I expected this. This is hard, and I was under no illusions when I embarked on this path. But I think it's the right thing to do. I think it's good for our democracy. We will be more effective if we are unified going forward.
And part of what we knew would be—that there would be some politics and interjecting themselves——
Q. You believe it's all politics?
The President. No, I said ""some."" But what I have also said is, is that the American people have gone through a lot when it comes to the military over the last decade or so. And so I understand that. And when you starting talking about chemical weapons and their proliferation, those images of those bodies can sometimes be forgotten pretty quickly. The news cycle moves on.
Frankly, if we weren't talking about the need for an international response right now, this wouldn't be what everybody would be asking about. There would be some resolutions that were being proffered in the United Nations and the usual hocus-pocus, but the world and the country would have moved on.
So trying to impart a sense of urgency about this—why we can't have an environment in which, over time, people start thinking, we can get away with chemical weapons use—it's a hard sell, but it's something I believe in. And as I explained to Brianna, in this context, me making sure that the American people understand it, I think, is important before I take action.
Jon Karl [ABC News].
Syria/Congressional Authorization for the Use of Military Force
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. One of your closest allies in the House said yesterday, ""When you've got 97 percent of your constituents saying no, it's kind of hard to say yes."" Why should Members of Congress go against the will of their constituents and to support your decision on this? And I still haven't heard a direct response to Brianna's question: If Congress fails to authorize this, will you go forward with an attack on Syria?
The President. Right, and you're not getting a direct response. [Laughter] Brianna asked the question very well. I mean, did you think that——
Q. Well, it's a pretty basic question.
The President. ——I was going to give you a different answer? No. [Laughter] What I have said, and I will repeat, is that I put this before Congress for a reason. I think we will be more effective and stronger if, in fact, Congress authorizes this action. I'm not going to engage in parlor games now, Jonathan, about whether or not it's going to pass when I'm talking substantively to Congress about why this is important and talking to the American people about why this is important.
Now, with respect to Congress and how they should respond to constituency concerns, I do consider it part of my job to help make the case and to explain to the American people exactly why I think this is the right thing to do. And it's conceivable that at the end of the day, I don't persuade a majority of the American people that it's the right thing to do. And then, each Member of Congress is going to have to decide, if I think it's the right thing to do for America's national security and the world's national security, then how do I vote? And you know what? That's what you're supposed to do as a Member of Congress. Ultimately, you listen to your constituents, but you've also got to make some decisions about what you believe is right for America.
And that's the same for me as President of the United States. There are a whole bunch of decisions that I make that are unpopular, as you well know. But I do so because I think they're the right thing to do. And I trust my constituents want me to offer my best judgment. That's why they elected me. That's why they reelected me even after there were some decisions I made that they disagreed with. And I would hope that Members of Congress would end up feeling the same way.
The last point I would make: These kinds of interventions, these kinds of actions are always unpopular because they seem distant and removed. And I want to make sure I'm being clear. I'm not drawing a analogy to World War II other than to say when London was getting bombed it was profoundly unpopular both in Congress and around the country to help the British. It doesn't mean it wasn't the right thing to do. It just means people are struggling with jobs and bills to pay and they don't want their sons or daughters put in harm's way and these entanglements far away are dangerous and different.
I—to bring the analogy closer to home, the intervention in Kosovo, very unpopular. But ultimately, I think it was the right thing to do. And the international community should be glad that it came together to do it.
When people say that it is a terrible stain on all of us that hundreds of thousands of people were slaughtered in Rwanda, well, imagine if Rwanda was going on right now, and we asked, should we intervene in Rwanda? I think it's fair to say that it probably wouldn't poll real well.
So, typically, when any kind of military action is popular, it's because either there's been a very clear, direct threat to us—9/11—or an administration uses various hooks to suggest that American interests were directly threatened, like in Panama or Grenada. And sometimes, those hooks are more persuasive than others, but typically, they're not put before Congress. And again, we just went through something pretty tough with respect to Iraq. So all that, I guess, provides some context for why you might expect people to be resistant to it.
Q. But your Deputy National Security Adviser said that it is not your intention to attack if Congress doesn't approve it. Is he right?
The President. I don't think that's exactly what he said. But I think I've answered the question.
Major Garrett [CBS News].
Syria/Chemical Weapons
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Those of us who remember covering your campaign remember you saying that militarily,"," when the United States acts, it's not just important what it does, but how it goes about doing it; and that even when America sets its course, it's important to engage the international community and listen to different ideas even as it's pursuing that action. I wonder if you leave here and return to Washington, seeing the skepticism there, hearing it here, with any different ideas that might delay military action. For example, some in Congress have suggested giving the Syrian regime 45 days to sign the Chemical Weapons Convention, get rid of its chemical stockpiles, do something that would enhance international sense of accountability for Syria, but delay military action. Are you, Mr. President, looking at any of these ideas? Or are we on a fast track to military action as soon as Congress renders its judgment one way or the other?
The President. I am listening to all these ideas. And some of them are constructive. And I'm listening to ideas in Congress, and I'm listening to ideas here. Look, I want to repeat here: My goal is to maintain the international norm on banning chemical weapons. I want that enforcement to be real. I want it to be serious. I want people to understand that gassing innocent people, delivering chemical weapons against children is not something we do. It's prohibited in active wars between countries. We certainly don't do it against kids. And we've got to stand up for that principle.
If there are tools that we can use to ensure that, obviously my preference would be, again, to act internationally in a serious way and to make sure that Mr. Asad gets the message.
I'm not itching for military action. Recall, Major, that I have been criticized for the last couple of years by some of the folks who are now saying they would oppose these strikes for not striking. And I think that I have a well-deserved reputation for taking very seriously and soberly the idea of military engagement.
So we will look at these ideas. So far, at least, I have not seen ideas presented that, as a practical matter, I think would do the job. But this is a situation where part of the reason I wanted to foster debate was to make sure that everybody thought about both the ramifications of action and inaction.
Q. So currently, the only way to enforce this international norm is militarily and even giving us—the Asad regime extra time would not achieve your goals?
The President. What I'm saying, Major, is that so far, what we've seen is a escalation by the Asad regime of chemical weapons use.
You'll recall that several months ago, I said we now say with some confidence that at a small level Asad has used chemical weapons. We not only sent warnings to Asad, but we demarched, meaning we sent a strong message through countries that have relationships with Asad, that he should not be doing this. And rather than hold the line, we ended up with what we saw on August 21. So this is not as if we haven't tested the proposition that the guy—or at least generals under his charge—can show restraint when it comes to this stuff. And they've got one of the largest stockpiles in the world.
But I want to emphasize that we continue to consult with our international partners. I'm listening to Congress. I'm not just doing the talking. And if there are good ideas that are worth pursuing then I'm going to be open to it.
I will take last question. Tangi, AFP [Tangi Quemener, Agence France-Presse].
National Security Agency's Electronic Surveillance Program/President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil/President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Yesterday night you had two unscheduled bilateral meetings with your Brazilian and Mexican counterparts after they voiced very strong concerns about being allegedly targeted by the NSA. What was your message to them? And do these revelations—that constant stream of revelations since the start of this summer—make it harder for you to build confidence with your partners in international forums such as this one?
The President. Good. The—I did meet with President Rousseff as well as President Peña Nieto, of Brazil and Mexico, respectively, to discuss these allegations that were made in the press about the NSA. I won't share with you all the details of the conversation, but what I said to them is consistent with what I've said publicly. The United States has an intelligence agency, and our intelligence agency's job is to gather information that's not available through public sources. If they were available through public sources, then they wouldn't be an intelligence agency. In that sense, what we do is similar to what countries around the world do with their intelligence services.
But what is true is that we are bigger; we have greater capabilities. The difference between our capabilities and other countries probably tracks the differences in military capabilities between countries. And what I've said is that because technology is changing so rapidly, because these capabilities are growing, it is important for us to step back and review what it is that we're doing, because just because we can get information doesn't necessarily always mean that we should.
There may be costs and benefits to doing certain things, and we've got to weigh those. And I think that, traditionally, what's happened over decades is the general assumption was, well, you just—whatever you can get, you just kind of pull in, and then you kind of sift through later and try to figure out what's useful. The nature of technology and the legitimate concerns around privacy and civil liberties means that it's important for us on the front end to say, all right, are we actually going to get useful information here? And if not—or how useful is it? If it's not that important, should we be more constrained in how we use certain technical capabilities?
Now, just more specifically, then, on Brazil and Mexico: I said that I would look into the allegations. I mean, part of the problem here is, we get these through the press, and then I've got to go back and find out what's going on with respect to these particular allegations. I don't subscribe to all these newspapers, and—although I think the NSA does, now at least. [Laughter]
And then, what I assured President Rousseff and President Peña Nieto is, is that they should take—that I take these allegations very seriously; I understand their concerns; I understand the concerns of the Mexican and Brazilian people—and that we will work with their teams to resolve what is a source of tension.
Now, the last thing I'd say about this, though, is just because there are tensions doesn't mean that it overrides all the incredibly wide-ranging interests that we share with so many of these countries. And there's a reason why I went to Brazil. There's a reason why I invited President Rousseff to come to the United States. Brazil is an incredibly important country. It is a amazing success story in terms of a transition from authoritarianism to democracy. It is one of the most dynamic economies in the world. And obviously, for the two largest nations in the hemisphere to have a strong relationship, that can only be good for the people of our two countries, as well as the region. Same is true with Mexico, one of our closest friends, allies, and neighbors.
And so we will work through this particular issue. It does not detract from the larger concerns that we have and the opportunities that we both want to take advantage of.
All right? Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, St. Petersburg."

Harper of Canada in Toluca, Mexico",Barack Obama,"Barack Obama, The President's News Conference With President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico and Prime Minister Stephen J. Harper of Canada in Toluca, Mexico Online by Gerhard Peters and John T.

Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. Members of the media; Your Excellency, President of the United States of America Barack Obama; Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper: Once again, I would like to welcome you to our country.
It is a great honor to have hosted you for the North American Leaders' Summit here in the State of Mexico and Toluca, its capital city, a State that I had the great honor of being the Governor of before I took office with the greatest honor in the world of politics, and that is to lead the course of my country.
That is why I am very glad that we have had the opportunity of having this meeting. And I would like to congratulate myself for creating a space where we have had dialogues, where we have outreach to our countries, and where we have strengthened our friendship. I can be certain that the warm space where we have met is very different from what the teams of men and women representing Mexico in Sochi are having in Russia. They are in a very cold weather and fighting hard to win a medal. So be welcome to this very warm weather.
I would like to present to you a summary; I would to summarize for the media and for your delegations the scope of our meetings. I would like to share with you that we have two highlights in our meetings. First, we had a bilateral with President Barack Obama and with his delegation and their counterparts from Mexico to address the following, and I would like to share this with you.
First of all, we assessed the breakthroughs related to the agreements made during President's Obama past visit in May to our country and now during his fifth visit. And I must note that Mexico ranks top of the list of the most visited countries by President Obama during this term. And we were able to identify the level of progress of the agreements made back then; how much we have advanced the exchange between high-level officials to precisely boost the trade and commercial relationship that Mexico and the U.S. have.
We have also analyzed the possibility of setting forward new mechanisms to build and fund strategic projects. We have agreed to work on a proposal that would help us find different mechanisms to fund projects so that we can give a new life to our infrastructure, to have a more agile and have safer commercial transactions between our countries.
Specifically, we talked about education, and we have set to the task to have more academic exchanges so that more Mexican students can study in the United States and, reciprocally, students from the United States come to Mexico to study. The number of students so far is somehow low, considering the potential that we have. And out of the 14,000 students that Mexico go to the United States to study, we have set a goal and that is to increase year by year this figure and reach 100,000 students a year that visit the United States and 50,000 students from the U.S. coming to Mexico to study.
We have revised our security agenda and we have agreed to maintain a strategic dialogue, to coordinate efforts so we can face a common issue: security in both of our countries and, specifically, security at the border.
On the other hand, I would like to refer to the outcome of the North American Leaders' Summit. Therefore, I would like to share with you a—highlights in terms of the agreements reached in this framework. We have worked on four main topics. The first one is to foster a shared and inclusive prosperity. We have agreed to work on a plan to boost competitiveness. We also have agreed to work on a North America transport plan, which would give us better infrastructure in our three countries to make the commerce that happens between our three nations thrive.
We also agreed to standardize and expedite all the procedures that take place at our customhouses. We have also agreed to enable the movement of individuals and, by this, have Trusted Travelers Programs. We have, each one, a program of this nature with a purpose in mind that all the travelers that are part of the Trusted Travelers registers in our countries is considered as a vetted traveler in North America.
Additionally, in terms of the second topic, we have addressed areas of opportunity. And I must insist, in terms of our binational agenda with the United States, we have added up Canada to work on a program to train professionals by increasing our academic exchanges and ensuring mobility of students between our three countries.
We have also agreed to foster sustainable development, working towards the mitigation of the effects of climate change. And in the area of sustainability, we have also agreed to work on the preservation of the Monarch butterfly. It is a landmark species in North America. This is a species present in our three countries, and we have agreed to work a task force with a presentation from our three countries to preserve the Monarch butterfly.
Then, another topic is citizen security and regional topics. We have agreed to give privilege to the exchange of information, and we have also privilege to coordinate efforts between law enforcement authorities. We will reinforce the measures aimed to fight money laundering and illicit financial flows. And for that purpose, we need to integrate our financial systems further.
We have also restated our commitment to support and cooperate with the Central America region as well as the Caribbean because they are partners in this hemisphere. We have committed to foster development, economic growth, and citizen security as well.
Basically, I have summarized the commitments made during the summit. And fourthly, we have committed, the three of us, to give follow-up to all the agreements made. We—besides making agreements, we have committed to give follow-up to each one of those agreements and we have committed to make them happen.
Finally, I would like to share with you that in order to reach our goals, we need to identify that North America is quite valuable. The free trade agreement executed 20 years ago and the intense dialogue that we have between our three countries in the North American region is very valuable, and every exchange is based on trust. And we share a very good relationship between all of us who lead our countries.
This North American Leaders' Summit has been a very good opportunity to specify what our commitments will be and what are the tasks for the future. And it has also served as a space to restate our friendship, the good relationship that we have, and the respect that we pay to each other. And we have committed to work hard to make a significant contribution, to make North America a more competitive region, I would dare to say, the most competitive region in the world. And this is a region that has a true call for prosperity. And we will work to provide better well-being to the citizens of our countries.
We have made great strides. We create plenty of jobs due to the economic relationship that we have managed to achieve, but we want more. We want more development. We are aware of the potential that we find in North America. And I make a pledge so that the seventh summit of leaders of North America serves its purpose.
Once again, we welcome, and I would like to say that I hope you have had a very pleasant stay in Toluca, and I hope that this visit has been very fruitful. And I hope that we have been able to build an even stronger relationship.
Thank you.
[At this point, the moderator introduced President Obama.]
President Obama. Buenas noches. To President Peña Nieto, to the people of Toluca and the people of Mexico, thank you so much for your extraordinary hospitality. Thank you again, Enrique, for welcoming us to your hometown and home State, which, like the beautiful surroundings tonight, reflects Mexico's proud history as well as the economic dynamism of today's Mexico.
I want to thank Presidents Peña Nieto and Prime Minister Harper for their partnership in deepening the extraordinary ties between our countries, especially the trade that supports good jobs for our people. For the United States, Canada and Mexico are two of our largest trading partners, with trade that supports millions of American jobs. Thanks in part to our efforts to boost U.S. exports, American exports to Canada and Mexico continue to grow faster than our exports to the rest of the world.
Together, our countries have strengths that give North America a tremendous competitive advantage: the skills of our workers, manufacturing that's growing, and new sources of energy. And so we have to take advantage of these competitive advantages, and we need to do it together. All of this positions us to be a powerhouse in the global economy. And that's why we're here, to make sure that we're doing everything we can to be more competitive and create more jobs: in Canada, in Mexico, and in the United States.
First, we're focused on making it easier to trade. Earlier today I signed a new Executive order to make it easier for companies that want to export and import. Instead of dealing with dozens of different Federal agencies and long paper forms, we're going to create a one-stop shop online so companies can submit all their information in one place and save themselves time and money. We're going to keep investing in infrastructure—like roads, bridges, border crossings—so our goods are getting to market faster. We've agreed to keep working to make it easier for our businesspeople and tourists to trade and travel. And we're going to step up our efforts to streamline and eliminate regulations or the redtape that can sometimes stifle trade and job creation.
We've agreed to keep working to complete negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, including strong protections for our workers and the environment, so that we can compete in the fast-growing markets of the Asia-Pacific. And because it will grow the U.S. economy and make the United States more attractive to investment and because we have to do right by our families and our values, I've reiterated that immigration reform remains one of my highest priorities.
I'm also very pleased that we've agreed to keep expanding educational partnerships, as Enrique mentioned, so our young people develop the skills they need to succeed in a global economy. And this builds on my initiative that we call 100,000 Strong in the Americas. We want more students from the United States studying throughout the hemisphere, and we want more students from places like Mexico and Canada studying in the United States, so that they're developing familiarity and partnerships and friendships that will serve them and serve our countries well for decades to come.
Second, we continue to deepen our clean energy partnerships, which create jobs and combat climate change. Yesterday I announced that the United States will develop new fuel economy standards for heavy-duty trucks, standards that reduce carbon pollution. And today all three of our nations have agreed to work together to meet high fuel standards for these heavy-duty trucks.
And more broadly, we agreed to join with our Central American and Caribbean partners on a regional energy strategy. And this builds on the commitment I made in Central America last year to help our partners across the region reduce their energy costs and become more competitive. On a global level, we agreed to keep standing together as we push for an international agreement to phase down the production and consumption of dangerous hydrofluorocarbons.
Number three, we know that realizing our full potential as individual countries and as a region means confronting the criminals and narcotraffickers who unleash so much violence on our citizens. Here in Mexico, the security forces and the Mexican people continue to make enormous sacrifices in that fight, and our three nations are united against this threat. In the United States, we continue to be committed to reduce the demand for illegal drugs, and we'll continue our unprecedented efforts to combat the southbound flow of illegal guns and cash.
And finally, given our shared commitment to democratic values and human rights, I want to take this opportunity to address the situation in Venezuela and Ukraine and the unacceptable violence in those two countries, which the United States strongly condemns.
In Venezuela, rather than trying to distract from its own failings by making up false accusations against diplomats from the United States, the Government ought to focus on addressing the legitimate grievances of the Venezuelan people. So, along with the Organization of American States, we call on the Venezuelan Government to release protestors that it's detained and engage in real dialogue. And all parties have an obligation to work together to restrain violence and restore calm.
With regard to Ukraine, along with our European partners, we will continue to engage all sides. And we continue to stress to President Yanukovych and the Ukrainian Government that they have the primary responsibility to prevent the kind of terrible violence that we've seen, to withdraw riot police, to work with the opposition to restore security and human dignity and move the country forward. And this includes progress towards a multiparty technical government that can work with the international community on a support package and adopt reforms necessary for free and fair elections next year.
Ukrainians are a proud and resilient people who have overcome extraordinary challenges in their history, and that's a pride and strength that I hope they draw on now. Meanwhile, I've urged the military in Ukraine to show restraint and to let civilians pursue the dialogue necessary for progress. We've obviously seen reports of a truce between the Government and the opposition. If the truce is implemented, it could provide space for the sides to resolve their disagreements peacefully.
And going forward, we'll continue to do whatever we can to support Ukrainians as they seek a peaceful solution and respond to the aspirations of the Ukrainian people for a strong, unified democracy that's fully integrated into the international community.
So again, I want to thank Enrique and the people of Mexico and the people of Toluca for their wonderful hospitality. If we stay focused on our shared vision of a North America that's more integrated and more competitive, then progress in each of our countries will mean more prosperity and opportunity for everyone.
So thank you very much.
[The moderator introduced Prime Minister Harper. Prime Minister Harper then spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Prime Minister Harper. Allow me to start out by thanking President Peña Nieto for his generous hospitality. We have had a wonderful stay in this wonderful country, in Mexico, and we are eager to come back soon.
Today I had fruitful meetings and dialogues with my commercial partners from Mexico and in regard to services, information, and also shared and fundamental values and, of course, a democratic and peaceful world.
Today we celebrate the 20th anniversary of NAFTA. As time can tell us, this treaty was successful, and it started guaranteeing prosperity from one extreme to the other of the hemisphere. The volume of exchanges has—is fourfold now and is over $30 billion. And we have now seen exponential growth and can hope for exponential growth in years to go.
We are in agreement to say that we can still grow the success of NAFTA, to implement new ways, for instance, in regard to the Trans-Pacific alliance. And so these negotiations should be for the best. The—we need to create employments. This is the key to revitalize the economy and to foster prosperity not only for the Canadian populations for—but for our populations at large.
That's why our government will keep on working and expanding the free trade and commerce with his main partners in North America, as well as with Asia-Pacific regions and in—the world wide, since we want to have access on the other side of the Atlantic, since we have subscribed the free exchange agreement with Europe.
Today President Obama, President Peña Nieto, and myself have discussed and have delved into many topics, especially the state of the world economy at a local, regional level, and competiveness, North American competitiveness. We are truly enthusiastic to collaborate, with this idea of collaborating together. We shall keep on working together with my homologues [counterparts]* and to make and to take a profit of all the occasions for the well-being of our populations. And we will host the forthcoming population of the summit in Canada.
And I would like to add a word in regard to the situation in Ukraine. We—there's been a truce, but we—it is essential that we take action. And at the end of the day, the Ukrainian Government has to be held responsible for settling this situation. The Ukrainian Government took actions, actions that were not only unpopular, but actions that put at risk nature and the aspirations of Ukrainians of becoming an independent nation.
[Prime Minister Harper repeated his remarks in English as follows.]
My sincere thanks to President Peña Nieto and the Mexican people for their generous hospitality. We've had a wonderful time here in beautiful Mexico, and I look forward to returning again soon.
Today we had productive meetings with Canada's closest friends and trading partners, partners with whom we share goods, services, and information, and also fundamental values and a vision for a democratic and peaceful world.
This year we mark the 20th anniversary of the North American Free Trade Agreement. And as only time can reveal, the agreement—statistics alone—has been an overwhelming—has been overwhelmingly successful and is responsible for creating prosperity from the bottom to the top of the continent. There has been a fourfold growth in trilateral trade over the last 20 years that now exceeds a trillion dollars. And it is estimated that the NAFTA marketplace will continue to expand exponentially in the decades to come.
We all agree that there is enormous potential to build on the success of NAFTA in new ways, for example, most notably through the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We're therefore focused on bringing those negotiations to a successful conclusion.
Developing trade is one of the keys to job creation. It is a key to economic vitality, and it is a key to long-term prosperity not just for the Canadian people, but for all of our peoples. That's why our government will continue to work to expand trade with our two core trading partners in North America, in the Asia-Pacific region more generally, and around the world, just as we did last year, when we expanded our access across the Atlantic through the conclusion of the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement.
In our meetings today, Presidents Peña Nieto, Obama, and I discussed a range of topics as have already been detailed by my colleagues, including the state of the global economy, international regional security, and North American competitiveness. We share a genuine enthusiasm for closer collaboration.
The Presidents and I will continue to work together to address the challenges of the 21st century and to seize the many promising opportunities that the future holds for our peoples. And I do look forward to hosting the next North American Leaders' Summit in Canada.
And I'd also just like to conclude with a word on the situation in Ukraine. We obviously are encouraged to hear the news of a truce. While this is good news, this kind of news, these kinds of words are only meaningful if they are put into action. And ultimately, it is the regime that is responsible for resolving the current situation. It is the regime that created this situation, not by taking decisions that were merely unpopular, but by undertaking decisions that went against the very nature and aspirations of Ukraine as an independent state. And for that reason, we hold the Government responsible and urge them to take all the steps necessary to resolve the situation and to put Ukraine back on the democratic and Euro-Atlantic path that the Ukrainian people desire.
Moderator. We will have a round of questions. Jason McDonald will introduce the Canadian journalist asking the question.
Jason McDonald, Director of Communications, Office of the Prime Minister of Canada. Omar Sachedina from CTV News.
Keystone XL Pipeline Project/Climate Change
Q. Mr. President, good evening to you. Canada has offered to work with the United States on joint rules to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the oil and gas sector. You've said the Keystone XL pipeline won't be approved if it significantly worsens climate change. The State Department report has concluded that Keystone will not have a significant effect on climate change. So my question to you is, what more needs to be done on both sides of the border for this project to go ahead?
And, Prime Minister, I'd love for you to be able to weigh on this as well. Et en français aussi, s'il vous plaît.
President Obama. Well, as I've stated previously, there is a process that has been gone through, and I know it's been extensive and at times, I'm sure Stephen feels, a little too laborious. But these are how we make these decisions about something that could potentially have significant impact on America's national economy and our national interest.
So the State Department has gone through its review. There is now a comment period in which other agencies weigh in. That will be evaluated by Secretary of State Kerry, and we'll make a decision at that point.
In the meantime, Stephen and I, during a break after lunch, discussed a shared interest in working together around dealing with greenhouse gas emissions. And this is something that we have to deal with. I said previously that how Keystone impacted greenhouse gas emissions would affect our decision, but frankly, it has to affect all of our decisions at this stage, because the science is irrefutable. We're already seeing severe weather patterns increase. That has consequences for our businesses, for our jobs, for our families, for safety and security. It has the potential of displacing people in ways that we cannot currently fully anticipate and will be extraordinarily costly.
So I welcome the work that we can do together with Canada. One of the wonderful things about North America is, we have this amazing bounty of traditional fossil fuels, and we also have extraordinary businesses that are able to extract them in very efficient ways. And that's something that we should welcome because it helps to promote economic growth. But we only have one planet, and so I believe that ultimately, we can both promote economic development and growth, recognizing that we're not going to immediately transition off of fossil fuels, but that we do have to point to the future and show leadership so that other countries who will be the main emitters fairly soon—China, India, other emerging markets—so that they can look at what we're doing and we have leverage over them in terms of them improving their practices as well.
So this will be a joint effort. I'm very eager to consult with Stephen around those issues. And Keystone will proceed along the path that's already been set forth.
Prime Minister Harper. Let me just say a couple of things. First of all, obviously, President Obama and I had an exchange on this. My views in favor of the project are very well known. His views on the process are also equally well known. And we had that discussion and will continue on that discussion.
I would just say two things about the process. First, on the issue of climate change, which is a shared concern, Canada and the United States have similar targets at the international level. We already cooperate on several—in several sectors in terms of emissions reductions. But in terms of climate change, I think the State Department report already was pretty definitive on that particular issue.
The other thing I'd just draw attention to, just because I think it's useful to point out the benefits to Canada, is the reform that we have done in—of environmental review and assessments of projects in Canada. As you know, a couple years ago, we moved to reform our system so that we have a single review wherever possible—a single review, a multidimensional review—that happens over a fixed timeline. And I think that is a process that is tremendously useful in giving investors greater certainty in terms of the kind of plans they may have in the Canadian economy.
[Prime Minister Harper spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
And now I shall repeat my question—I shall repeat my comments in French.
We—President Obama has put the cornerstone, and I can only echo on the American process that President Obama has proposed. We already had a conversation in this regard. I'd like to add two comments in regard to this process. First, in regard to climate change, we do share these concerns not only in the United States, but worldwide. We are already collaborating in many sectors to abate the green gas effect emissions.
And at the same time, we have—we understand that the State Department conclusions are quite correct. And we wish to push forward the investments throughout North America. So we have established reviewal system for our peers in a determined and precise timeline. And this gives much better results for our investors.
Moderator. To—[inaudible]—from the White House will introduce the American journalist asking the question.]
White House Press Secretary James F. ""Jay"" Carney. From the traveling U.S. press, goes to Jim Kuhnhenn of the Associated Press.
U.S. Trade Policy/Trans-Pacific Partnership/Syria/Ukraine/Russia-U.S. Relations/President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia
Q. Señor Presidente, muchas gracias. Ha sido un placer. Señor Presidente, Prime Minister, about trade, do you worry that longstanding opposition to trade deals in the U.S. from both the President's party and some Republicans pose a threat to the Trans-Pacific Partnership? And do you—in your mind, is it essential that Congress approve it or at least give the President fast-track authority this year, or can it wait until after the U.S. elections in November?
Mr. President, if you'd like to chime in on that as well. You mentioned parochial interests today; I'd be interested in how you intend to bring your Democrats along. But I had a question for you on something else that you raised.
President Obama. How many questions do you got, Jim?
Q. Just one, sir.
President Obama. Okay. [Laughter] Because you know I've got to ask—answer that one too, right? That was a pretty slick move. [Laughter]
Q. The common denominator in the strife in Ukraine and Syria is the support that those two governments get from Russia, and I'm wondering, sir, if you believe that President Putin bears some responsibility for the intransigence of those two regimes. And to some degree, has this gone beyond just those two countries, and has it become a tug of war between two world powers?
President Obama. Let me answer very briefly on the trade issue. It's not accurate, Jim, to say that my party opposes this trade deal. There are elements in my party that opposes this trade deal, there are elements in my party that opposed the South Korea free trade agreement, the Colombia free trade agreement, and the Panama free trade agreement, all of which we passed with Democratic votes.
So what I've said to President Peña Nieto and Prime Minister Harper is, we'll get this passed if it's a good agreement. And the key at this point is to make sure that our countries, which hold ourselves up as champions of free trade, resolve our legitimate national interests in these negotiations so that we can present a united front against a number of the other participants in the TPP negotiations who don't have as much of a tradition of free trade. And that is to our advantage, precisely because North America has this amazing competitive advantage and we are already relatively open markets.
And part of our goal here is to make sure that the Asia-Pacific region—which is growing faster than anyplace else in the world, has a larger population than anyplace else in the world—that they have a model of trade that is free and fair and open and allows our businesses to compete and allows our workers to make goods and deliver services that those markets are purchasing. And we can only do that if we raise the bar in terms of what our trade models look like.
And I've said this to some of my own constituents who are opposed to trade: that those who are concerned about losing jobs or outsourcing need to understand, some of the old agreements put us at a disadvantage. That's exactly why we've got to have stronger agreements that protect our intellectual property, that open up markets to our agricultural products, that make sure that when it comes to government procurement or sovereign wealth funds in these other countries, that they're not taking advantage of our businesses and preventing us from competing there. That's exactly why we've got to get this done. And I'm very appreciative of the shared vision and commitment that Prime Minister Harper and President Enrique Peña Nieto have on this issue.
Now, with respect to Syria and the Ukraine, I do think it is worth noting that you have in this situation one country that has clearly been a client state of Russia, another whose Government is currently—been supported by Russia, where the people obviously have a very different view and vision for their country. And we've now seen a great deal of turmoil there that arose organically from within those countries.
I don't think there's a competition between the United States and Russia. I think this is an expression of the hopes and aspirations of people inside of Syria and people inside of the Ukraine who recognize that basic freedo","ms—freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, fair and free elections, the ability to run a business without paying a bribe, to not be discriminated against because of your religion or your beliefs—that those are fundamental rights that everybody wants to enjoy.
Now, Mr. Putin has a different view on many of those issues, and I don't think that there's any secret on that. And our approach as the United States is not to see these as some Cold War chessboard in which we're in competition with Russia. Our goal is to make sure that the people of Ukraine are able to make decisions for themselves about their future, that the people of Syria are able to make decisions without having bombs going off and killing women and children, or chemical weapons, or towns being starved because a despot wants to cling to power.
Those express our values and our national interests, and we will continue to express those national interests. There are times, I hope, where Russia will recognize that over the long term they should be on board with those values and interests as well. Right now there are times where we have strong disagreements. And when I speak to Mr. Putin, I'm very candid about those disagreements, even as we will continue to pursue cooperation with Russia on areas where we have shared concerns.
But I want to emphasize this: The situation that happened in Ukraine has to do with whether or not the people of Ukraine can determine their own destiny. And my Government and Vice President Biden, and I personally, have expressed to President Yanukovych the need for him to recognize the spirit of the Ukrainian people and work with that, as opposed to trying to repress it. And so we'll continue to stand on the side of the people.
My hope is, at this point, that a truce may hold, but Stephen's exactly right. Ultimately, the Government is responsible for making sure that we shift towards some sort of unity government, even if it's temporary, that allows us to move to fair and free elections so that the will of the Ukrainian people can be rightly expressed without the kinds of chaos we've seen on the streets and without the bloodshed that all of us, I think, strongly condemn.
Prime Minister Harper. I'll just—on the issue of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, as I said, we are wanting to see and committed to seeing a good, comprehensive Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. I think it's in all of our interests for the reasons that have already been laid out. That said, the Government of Canada's position is always clear in these matters that we will only come to an agreement when we are convinced the agreement is in the best interest of Canada. And we will stay at the table as long as it takes to get to that particular situation.
And I think we have the track record to prove it. Our Government, the current Government of Canada, has signed more trade agreements than all previous Canadian governments combined. What I would say is this—I'm not going to comment on the process in Congress. What I would say is this: The reason I said what I said about working until we get an agreement that is in the interest of Canada is we will have to have an agreement that can be sold to the Canadian Parliament and ultimately to the Canadian people. And that's what we're aiming for.
[Prime Minister Harper spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
I repeat: In regard to the Trans-Pacific agreement—alliance and in regard to our relations with the Asia-Pacific region, we have our own perspective. And we will negotiate up to the point where we will have an agreement on the table. And we need to show that our administration has subscribed more agreements than any other previous administrations. And so for the Canadian Government, it is essential to note that we can submit these proposals to the Canadian Parliament and of the line—[inaudible].
President Peña Nieto. The Mexican stand has been very clear, and specifically, our take on the TPP, we have always stated it: It is of the interest of Mexico. We have been part of the negotiation rounds to eventually reach an agreement of this important opportunity that the TPP offers. We can expand the potential of North America into the Asia-Pacific region. Mexico would do its best for the sake of Mexico to be on the side of the solution, overcome disagreements and eventual roadblocks that the negotiation rounds present. And we hope that it is this spirit that we reach the agreement.
Mexico has made a commitment and has shown political will to be part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We hope that the deal happens. That is the Mexican stand, and we will work to the best of our ability to reach this goal.
Now, on behalf of Mexico, Miguel Reyes Razo, from the Mexican Editorial Organization, will ask a question.
Mexican Economic Development/Mexico-U.S. Trade Relations
Q. Good evening, everyone. By virtue of the fact that we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the efforts made by Mexico, the United States, and Canada, we have NAFTA for 20 years. I would like to ask Enrique Peña Nieto, the President of my country, what is the outlook of the northern part of this continent in terms of development? And at the same time, Mr. President Peña Nieto, I would like to know, what are the challenges? What are the challenges for the development that we have hoped for, that we are expecting?
And I would like to ask the President of the United States of America, Mr. Obama, and Mr. Harper, Prime Minister of Canada, what is the engagement that we should expect from you? What is your actual commitment to make this region, North America, thrive in economical terms? Now, we have 13½ months of your administration, Mr. Enrique Peña Nieto. And you, Canada and the United States, partners and neighbors of this country, what is your take? What is your take on this 13 months and a half of the Mexican President? Thank you very much for your reply.
President Peña Nieto. Mr. Miguel, I believe that we have been very candid in terms of the huge strength that we see in North America after 20 years of the free trade agreement. Our trade has been able to thrive. We have more commercial exchanges. We have more investment in the region.
And today, we have integrated added value chains between our three countries. That means that we are adding value to products that are offered in this great market. We are fully aware of the economic growth since, so far, we are fully aware of the creation of jobs in North America. That is why we have committed in this summit to take on actions that would help us strengthen our economic ties even further. We have committed to enable trade, to have better infrastructure, to have safer exchanges, and to make our trade be easier. So these are the agreements that we have made today.
And we have also acknowledged the enormous potential. And the future that we see in the horizon would be based on the strengths that we have built upon over the course of the last 20 years. And let us acknowledge that we are three countries that we are like minded in terms of our values. We are three democratic countries. We are three countries who believe in free trade. And our countries have found in this instrument a space to create jobs and to have more development in our nations.
President Obama. Well, as we've said, I think, throughout our meetings today, America's success, Mexico's success, Canadian success are all bound together. I think that if you just look at the facts, Mexico has made enormous strides over the last several decades. And in part, that is because we've seen a greater integration of Mexico in the world economy. I think the United States and Canada have played constructive roles in that. Our ability to trade and engage in commerce with Mexico obviously has created jobs and opportunities in our country as well. And so it's been a mutually beneficial partnership, based on self-interest, but also, as Enrique said, based on common values.
I think we've seen a consolidation of democracy here in Mexico, and I think the kinds of reforms that Enrique has initiated over the last 13 months are ones that will put Mexico in an even stronger competitive footing in the world economy in the years to come.
And I recognize there are still implementation issues that will be involved and there will be a healthy debate here in Mexico, but I'm confident, given the talent of the Mexican people, given the resources of the Mexican people, given the growing capacity of Mexican businesses, and given the fact that we, as a North American entity, constitutes a huge trading bloc and economic powerhouse around the world, that we should anticipate Mexico's growth to continue, standards of living to continue, jobs and opportunities to continue. And that's what we hope for all our countries.
I'm confident that the partnership that we've developed is good for the United States, creates jobs in the United States, helps businesses in the United States. And if we continue to cooperate and try to reduce some of the barriers that have in the past slowed down our commercial exchanges, as well as educational exchanges and scientific exchanges, then we're going to be successful.
[Prime Minister Harper spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Prime Minister Harper. Allow me, this is our perspective. While Canada has seen great success, but the development of Mexico throughout this time period that is 20 years has been unbelievable: socially, economically, politically. And Mexico is becoming a world power. And we see this accelerating process with the support of President Peña Nieto.
We—you have made comments on the challenges to meet. I think that the greatest one is the need to keep on increasing the flow of goods and services and information across our borders at a time where risks and threats to security are also increased across the borders. And that will be the greatest challenge to meet.
[Prime Minister Harper repeated his remarks in English as follows.]
Look, I think the NAFTA relationship, as I've said before, has been tremendously successful for all of us. But I think, looking back 20 years, the development of Mexico on all levels—economic, social, and political—over the period has been incredible. It's a process that is accelerating under President Peña Nieto's very bold vision for the future, and Mexico is increasingly becoming a global economic player.
You asked about challenges. I think the biggest single challenge is in an era where we are seeing and need to see even greater movement of goods, services, people, investments, information flows across our borders, that at the same time, the risks and the threats to security across those borders continue to rise. So the big challenge will be how we continue to grow that human and trade flow, while at the same time minimizing the risks.
Moderator. President Peña Nieto, would you like to take the floor so you can officially close this meeting?
President Peña Nieto. Yes, I will. Thank you very much.
Once again, I would like to congratulate myself for this summit. We have built a climate that is based on trust, respect, and we have worked towards a relationship that it's very clear in terms of the responsibilities of each one of the heads of state. And I am certain that this relationship will result in a greater integration, a stronger friendship, and whatever we do for the sake of North America will benefit our peoples.
I would like to bear a testimony of how grateful I am towards the authorities of the State, the Governor of the State of Mexico, Eruviel Ávila. I'd like to thank you for enabling the summit to take place here. I would like to thank the Chief Justice of the State of Mexico. They provided us with their facilities.
And I would like to thank the inhabitants of the capital city of the State of Mexico, Toluca, for their hospitality. I thank them. And I'd like to thank all of them for the inconveniences in all the preparation work and all the security operations needed for this summit. I'm very grateful towards them. And I'm very grateful for the hospitality given to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, and the Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper.
Thank you very much, and have a safe trip home. Thank you very much."
"November 22, 2015","The President's News Conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Barack Obama,"Barack Obama, The President's News Conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/311527",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-kuala-lumpur-malaysia,"The President. Good afternoon, everybody. Let me begin by once again thanking the Government and the people of Malaysia for hosting us at the U.S.-ASEAN and East Asia Summits. These gatherings are enormous undertakings, but thanks to Malaysia's leadership and incredible hospitality, they have been a great success.
Earlier this week, as I headed to this region, there was a headline in one of our publications back home that asked: ""Obama's Asian Distraction?""—question mark. And the premise seemed to be that this region was somehow disconnected from pressing global events. I could not disagree more. This region is not a distraction from the world's central challenges, like terrorism. The Asia-Pacific is absolutely critical to promoting security, prosperity, and human dignity around the world. That's why I've devoted so much of my foreign policy to deepening America's engagement with this region. And I'm pleased that on this trip we made progress across the board.
With my fellow leaders from Japan, Australia, and the Philippines, I reaffirmed that our treaty alliances remain the foundation of regional security. The United States is boosting our support for the Philippines' maritime capabilities and those of our regional partners. At the U.S.-ASEAN and East Asia Summits, a key topic was the South China Sea, and many leaders spoke about the need to uphold international principles, including the freedom of navigation and overflight and the peaceful resolution of disputes. And to make sure we keep deepening our partnership here in Southeast Asia, I invited all 10 ASEAN leaders to the United States next year. I'm pleased they accepted, and I look forward to continuing our work.
On the economic front, we worked with our APEC partners to advance a regional economic order where all nations play by the same set of rules. Based on my meeting with our Trans-Pacific Partnership countries, I am optimistic that our 12 nations will approve this pact and that we can increasingly focus on implementing it.
APEC joined the G-20 in sending an unequivocal message that we need to reach an ambitious climate change agreement in Paris. I also want to note the landmark step we took this week with more than 30 other nations at the OECD to dramatically reduce subsidies for coal-fired power plants around the world, which is an important way to advance the fight against climate change.
Of course, given the events of this week, much of my work here in Asia focused on the urgent threat of terrorism. Today, families in too many nations are grieving the senseless loss of their loved ones in the attacks in France and in Mali. As Americans, we remember Nohemi Gonzalez, who was just 23 years old, a design major from California State University. She was in Paris to pursue her dream of designing innovations that would improve the lives of people around the world. And we remember Anita Datar of Maryland. She's a veteran of the Peace Corps, a mother to her young son, who devoted her life to helping the world's poor, including women and girls in Mali, and lift themselves up with health and education.
Nohemi and Anita embodied the values of service and compassion that no terrorist can extinguish. Their legacy will endure in the family and friends who carry on their work. They remind me of my daughters or my mother, who, on the one hand, had their whole life ahead of them, and on the other hand, had devoted their lives to helping other people. And it is worth us remembering when we look at the statistics that there are beautiful, wonderful lives behind the terrible death tolls that we see in these places.
Now, over the years, our friends here in Asia have been victims of terrorism, and many of them are close counterterrorism partners with us. So my time here has also been an opportunity to work with many of our partners in the Asia-Pacific that are members of our coalition against ISIL: Australia, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan.
Which brings me to the point I want to emphasize today. For more than a year, the United States has built and led a broad coalition against ISIL of some 65 nations. Given the frequent focus on America's leadership of this campaign, sometimes, the contributions of our partners are overlooked. In fact, since the G-20, a number of our coalition members have stepped up with new commitments. So today I want to take a moment to recognize how our allies and partners help advance every element of our strategy.
Nearly two dozen nations—among them Turkey and our Arab partners—contribute in some way to the military campaign, which has taken more than 8,000 strikes against ISIL so far. And as I've said, we're ready to welcome or cooperate with other countries that are determined to truly fight ISIL as well. Fifteen countries have deployed personnel to train and support local forces in Iraq. The United Arab Emirates and Germany are organizing 25 coalition partners in helping to stabilize areas in Iraq liberated from ISIL. Italy is coordinating the multinational effort to train Iraqi police.
On the political front, U.S. leadership brought all the key countries together in Vienna to discuss a common understanding on the principles for ending the Syrian civil war. On the humanitarian front, the United States is helping to lead the effort to mobilize more aid for the Syrian people, including refugees.
More than 40 countries have now passed or strengthened laws to prevent the flow of foreign terrorist fighters, and 34 nations, including the United States, have arrested foreign terrorist fighters. Saudi Arabia is helping to coordinate the crackdown on ISIL financing. The United Arab Emirates' new messaging center is working to discredit ISIL's propaganda, and Malaysia just announced the creation of its own center to do the same. And by joining our summit at the United Nations that we organized this fall, more than 100 nations, more than 20 multilateral institutions, and some 120 civil society groups—including many leaders from Muslim communities around the world—have become part of a global movement against ISIL and its twisted ideology.
All of which is to say that our coalition will not relent. We will not accept the idea that terrorist assaults on restaurants and theaters and hotels are the new normal or that we are powerless to stop them. After all, that's precisely what terrorists like ISIL want, because, ultimately, that's the only way that they can win. That's the nature of terrorism: They can't beat us on the battlefield, so they try to terrorize us into being afraid, into changing our patterns of behavior, into panicking, into abandoning our allies and partners, into retreating from the world. And as President, I will not let that happen.
In our diverse societies, everybody can do their part. And we will not give in to fear or start turning on each other or treating some people differently because of religion or race or background. That wouldn't just be a betrayal of our values, it would also feed ISIL's propaganda: their assertion—which is absolutely false, that we must absolutely reject—that we are somehow at war with an entire religion. The United States could never be at war with any religion because America is made up of multiple religions. We're strengthened by people from every religion, including Muslim Americans.
So I want to be as clear as I can on this: Prejudice and discrimination helps ISIL and undermines our national security. And so, even as we destroy ISIL on the battlefield—and we will destroy them—we will take back land that they are currently in. We will cut off their financing. We will hunt down their leadership. We will dismantle their networks and their supply lines, and we will ultimately destroy them. Even as we are in the process of doing that, we want to make sure that we don't lose our own values and our own principles. And we can all do our part by upholding the values of tolerance and diversity and equality that help keep America strong.
The United States will continue to lead this global coalition. We are intensifying our strategy on all fronts, with local partners on the ground. We are going to keep on rolling back ISIL in Iraq and in Syria and take out more of their leaders and commanders so that they do not threaten us. And we will destroy this terrorist organization.
And we'll keep working with our allies and partners for the opportunity and justice that helps defeat violent extremism. We'll keep standing up for the human rights and dignity of all people, because that is contrary to what these terrorists believe. That's part of how we defeat them. And I'm confident we will succeed. The hateful vision of an organization like ISIL is no match for the strength of nations and people around the world who are united to live in security and peace and in harmony.
So with that, I'm going to take a couple of questions. We'll start with Angela Greiling-Keane of Bloomberg. Yes.
Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) Terrorist Organization/Russia/Syria
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You're scheduled to meet this week with President Hollande in Washington to talk about stepping up efforts against ISIL even further. Given that Russia would be part of the coalition that France proposes, have you seen any signs in the past couple days of Russia redirecting its military efforts in Syria to actually focus on ISIL? Are you—are there any circumstances that you could see President Asad remaining in power, even if only temporarily, if that's what it took to effectively have a broad alliance directed at ISIL?
And finally, as you've said, the U.S. won't work with Russia if their goal is to keep Asad in power. If that's the case, is defeating ISIL or destroying ISIL a realistic goal?
The President. Well, first of all, destroying ISIL is not only a realistic goal, we're going to get it done, and we're going to pursue it with every aspect of American power and with all the coalition partners that we've assembled. It's going to get done.
It will be helpful if Russia directs its focus on ISIL, and I do think that as a consequence of ISIL claiming responsibility for bringing down their plane, there is an increasing awareness on the part of President Putin that ISIL poses a greater threat to them than anything else in the region. The question at this point is whether they can make the strategic adjustment that allows them to be effective partners with us and the other 65 countries who are already part of the counter-ISIL campaign. And we don't know that yet.
So far, over the last several weeks, when they started taking strikes in Syria, their principal targets have been the moderate opposition that they felt threatened Asad. Their principal goal appeared to be—if you follow the strikes that they took—to fortify the position of the Asad regime. And that does not add to our efforts against ISIL. In some ways, it strengthens it, because ISIL is also fighting many of those groups that the Russians were hitting.
When we were in Turkey, I discussed with President Putin, in a brief pull-aside, his need to recognize that he needs to go after the people who killed Russian citizens. And those aren't the groups that they were currently hitting with strikes. So they're going to have to make an adjustment in terms of what they're prioritizing.
More broadly—I've said this before; I said it to President Putin 5 years ago, and I repeated it to him just a few days ago—the issue with Asad is not simply the way that he has treated his people. It's not just a human rights issue. It's not just a question of supporting somebody who has been ruthlessly dropping bombs on his own civilian populations. As a practical matter, it is not conceivable that Mr. Asad can regain legitimacy in a country in which a large majority of that country despises Asad and will not stop fighting so long as he's in power, which means that the civil war perpetuates itself.
And so the goal in Vienna is to see if—with all the countries around the table, including Saudi Arabia and Turkey and Iran and Russia, as well as the United States and other countries that have concerns about this—whether we can arrive at a political transition process that recognizes the need for a new government and can quell the fighting, bring about a cease-fire, and allows all of us to refocus our attention on this barbaric organization that is killing so many people.
Russia has not officially committed to a transition of Asad moving out, but they did agree to the political transition process. And I think we'll find out over the next several weeks whether or not we can bring about that change of perspective with the Russians.
Keep in mind that we all have an interest in maintaining a Syrian state, because we don't want complete chaos. I mean, and there are problems that we've seen in, for example, Lebanon, when the machinery of state entirely breaks down. So there—there's going to be a need for the international community and the United Nations to work in order to maintain a Syria—maintaining a Syrian state and be able to move forward with a political transition that's orderly. And that's going to be difficult, but that's what we have to focus on.
In terms of the position of the United States and the other 65 members of the coalition, my view on Asad is, it will not work to keep him in power. We can't stop the fighting. Even if I were to cynically say that my priority is ISIL and not removing Asad regardless of the terrible things that he's done to his people, the United States could not stop the fighting in Syria by those who are opposed to Asad's rule. And so this is a practical issue, not just a matter of conscience. And I think that there are a large number of members of this coalition, including President Hollande, who agree with me on that. Okay?

Department of Defense Intelligence on the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) Terrorist Organization/U.N. Climate Change Conference/Terrorism
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. On a different topic, when you go to Paris next week for the climate talks, you do so in the shadow of what happened in that city a week ago. Could you talk a little bit about how you think those terror attacks might affect the talks? And substantively, on the talks, can you talk a little bit about concerns that the United States might not have the ability to convince poor countries that they will—that the nations will help them pay for what they need to do to achieve the climate talks, given especially the Republican opposition back home?
And on one separate matter, could you comment on the investigations that we reported about in our paper this morning into whether or not intelligence officials are altering the assessments of the ISIL campaign to make them seem more rosy?
The President. Okay. I'll take the last question first. One of the things I insisted on the day I walked into the Oval Office was that I don't want intelligence shaded by politics. I don't want it shaded by the desire to tell a feel-good story. We can't make good policy unless we've got good, accurate, hard-headed, clear-eyed intelligence. I believe that the Department of Defense and all those who head up our intelligence agencies understand that and that I have made it repeatedly clear to all my top national security advisers that I never want them to hold back, even if the intelligence or their opinions about the intelligence, their analysis or interpretations of the data, contradict current policy. So that's a message that we've been adamant about from the start.
I don't know what we'll discover with respect to what was going on at CENTCOM. I think that's something that's best left to the IG and the processes. I have communicated once again to both the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs as well as Secretary Carter that I expect that we get to the bottom of whether or not what you describe has been happening.
There are always going to be some disputes with respect to how to interpret facts on the ground. I get intelligence briefings every single day, and there are times where they're making their best judgments. They're—they'll say, with moderate confidence or low confidence or high confidence, this is what we think is happening. There may be times where there are disputes internally among various intelligence agencies about that. But I don't know the details of this. What I do know is my expectation, which is the highest fidelity to facts, data, the truth.
And if there are disagreements in terms of how folks are interpreting the facts, then that should be reflected in the reports that we receive: that some folks think this is going on; other folks thinks that's going on. And that's part of what I weigh in terms of making decisions.
One last thing I'll say though: As a consumer of this intelligence, it's not as if I've been receiving wonderfully rosy, glowing portraits of what's been happening in Iraq and Syria over the last year and a half. So to the extent that it's been shaded—again, I don't know the details of what's—the IG may discover—but it feels to me like, at my level at least, we've had a pretty clear-eyed, sober assessment of where we've made real progress and where we have not.
On Paris, a lot of the discussion out here both at the G-20, APEC, and finally here at ASEAN, has been that we've got to get a strong Paris deal. And I'm optimistic that we can. A hundred and sixty countries have now put forward their national targets for how they can reduce emissions; that accounts for about 90 percent of the world's emitters.
And the key to a strong agreement is going to be that, although there's going to be differentiation between countries—the United States doesn't expect that our obligations are identical to Laos, for example, given our levels of development, how much carbon we emit compared to theirs—that everybody does have a plan, that everybody is accountable to a single set of reporting requirements, that there's transparency about what each country is doing, that once we've set that architecture in place, in 5 years' time, we can review what we've done, turn up the dials in light of additional information and additional technology. In some cases, we may make progress faster than we expected, and we can increase our targets. So the key is to make sure that everybody is doing their part. You raise one important issue, and that is climate finance. There are going to be a number of countries who recognize the threat of climate change, want to do something about it, but they also have large populations suffering from extreme poverty, who don't have electricity, who don't have the ability to feed their families. And any leader of those countries has to ask themselves, am I going to be sacrificing development and poverty alleviation in order to deal with climate change, particularly since a lot of more developed countries are responsible for at least the current carbon emissions that are causing climate change?
And so the answer to that, we all—we've all agreed, is a finance mechanism to help these countries adapt—in some cases, leapfrog old technologies so that instead of building old, dirty power plants, here are some smart, clean energy plants. And we'll help you through technology transfer and financing so that you can achieve your development goals, but not add to the carbon problem.
So far, with a target of $100 billion, we've reached between private and public sources $62 billion, and that target did not need to be met until 2020, based on our original commitments. So we're all on—we're well on our way to meeting these commitments. And it's a smart investment for us to make.
Sometimes, back home, critics will argue, there's no point in us doing something about getting our house in order when it comes to climate change because other countries won't do anything and it will just mean that we're in a less competitive position. Well, when I met with President Xi and China signed on to an aggressive commitment, that took a major argument away from those critics. We now have the two largest emitters signed on. And it makes sense for us and the Chinese and the Europeans and others to help these countries, because, ultimately, if a country like India, for example, with over a billion people, is a major polluter, that's going to affect all of us. If on the other hand, they're developing and growing in a clean way, that's going to be good for all of us. All right?
I guess you wanted to know how the atmosphere, as a consequence of the attack in Paris, would affect it. Look, I think it is absolutely vital for every country, every leader to send a signal that the viciousness of a handful of killers does not stop the world from doing vital business, and that Paris—one of the most beautiful, enticing cities in the world—is not going to be cowered by the violent, demented actions of a few.
And that—that's part of the overall message that I want to very clearly send the American people. We do not succumb to fear. That's the primary power that these terrorists have over us. They cannot strike a mortal blow against the United States or against France or against a country like Malaysia. But they can make people fearful. And that's understandable, because that could have been us, that could have been our families, that could have been our children in these places. And our hearts are broken when we see these images.
But in addition to hunting down terrorists, in addition to effective intelligence, and in addition to missile strikes, and in addition to cutting off financing and all the other things that we're doing, the most powerful tool we have to fight ISIL is to say that we're not afraid; to not elevate them, to somehow buy into their fantasy that they're doing something important. They're a bunch of killers. And there have been people throughout human history who can find an excuse to kill people because they don't think like them or look like them. And we fight them, and we beat them, and we don't change our institutions and our culture and our values because of them. I want to be very clear about this. I am not afraid that ISIL will beat us because of their operations. When I see a headline that says this individual who designed this plot in Paris is a mastermind—he's not a mastermind, it's a—he found a few other vicious people, got hands on some fairly conventional weapons, and sadly, it turns out that if you're willing to die, you can kill a lot of people.
And so it is in our capacity to roll up those networks. Now, we've got to take precautions, we have to take it seriously, and we have to go at the heart of the problem that exists inside of Syria and Iraq right now. And we have to address the broader issues that exist in a tiny fraction of the Muslim community. But it is a real problem that leaders from Prime Minister Najib to the President of Indonesia and others who have large Muslim populations acknowledge. A country like Indonesia has 250 million people; if just a tiny fraction of those are in some ways attracted by a vicious ideology like ISIL's, then that's a real problem for us. And so tools like countering this narrative and Muslim clerics and political leaders and community leaders coming forward and making sure that our children are not being fed this kind of bile, that's critically important as well.
But in all of this, we cannot respond from fear. And the American people, in the past, have confronted some very real, enormous threats, and we beat them. We vanquished them. This will be no different.

U.S. Military's Rules of Engagement in Counter-ISIL Campaign/Immigration Reform/Sex Trafficking
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you about what Secretary Carter said about expanding the rules of engagement versus ISIS. What was that conversation like? And what did he mean by that?
And I'd like to ask you also about immigration. The High Court is looking into executive action on immigration, as you know. And I understand the sensitivity of it; you don't want to be prejudicial. But I'm curious, are you where you thought you'd be in immigration reform? And what would you say to family members who say: ""Listen, we did it the right way, we've waited our turn in line. How do these other guys get to skip the line, if you will?""
And lastly, the Attorney General announced eight indictments of individuals in the U.S. and Mexico on sex trafficking and related charges. Where is the fight against sex trafficking among the priorities for your administration? Are you where you thought you'd be on that?
Thank you, sir.
The President. Okay. Kevin, you asked all those questions so nicely, but if everybody is asking three questions, we're not going to get home. [Laughter] So let me see if I can go through these very quickly.
With respect to rules of engagement, we are in a constant conversation inside the Situation Room about how do we apply force most effectively to go after key ISIL targets, key ISIL leaders, strategic positions, their infrastructure, their supply lines, while minimizing civilian casualties. We do so for two reasons. One, because it's the right thing to do. There are people who are caught up in Mosul right now, for example, who despise ISIL, who are essentially captive to ISIL, are being brutalized by ISIL. And to the extent that we can avoid them being killed by those of us who are trying to defeat ISIL, that's a legitimate concern in any military campaign. Because if we're not careful about it—and this brings us to the practical element of it—then you can alienate the very populations that you need to win over, because ultimately, those are the folks who are going to have to drive ISIL out, stomp it out all the way.
The good news is, is the U.S. military has become very good at this. I think that there have been some circumstances where the military proceeds in steps and are continually reevaluating whether, well, maybe this is a situation where we can, in fact, take the strike without a lot of civilian casualties.
A good example with the recent trucks that were struck. There may be ways in which warnings can be given to the drivers—many of whom may not work for ISIL, they may just be for hire or being forced into it—so that they'd better abandon those trucks before we shoot them down, because we're shooting them down. So that's the kind of conversation, and that's been ongoing throughout the process.
With respect to immigration reform, I can't comment on the ins and outs of the legal case. I've said before, and I'll say again: I am confident that the rules and executive action that I put forward are squarely within the category of prosecutorial discretion that historically has been under a President's power. And you've got lower courts who have disagreed, but we think that past precedent is on our side.
Substantively, I've got 11 million people in our countries, many of whom are working, paying taxes, our neighbors, coworkers, friends who have lived here for a very long—who have lived in the United States for a very long time. We're not going to deport them, despite what some political leaders may say. It would be contrary to who we are, would be too costly, is too impractical. What we want to do is allow them to get out of the shadows and to get right with the law, pay a fine, go to the back of the line, but hopefully, over time, be contributors to society.
Of course, none of this would be necessary if we just passed the legislation that was passed in the Senate with a bipartisan majority. And I continue to believe that the ultimate solution is going to be one that comes from Congress. And although, during this political season, it may be difficult for Republican leaders in either the House or in the Senate to resuscitate that legislation, my hope is, is that after the election, they will. And in the interim, I'm going to do everything I can to sensibly apply our immigration laws in a way that is reflective of the fact that we're a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.
And just very briefly, with respect to sex trafficking: This is a critical problem; we take it very seriously. We have entire divisions in our law enforcement agencies that are dedicated to this. I've elevated this within the White House so that we have people focusing specifically on ending trafficking. And in our international discussions—most specifically, out here in Southeast Asia—we are working very closely to promote mechanisms that will end trafficking.
In fact, TPP, one of the central mechanisms in TPP, to ensure high labor standards and human rights and human dignity, are requirements among the members who are signatories to have in place real, serious, enforceable ways to prevent the kind of human trafficking that causes such hardship and brutality for so many people.
And those of you who were with me when I visited the refugee center yesterday will recall the lovely young 16-year-old who was sitting next to me. She's somebody who had been victim of trafficking. And it reminds you of the terrible toll that is often placed on children, people who are the most vulnerable, people who are least able to protect themselves. And every country has an obligation to put an end to it. Dave Nakamura [Washington Post].
Terrorism
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You said moments ago that Americans should not give in to fear when it comes to these terrorist attacks. But you also said that the person who may have been the person behind thinking about the attacks is not a mastermind and that anybody who can get their hands on some conventional weapons can—and is willing to die can blow themselves up. How should Americans feel, then, if they shouldn't be scared?
And if I may, the Washington Post and ABC News just this week came out with a poll that said 83 percent of the voting public believes that an attack, a terrorist attack on—against the U.S. with m","ass casualties is likely to happen in the near future, and 40 percent say it's very likely. Does that in your mind—given the fact that you think the public should not be so fearful—mean that the terrorists are winning? And do you believe that this is sort of the new normal and Americans will have to live with this kind of fear?
The President. David, I think that the American people are in—are right to be concerned, and to expect that we in the Government and in law enforcement are doing everything we can to disrupt terrorist attacks, to intercept intelligence that may lead us to individuals who are willing to carry out these attacks, that we make sure that these terrorists are not gaining the kinds of weaponry that would make it easier for them to cause mass attacks. This is a serious problem. And as somebody who, more often than I would like, have met with or comforted families of victims of terrorism, the losses are real, and they're devastating. So this is a serious problem. And we have to work collectively across the board, as we've been doing since I became President and since previous administrations identified the kinds of organized terrorist activity like Al Qaida that we've seen—we've got to do everything we can to stop it.
But there is a difference between being vigilant and being concerned and taking this seriously and taking precautions and, in some cases, changing our security arrangements, as we've done, for example, in aviation. There's a difference between smart applications of law enforcement and military and intelligence and succumbing to the kind of fear that leads us to abandon our values, to abandon how we live, to abandon—or change how we treat each other.
And the good news is, there, Americans actually have been resilient. They've been tested. We had a mass casualty attack on 9/11. And as I said before, I was very proud of the fact that the fundamental nature of America and how we treated each other did not change.
I think we made some bad decisions subsequent to that attack in part based on fear, and that's why we have to be cautious about it. We have to think things through. But overall, the American people went about their lives. Times Square is filled with people—rightly so. After the Boston bombing attack, folks went right back to the ballpark and sang, ""Take Me Out to the Ballgame."" That's what they needed to do.
And so the message I have is that those of us who are charged with protecting the American people are going to do everything we can to destroy this particular network. Once this network is destroyed—and it will be—there may be others that pop up in different parts of the world, and so we're going to have to continue to take seriously how we maintain the infrastructure that we've built to prevent this. But it doesn't have to change the fundamental trajectory of the American people. And that we should feel confident about.
And the media needs to help in this. I mean, I just want to say, I—during the course of this week, a very difficult week, it is understandable that this has been a primary focus. But one of the things that has to happen is, how we report on this has to maintain perspective and not empower in any way these terrorist organizations or elevate them in ways that make it easier for them to recruit or make them stronger.
They're a bunch of killers with good social media. And they are dangerous, and they've caused great hardship to people. But the overwhelming majority of people who go about their business every day, the Americans who are building things and making things and teaching and saving lives as firefighters and as police officers and—they're stronger. Our way of life is stronger. We have more to offer. We represent 99.9 percent of humanity. And that's why we should be confident that we'll win.

U.S. Policy on Refugees/Prime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia/Transparency and Accountability in Government
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You've threatened to veto the bill the House passed that would tighten screening procedures for Syrian refugees, but you've left the door open to more—legislation that is more constructive in the White House's view.
The President. Yes.
Q. What specific changes to your refugee program would you support? And do you think that Democrats who are calling for a halt to your program are betraying our country's values, as you've suggested of some Republicans?
And one last thing—I'm sorry—separately. [Laughter] Not a four-part question.
The President. Just a two-parter.
Q. Right.
The President. Okay, go ahead.
Q. You met Friday with Prime Minister Najib, who is facing allegations of corruption and human rights violations. And you'd said at your town hall event that you would raise those issues with him when you spoke privately. What was your message to Najib about the investments funds scandal and also about the issue of jailing his political opponents?
The President. Okay. With respect to the refugee program, Paris just happened a week ago. News moves so fast these days that sometimes we just lose track. It's been so recent and so pervasive in the news, and people have, understandably, been so concerned given how similar Paris is to many American cities, that I get why legislation in the House moved forward quickly.
My hope, though, is, is that now that we've got some time to catch our breath and take a look at this carefully, people understand that refugees who end up in the United States are the most vetted, scrutinized, thoroughly investigated individuals that ever arrive on American shores; that the process that's been constructed over the course of several administrations on a bipartisan basis is extraordinarily thorough and currently takes between 18 to 24 months for somebody to be approved.
And so although, on its face, the House legislation simply says, well, we can just certify, and this isn't—not along the lines of some of the more radical proposals that we were hearing earlier in the week from some Presidential candidates—the fact of the matter is, is that if it gums up the works so much, then effectively, you don't end up seeing any refugees admitted. If you layer it with more and more bureaucracy that doesn't actually make us safer, because it doesn't do a better job of screening, but simply makes it almost impossible to process individuals who are coming in, then you're effectively ending the refugee program for people who desperately need it.
And when I referred to a betrayal of our values, I was being very specific about some of the commentary that was made that would suggest, for example, that we might let Christians in but not Muslims; that we—somehow we're so fearful that a 4-year-old orphan might not be let in. And those of you who joined me to the refugee center yesterday and you saw those kids, that's who we're talking about. If you are a parent and you saw those kids, and you thought about what they had gone through, the notion that we couldn't find a home for them anywhere in the United States of America, it—that is contrary to our values.
And the good news is, is that the overwhelming majority of the people who know that we are screening and all the precautions that are already taken, if they saw those kids, they'd say, yes, we need to do right by those children.
So with respect to Prime Minister Najib, I don't comment on investigations happening back in the United States; I certainly am not going to comment on any investigations or legal proceedings that may be taking place in a foreign country where I'm a visitor. But I did raise with Prime Minister Najib—as I have with many of the leaders here in Southeast Asia, but also many leaders in Africa and Latin America and everywhere we go—the importance of transparency, accountability, the importance of rooting out corruption, all of which are impediments to development, all of which hold countries back, all of which contribute to poverty and stunted growth.
And if countries solve those problems, even if they are resource poor and landlocked, they will do better. And if they don't solve those problems, it doesn't matter how much they're blessed by natural resources or size or geography, they're going to fail.
And I also emphasized to Prime Minister Najib the importance of civil society and a free press in countries thriving. And every country here is at different levels and stages of development, both social and economic, and we don't expect that everybody follows the same path that the United States does. But I do think there are some basic principles that are important for us to uphold as friends and partners to the countries that we're talking to.
The good news is, is that—take a country like Myanmar that just went through a historic election after having been subject for 40 years to military rule. They're not going to immediately be Sweden in terms of their democratic practices, but there is a sea change taking place there, and we want to encourage that and engage it.
And a lot of the work that we do—the Open Government Partnership that we set up through the United Nations, the bilateral work we do in terms of improving transparency, the principles and rules that we've embedded in TPP—all those things are designed to raise the bar, to have people set sights that are a little bit higher. And some will go forward, some will slip back. Paces will vary, but the trajectory is the same, and that is a world where ordinary people are treated fairly, there's rule of law, there's transparency, governments are accountable, people's voices are heard, women are treated equally, minorities are not discriminated against.
Those are profoundly American values, but I also think they are universal values.
All right. Thank you, everybody. Let's go home."
"April 22, 2016","The President's News Conference With Prime Minister David W.D. Cameron of the United Kingdom in London, England",Barack Obama,"Barack Obama, The President's News Conference With Prime Minister David W.D. Cameron of the United Kingdom in London, England Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/318155",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-david-wd-cameron-the-united-kingdom,"Prime Minister Cameron. Well, good afternoon, and welcome. It's great to welcome President Obama again, on his fifth visit to the United Kingdom.
Barack has been President for more than 7 years; I've been Prime Minister for nearly 6 years. And our two countries have been working together through some of the most difficult and troubled global times. We faced the aftermath of the banking crisis, the need to revive growth and create jobs in our economies, new threats to our security from Russia in the east to the rise of Islamist terrorism in the south, and of course, huge global challenges like Ebola and climate change. And through it all, the strong and essential partnership between our nations has never been more important.
When, 70 years ago last month, Winston Churchill first described the special relationship, it was not merely an enduring expression of friendship, it was a way of working together. It was about two nations, kindred spirits who share the same values and, so often, the same approaches to the many issues that we face.
And just as for our predecessors, that has been true for Barack and me, whether we're working to deliver economic security, national security, or new, emerging challenges. And today we've been discussing all three.
On economic security, we've succeeded in getting our economies growing and creating jobs for our people. The global economy still faces serious challenges, but last year, Britain and the United States were the two fastest growing major economies in the world.
And we both know just how important trade deals are in driving global growth. So Barack and I remain among the most determined to achieve our vision of a U.S.-EU trade deal. And we're working hard to push this forward because it would add billions to our economies and set the standards for the rest of the world to follow.
On national security, together with our partners in the EU, we've used our economic muscle to avoid the calamity of an Iranian nuclear weapon. We've delivered sanctions against Russia in response to its aggression against Ukraine. We've secured the first-ever global and legally binding deal on climate change, being formally signed today by over 150 governments at the United Nations.
And we've transformed the way that we use our aid, our diplomacy, and our military together to make progress on some of the most difficult issues of our time. For example, in East Africa, we've helped to turn around the prospects for Somalia. For instance, thanks to an EU operation, led by Britain, supported by America, its waters are no longer a safe haven for pirates. And in West Africa, British leadership in Europe secured a billion euros to support our efforts in helping the people of the region to defeat the outbreak of Ebola, with Britain taking the lead in Sierra Leone, the United States in Liberia, France in Guinea.
But just as we've made important progress in all these areas, so there are many more that need a lot more work. There's no doubt that the situation in Libya is immensely challenging, but we now finally have a Government of National Accord with whom we can work, while in Syria and Iraq, we are continuing coalition efforts to defeat and degrade Daesh.
More than 25,000 Daesh fighters have now been killed, over 600 in the last month alone, with the total number of Daesh fighters now estimated to be at its lowest for about 2 years. The Iraqi security forces are steadily pushing Daesh out of its territory, this week almost entirely clearing them out of the town of Hit. And in Syria, our partners have liberated the large Kurdish areas in the northeast and cut off the main route between Raqqa and Mosul.
We also discussed efforts to deal with the migration crisis. This doesn't directly affect the United States, and in the U.K., we've maintained our borders, and we will continue to do so. But we both know the challenge this poses to our friends and our allies and to the continent of Europe. This is the sort of challenge that can only be tackled effectively through international cooperation. NATO is helping to reduce the number of migrants in the Eastern Mediterranean. And Barack and I have discussed how NATO might now contribute to the EU's efforts in the Central Mediterranean too.
We also need to do more to break the business model of the people smugglers, so, together with our EU partners and the Libyan Government, we'll look at whether there's more we can do to strength the Libyan Coast Guard. Barack and I will be discussing this further when we meet with the leaders of France, Germany, and Italy in Hannover on Monday. And this will be another opportunity to show that—how, working together, collectively, we can better protect ourselves from the threats that we face.
We also covered a number of new and emerging challenges where it will be more important than ever that we work together with our own international partners to identify problems and deal with them rapidly. Just as we've done with Ebola, we now need the same international cooperation on dealing with the Zika virus, on the challenge of antimicrobial resistance, on cybersecurity, and on tackling corruption.
Britain is holding a big anticorruption summit here in London next month, which Secretary Kerry will attend. And Barack and I have talked today about some of the things we wanted to achieve. One of the biggest problems is that if you're a country that wants to take action against corruption you have to go all around the globe to lobby for help. So we'd like to see an international anticorruption coordination center to help law enforcement agencies and investigators work together right across different jurisdictions. And if we get international agreement on this next month, both Britain and America will help contribute to set it up.
All this work we have done together, and at the same time, I think we've got to know each other very well. I'm honored to have Barack as a friend. He's taught me the rules of basketball. He's beaten me at table tennis. [Laughter] I remember very fondly the barbecue we had in Number 10 Downing Street, serving service men and women who serve our countries and serve our countries together here in the United Kingdom. I've always found Barack someone who gives sage advice. He's a man with a very good heart, and been a very good friend, and always will be a good friend, I know, to the United Kingdom.
Let me finish by saying this. In all the areas we've discussed today, our collective power and reach is amplified by Britain's membership of the European Union. Let me be clear. When it comes to the special relationship between our two countries, there's no greater enthusiast than me. I'm very proud to have the opportunity to be Prime Minister and to stand outside the White House, listening to this man, my friend, Barack, say that the special relationship between our countries has never been stronger. But I've never felt constrained in any way in strengthening this relationship by the fact that we're in the European Union.
In fact, quite the reverse. We deliver for our people through all the international groups that we're part of. We enhance our security through the membership of NATO. We further our prosperity through the G-7 and the G-20. And like those organizations, Britain's membership of the EU gives us a powerful tool to deliver on the prosperity and security that our people need and to stand up for the values that our countries share. And now, I think, is a time to stay true to those values and to stick together with our friends and allies in Europe and around the world.
Thank you very much.
Barack.
President Obama. Thank you, David. And as always, it is wonderful to be here in London and to meet with my good friend David Cameron. I confess I've also come back to wish Her Majesty the Queen a very happy 90th birthday. Earlier today Michelle and I had the honor to join Her Majesty and His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh as their guests at Windsor Castle, where we conveyed the good wishes of the American people.
I have to say, I have never been driven by a Duke of Edinburgh before. [Laughter] And I can report that it was very smooth riding. As for Her Majesty, the Queen has been a source of inspiration for me, like so many people around the world. She is truly one of my favorite people. And should we be fortunate enough to reach 90, may we be as vibrant as she is. She's an astonishing person and a real jewel to the world and not just to the United Kingdom.
The alliance between the United States and the United Kingdom is one of the oldest and one of the strongest that the world has ever known. When the U.S. and the U.K. stand together, we make our countries more secure, we make our people more prosperous, and we make the world safer and better.
That's one of the reasons why my first overseas visit as President more than 7 years ago was here to London, at a time of global crisis. And the one thing I knew, as green as I was as a new President, was that it was absolutely vital that the United States and the United Kingdom, working together in an international forum, tackle the challenges that lie ahead. Our success depended on our ability to coordinate and to be able to leverage our relationship to have an impact on other countries.
I met with David on that visit. He wasn't yet Prime Minister. But just as our nations share a special relationship, David and I have shared an extraordinary partnership. He has proven to be a great friend and is one of my closest and most trusted partners. Over the 6 years or so that our terms have overlapped, we have met or spoken more times than I can count. We've shared our countries' beers with each other—he vouches for his, I vouch for mine—[laughter]—taken in a basketball game in America.
David, I think you should recall, we were actually partners in that ping-pong game. [Laughter] And we lost to some schoolchildren.
Prime Minister Cameron. Yes. [Laughter]
President Obama. I can't remember whether they were 8 or 10, but they were decidedly shorter than we were, and they whooped us. [Laughter] Samantha and Michelle, our better halves, have become good friends as well. And it's the depth and the breadth of that special relationship that has helped us tackle some of the most daunting challenges of our time.
Around the world, our joint efforts, as David mentioned, have stopped the outbreak of Ebola, helped Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, forged a climate agreement in Paris that, hopefully, will help to protect our planet for future generations.
And today, on Earth Day, our governments, along with about 170 others, are in New York to sign that agreement. And the U.S. is committed to formally joining it this year, which should help it take effect years earlier than anybody expected.
We also discussed the full array of challenges to our shared security. We remain resolute in our efforts to prevent terrorist attacks against our people and to continue the progress that we've made in rolling back and ultimately defeating ISIL. Our forces, as David mentioned, are systematically degrading ISIL's finances and safe havens and removing its top leaders from the battlefield. And we've got to keep working to improve security and information sharing across Europe and to stem the flow of foreign fighters into and out of Syria.
We discussed our efforts to resolve political conflicts in the Middle East, from Yemen to Syria to Libya, in order to increase the prospects for stability. In Libya, going forward, we have an opportunity to support a new Government and help Libyans root out extremist elements. In Syria, as challenging as it is, we still need to see more progress towards an enduring cease-fire, and we continue to push for greater humanitarian access to the people who need it most.
We have to continue to invest in NATO so that we can meet our overseas commitments, from Afghanistan to the Aegean. We have to resolve the conflict in the Ukraine and reassure allies who are rightly concerned about Russian aggression. All NATO allies should aim for the NATO target of spending 2 percent of their GDP on defense, something that David has made sure happens here in the U.K. to meet that standard.
We discussed new actions we can take to address the refugee crisis, including with our NATO allies. And because a strong defense relies on more than just military spending, but on helping to unleash the potential of others to live freer and more prosperous lives, I want to thank the people of the United Kingdom for their extraordinary generosity as one of the world's foremost donors of humanitarian aid.
We talked about promoting jobs and stronger growth through increased transatlantic trade and investment so that our young people can achieve greater opportunity and prosperity. And yes, the Prime Minister and I discussed the upcoming referendum here on whether or not the U.K. should remain part of the European Union.
Let me be clear: Ultimately, this is something that the British voters have to decide for themselves. But as part of our special relationship, part of being friends is to be honest and to let you know what I think. And speaking honestly, the outcome of that decision is a matter of deep interest to the United States because it affects our prospects as well. The United States wants a strong United Kingdom as a partner. And the United Kingdom is at its best when it's helping to lead a strong Europe. It leverages U.K. power to be part of the European Union.
As I wrote in the op-ed here today, I don't believe the EU moderates British influence in the world, it magnifies it. The EU has helped to spread British values and practices across the continent. The single market brings extraordinary economic benefits to the United Kingdom. And that ends up being good for America, because we're more prosperous when one of our best friends and closest allies has a strong, stable, growing economy. Americans want Britain's influence to grow, including within Europe.
The fact is, in today's world, no nation is immune to the challenges that David and I just discussed. And in today's world, solving them requires collective action. All of us cherish our sovereignty—my country is pretty vocal about that—but the U.S. also recognizes that we strengthen our security through our membership in NATO. We strengthen our prosperity through organizations like the G-7 and the G-20. And I believe the U.K. strengthens both our collective security and prosperity through the EU.
In the 21st century, the nations that make their presence felt on the world stage aren't the nations that go it alone, but the nations that team up to aggregate their power and multiply their influence. And precisely because Britain's values and institutions are so strong and so sound, we want to make sure that that influence is heard, that it's felt, that it influences how other countries think about critical issues. We have confidence that when the U.K. is involved in a problem that they're going to help solve it in the right way. That's why the United States cares about this.
For centuries, Europe was marked by war and by violence. The architecture that our two countries helped build with the EU has provided the foundation for decades of relative peace and prosperity on that continent. What a remarkable legacy, a legacy born in part out of what took place in this building.
Before we walked out, I happened to see Enigma on display. And that was a reminder of the incredible innovation and collaboration of the allies in World War II and the fact that neither of us could have won that alone. And in the same way, after World War II, we built out the international institutions that, yes, occasionally constrained us, but we willingly allowed those constraints because we understood that by doing so, we were able to institutionalize and internationalize the basic values of rule of law and freedom and democracy that would benefit our citizens as well as people around the world.
I think there's a British poet who once said, ""No man is an island""—[laughter]—even an island as beautiful as this. We're stronger together. And if we continue to tackle our challenges together, then future generations will look back on ours, just as we look back on the previous generation of English and American citizens who worked so hard to make this world safer and more secure and more prosperous, and they'll say that we did our part. And that's important. That's important not just here; that's important in the United States as well.
Thanks.
Prime Minister Cameron. Thank you very much.
Right, we've got some questions. We're going to start with a question from the British press. We'll have Chris Ship from ITV.
United Kingdom's European Union Membership Referendum
Q. Thank you very much, Prime Minister. Chris Ship from ITV News.
Mr. President, you, yourself, acknowledge the controversial timing of your comments on the EU referendum and the spirited debate that we're having here. And I think you're right. In the weeks before your arrival here, Leave campaigners have said that you're acting hypocritically. America would not accept the loss of sovereignty that we have to accept as part of the EU. America would not accept the levels of immigration from Mexico that we have to accept from the EU. And therefore, in various degrees of politeness, they have said to you that you should really keep your views to yourself. [Laughter] With that in mind, Mr. President, do you still think it was the right decision to intervene in this debate? And can I ask you this: Crucially, what happens if the U.K. does decide in June to leave the European Union?
President Obama. Well, first of all, let me repeat: This is a decision for the people of the United Kingdom to make. I'm not coming here to fix any votes. I'm not casting a vote myself. I'm offering my opinion. And in democracies, you—everybody should want more information, not less. And you shouldn't be afraid to hear an argument being made. That's not a threat. That should enhance the debate.
Particularly, because my understanding is that some of the folks on the other side have been ascribing to the United States certain actions we'll take if the U.K. does leave the EU. So they say, for example, that, well, we'll just cut our own trade deals with the United States. So they're voicing an opinion about what the United States is going to do. I figured you might want to hear it from the President of the United States what I think the United States is going to do. [Laughter]
And on that matter, for example, I think it's fair to say that maybe some point down the line, there might be a U.K.-U.S. trade agreement, but it's not going to happen anytime soon, because our focus is in negotiating with a big bloc, the European Union, to get a trade agreement done, and the U.K. is going to be in the back of the queue, not because we don't have a special relationship, but because, given the heavy lift on any trade agreement, us having access to a big market with a lot of countries, rather than trying to do piecemeal trade agreements, is hugely inefficient.
Now, to the subject at hand, obviously, the United States is in a different hemisphere, different circumstances, has different sets of relationships with its neighbors than the U.K. does. But I can tell you this. If right now I've got access to a massive market where I sell 44 percent of my exports, and now I'm thinking about leaving the organization that gives me access to that market and that is responsible for millions of jobs in my country and responsible for an enormous amount of commerce and upon which a lot of businesses depend, that's not something I'd probably do.
And what I'm trying to describe is a broader principle, which is, in our own ways—I mean, we don't have a common market in the Americas—but in all sorts of ways, the United States constrains itself in order to bind everyone under a common set of norms and rules that makes everybody more prosperous.
That's what we built after World War II. The United States and the U.K. designed a set of institutions, whether it was the United Nations or the Bretton Woods structure, IMF, World Bank, NATO, across the board. Now, that, to some degree, constrained our freedom to operate. It meant that occasionally we had to deal with some bureaucracy. It meant that on occasion we have to persuade other countries and we don't get a hundred percent of what we want in each case. But we knew that by doing so, everybody was going to be better off, partly because the norms and rules that were put in place were reflective of what we believe. If there were more free markets around the world and an orderly financial system, we knew we could operate in that environment. If we had collective defense treaties through NATO, we understood that we could formalize an architecture that would deter aggression, rather than us having, piecemeal, to put together alliances to defeat aggression after it already started. And that principle is what's at stake here. And the last point I'll make on this—until I get the next question, I suspect—[laughter]—is that, as David said, this magnifies the power of the U.K. It doesn't diminish it. On just about every issue, what happens in Europe is going to have an impact here. And what happens in Europe is going to have an impact in the United States.
We just discussed, for example, the refugee and the migration crisis. And I've told my team—which is sitting right here, so they'll vouch for me—[laughter]—that we consider it a major national security issue that you have uncontrolled migration into Europe, not because these folks are coming to the United States, but because if it destabilizes Europe, our largest trading bloc—trading partner, it's going to be bad for our economy. If you start seeing divisions in Europe, that weakens NATO. That will have an impact on our collective security.
Now, if in fact I want somebody who's smart and common sense and tough and is thinking, as I do, in the conversations about how migration is going to be handled, somebody who also has a sense of compassion and recognizes that immigration can enhance, when done properly, the assets of a country, and not just diminish them, well, I want David Cameron in the conversation. Just as I want him in the conversation when we're having conversations—discussions about information sharing and counterterrorism activity. There—precisely because I have confidence in the U.K., and I know that if we're not working effectively with Paris or Brussels, then those attacks are going to migrate to the United States and to London, I want one of my strongest partners in that conversation. So it enhances the special relationship. It doesn't diminish it.
Prime Minister Cameron. Let me just make, Chris, one point in response to that. I mean, this is our choice, nobody else's; the sovereign choice of the British people. But as we make that choice, it surely makes sense to listen to what our friends think, to listen to their opinion, to listen to their views. And that's what Barack has been talking about today.
But it's also worth remembering as we make this choice, it's a British choice about the British membership of the European Union. We're not being asked to make a choice about whether we support the German style of membership or the Italian style of membership. Britain has a special status in the European Union. We're in the single market; we're not part of the single currency. We're able to travel and live and work in other European countries, but we've maintained our borders, because we're not in the Schengen no-border zone.
And on this vital issue of trade, where Barack has made such a clear statement, we should remember why we are currently negotiating this biggest trade deal in the whole world and in the whole world's history, between the European Union and the United States. It's because Britain played an absolutely leading part in pushing for those talks to get going. Indeed, we announced them at the G-8 in Northern Ireland, when Britain was in the chair of that organization. We set the agenda for what could be an absolutely game-changing trade deal for jobs, for investment, because we were part of this organization.
So I just want to add those important points.
I think we have a U.S. question now.
President Obama. Justin Sink [Bloomberg News].
European Migration Crisis/United Kingdom's European Union Membership Referendum/Libya
Q. Thanks, Mr. President. Following on that, do you think that between Brexit and the migration issue, European unity is at a crisis point? What do you hope leaders gathering in Germany can concretely do about it? And do you expect those nations to militarily support, including the possibility of ground troops, the new Government in Libya to keep that situation from further straining Europe? While we're talking about future summits, I'm also wondering if maybe you could talk about whether you plan to go to Hiroshima when you visit Japan. And——
President Obama. Oh, come on, man. You're really stretching it. [Laughter]
Q. This one is for Prime Minister Cameron, and it's short. I promise.
Prime Minister Cameron, the President has come here to tell the U.K. that, as a friend, and speaking honestly, that they should stay in the EU. As a friend and speaking honestly, what would you advise American voters to do about Donald Trump? Thanks. [Laughter]
President Obama. That was so predictable.
Prime Minister Cameron. I'll let you take the first six——
President Obama. Yes, exactly.
Prime Minister Cameron. ——and then, I'll pick up that last one. [Laughter]
President Obama. I wouldn't describe European unity as in a crisis, but I would say it is under strain. And some of that just has to do with the aftermath of the financial crisis and the strains that we're all aware of with respect to the euro zone. I think it is important to emphasize, as David points out, that the U.K. is not part of the euro zone, and so the blowback to the British economy has been different than it is on the continent. But we've seen some divisions and difficulties between the southern and the northern parts of Europe. That's created some strains.
I think the migration crisis amplifies a debate that's taking place not just in Europe, but in the United States as well. At a time of globalization, at a time when a lot of the challenges that we face are transnational, as opposed to just focused on one country, there is a temptation to want to just pull up the drawbridge, either literally or figuratively. We see that played out in some of the debates that are taking place in the U.S. Presidential race. And that debate, I think, is accelerated in Europe. But I'm confident that the ties that bind Europe together are ultimately much stronger than the forces that are trying to pull them apart.
Europe has undergone an extraordinary stretch of prosperity, maybe unmatched in the history of the world. And if you think about the 20th century and you think about the 21st century, 21st-century Europe looks an awful lot better. And I think the majority of Europeans recognize that. They see that unity and peace have delivered sustained economic growth, reduced conflict, reduced violence, enhanced the quality of life of people. And I'm confident that can continue.
But I do believe that it's important to watch out for some of these faultlines that are developing. And in that sense, I do think that the Brexit vote—which, if I'm a citizen of U.K., I'm thinking about it solely in terms of how is this helping me, how is this helping the U.K. economy, how is it helping create jobs here in the U.K.—that's the right way to think about it. But I do also think that this vote will send a signal that is relevant about whether the kind of prosperity that we've built together is going to continue or whether the forces of division end up being more prominent. And that's why it's—that's part of the reason why it's relevant to the United States and why I have had the temerity to weigh in on it. What were your four other questions? [Laughter] I've got to figure I've knocked out two through that answer.
Q. Libya.
President Obama. With respect to Libya, both David and I discussed our commitment to try to assist this nascent Government. And it's a challenge, but there are people in this Government of National Accord that are genuinely committed to building back up a state. That's something we desperately want, because both the United States and United Kingdom, but also a number of our other allies, are more than prepared to invest in helping create border security in Libya and helping to drive out terrorists inside of Libya and trying to make sure that what could be a thriving society—a relatively small population, a lot of resources—this is not an issue where we should have to subsidize Libya. They're actually much better positioned than some other countries that we've been helping, if they can just get their act together. And we want to help provide that technical assistance to get that done.
There is no plans for ground troops in Libya. I don't think that's necessary. I don't think it would be welcomed by this new Government. It would send the wrong signal. This is a matter of, can Libyans come together? What we can do is to provide them our expertise. What we can do is provide them training. What we can do is provide them a roadmap for how they can get basic services to their citizens and build up legitimacy.
But I do think that the one area where both David and I are heavily committed is, as this progresses, we can't wait if ISIL is starting to get a foothold there. And so we are working not just with the Libyan Government, but a lot of our international partners, to make sure that we're getting the intelligence that we need and, in some cases, taking actions to prevent ISIL from having another stronghold from which to launch attacks against Europe or ag","ainst the United States.
And I think you have to wait until I get to Asia to start asking me Asia questions. [Laughter]
Prime Minister Cameron. The question you asked me: This is not a general election. This is a referendum. And as Barack has explained, it's a referendum that affects, of course, the people of the United Kingdom very deeply, but it also does affect others in the European Union; it affects partners like America or Canada or Australia or New Zealand. And as I look around the world, it is hard to find—so far, I haven't found one—a country that wishes Britain well that thinks we ought to leave the European Union.
And I think that's—again, it's our choice. We'll make the decision. We'll listen to all the arguments. People want the facts. They want the arguments. They want to know the consequences. And I'll try to lay those out as Prime Minister as clearly as I can. But listening to our friends, listening to countries that wish us well, is part of the process and is a good thing to do.
As for the American elections, I've made some comments in recent weeks and months. I don't think now is a moment to add to them or subtract from them. [Laughter] But I think, Justin, as a Prime Minister who's been through two general elections leading my party, you always look on at the U.S. elections in awe of the scale of the process and the length of the process, and I marvel at anyone who is left standing at the end of it. [Laughter]
President Obama. Fortunately, we're term limited. [Laughter] So I, too, can look in awe at the process. [Laughter] Prime Minister Cameron. We have another British question from Laura Kuenssberg from the BBC.
White House Bust of Former Prime Minister Winston Churchill of the United Kingdom/United Kingdom-U.S. Relations/United Kingdom's European Union Membership Referendum
Q. Thank you. Mr. President, you've made your views very plain on the fact that British voters should choose to stay in the EU. But in the interest of good friends always being honest, are you also saying that our decades-old special relationship that's been through so much would be fundamentally damaged and changed by our exit? If so, how? And are you also—do you have any sympathy with people who think this is none of your business?
And, Prime Minister, to you, if I may, some of your colleagues believe it's utterly wrong that you have dragged our closest ally into the EU referendum campaign. What do you say to them? And is it appropriate for the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, to have brought up President Obama's Kenyan ancestry in the context of this debate?
Prime Minister Cameron. Well, let me—this is a British question, let me go first. I mean, first of all, questions for Boris are questions for Boris are questions for Boris, they're not questions for me.
I don't have some special power over the President of the United States. Barack feels strongly about this and has said what he's said. And as I said, it's our decision as a sovereign people, the choice we make about Europe, but I think it's right to listen to and consider the advice of your friends.
And just to amplify one of the points that Barack made, we have a shared interest of making sure Europe takes a robust approach to Russian aggression. And if you take those issues of the sanctions that we put in place through the European Union, I think I can put my hand on my heart and say that Britain played a really important role, and continues to play an important role, in making sure those sanctions were put in place and kept in place. I'm not sure it would have happened if we weren't there.
Now, if it's in our interests—and it is in our interest for Europe to be strong against aggression—how can it be in our interests not to be at that table and potentially to see those sanctions not take place? And I think it's been that working between Britain and the United States over this issue that has helped to make a big difference.
I would just say about the special relationship, to me—and I'm passionate about this, and I believe it very, very deeply, for all the reasons of the history and the language and the culture, but also about the future of our country—and the truth is this: The stronger Britain is, and the stronger America is, the stronger that relationship will be. And I want Britain to be as strong as possible. And we draw our strength from all sorts of things that we have as a country: the fifth largest economy in the world; amazing Armed Forces, brilliant security and intelligence forces, that we were discussing about how well they work together; incredibly talented people; brilliant universities; the fact that we're members of NATO, the G-7, the G-20, the Commonwealth. But we also draw strength and project strength and project power and project our values and protect our people and make our country wealthier and our people wealthier by being in the European Union.
So I want Britain to be as strong as possible. And the stronger Britain is, the stronger that special relationship is, and the more that we can get done together to make sure that we have a world that promotes democracy and peace and human rights and the development that we want to see across the world.
So to me, it's simple: Stronger Britain, stronger special relationship—that's in our interests, and that's in the interests of the United States of America as well.
President Obama. Let me start with Winston Churchill. [Laughter] You know, I don't know if people are aware of this, but in the Residence, on the second floor, my office, my private office is called the Treaty Room. And right outside the door of the Treaty Room, so that I see it every day—including on weekends, when I'm going into that office to watch a basketball game—[laughter]—the primary image I see is a bust of Winston Churchill. It's there voluntarily, because I can do anything on the second floor. [Laughter] I love Winston Churchill. I love the guy. [Laughter]
Now, when I was elected as President of the United States, my predecessor had kept a Churchill bust in the Oval Office. There are only so many tables where you can put busts; otherwise, it starts looking a little cluttered. [Laughter] And I thought it was appropriate, and I suspect most people here in the United Kingdom might agree, that as the first African American President, it might be appropriate to have a bust of Dr. Martin Luther King in my office to remind me of all the hard work of a lot of people who would somehow allow me to have the privilege of holding this office. That's just on Winston Churchill. I think people should know that, know my thinking there.
With respect to the special relationship, I have a staff member, who will not be named—because it might embarrass her a little bit—who, generally, on foreign trips, does not leave the hotel or the staff room because she's constantly doing work making this happen. She has had one request the entire time that I have been President, and that is, could she accompany me to Windsor on the off chance that she might get a peek at Her Majesty the Queen. And, gracious as she is, Her Majesty actually had this person, along with a couple of others, lined up so that as we emerged from lunch, they could say hello. And this staff person, who is as tough as they come, almost fainted and—[laughter]—which was—I'm glad she didn't because it would have caused an incident. [Laughter] That's the special relationship.
We are so bound together that nothing is going to impact the emotional and cultural and intellectual affinities between our two countries. So I don't come here suggesting in any way that that is impacted by a decision that the people of the United Kingdom may make around whether or not they're members of the European Union. That is there. That's solid. And that will continue, hopefully, eternally. And the cooperation in all sorts of ways—through NATO, through G-7, G-20—all those things will continue.
But, as David said, if one of our best friends is in an organization that enhances their influence and enhances their power and enhances their economy, then I want them to stay in it. Or at least I want to be able to tell them, you know, I think this makes you guys bigger players. I think this helps your economy. I think this helps to create jobs.
And so, ultimately, it's your decision. But precisely because we're bound at the hip, I want you to know that before you make your decision.

United Kingdom-U.S. Travel/Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Rights in the U.S./Syria/Death of Musician Prince R. Nelson Q. Thank you very much, sir. Mr. President, Vladimir Putin hasn't stopped Asad, as he led you to believe he would, and the cease-fire in Syria appears to be falling apart. Will you continue to bet on what looks to be a losing strategy?
Mr. Prime Minister, the U.K. today warned its citizens traveling to North Carolina and Mississippi about laws there that affect transgender individuals. As a friend, what do you think of those laws?
Mr. President, would you like to weigh in on that? And, sir, if you'd indulge us——
President Obama. Indulge—what do you mean?
Q. Well, indulge all of us back in the U.S., sir. Prince passed away. You were a fan. You had invited him to perform at the White House. Can you tell us what made you a fan?
President Obama. I'm trying to figure out which order to do this. [Laughter] Maybe I'll start with North Carolina and Mississippi. I want everybody here in the United Kingdom to know that the people of North Carolina and Mississippi are wonderful people. They are hospitable people. They are beautiful States, and you are welcome and you should come and enjoy yourselves. And I think you'll be treated with extraordinary hospitality.
I also think that the laws that have been passed there are wrong and should be overturned. And they're in response to politics, in part; in part, some strong emotions that are generated by people, some of whom are good people, but I just disagree with when it comes to respecting the equal rights of all people, regardless of sexual orientation, whether they're transgender or gay or lesbian. And although I respect their different viewpoints, I think it's very important for us not to send signals that anybody is treated differently.
And I think it's fair to say that we're not unique among countries where—particularly under a federal system in which power is dispersed, that there are going to be some localities or local officials that put forward laws that aren't necessarily reflective of a national consensus. But if you guys come to North Carolina or Mississippi, everybody will be treated well.
The second question with respect to Syria, I am deeply concerned about the cessation of hostilities fraying and whether it's sustainable. Now, keep in mind that I have always been skeptical about Mr. Putin's actions and motives inside of Syria. He is—along with Iran—the preeminent backer of a murderous regime that I do not believe can regain legitimacy within his country because he's murdered a lot of people.
Having said that, what I also believe is, is that we cannot end the crisis in Syria without political negotiations and without getting all the parties around the table to craft a transition plan. And that, by necessity, means that there are going to be some people on one side of the table who I deeply disagree with and whose actions I deeply abhor. That's how oftentimes you resolve conflicts like this that are taking an enormous toll on the Syrian people.
The cessation of hostilities actually held longer than I expected. And for 7 weeks, we've seen a significant reduction in violence inside that country. And that gave some relief to people.
I talked to Putin on Monday precisely to reinforce to him the importance of us trying to maintain the cessation of hostilities, asking him to put more pressure on Asad, indicating to him that we would continue to try to get the moderate opposition to stay at the negotiating table in Geneva. But this has always been hard. And it's going to keep being hard. And what David and I discussed in our meeting was that we will continue to prosecute the war against Daesh, against ISIL. We are going to continue to support those who are prepared to fight ISIL. And we're going to continue to target them. We're going to continue to make progress. But we're not going to solve the overall problem unless we can get this political track moving.
I assure you that we have looked at all options. None of them are great. And so we are going to play this option out. If in fact the cessation falls apart, we'll try to put it back together again even as we continue to go after ISIL. And it is in my belief—it's my belief that ultimately Russia will recognize that, just as this can't be solved by a military victory on the part of those we support, Russia may be able to keep the lid on, alongside Iran, for a while, but if you don't have a legitimate Government there, they will be bled as well. And that is not—that's not speculation on my part. I think the evidence all points in that direction.
And finally, with respect to Prince, I loved Prince because he put out great music and he was a great performer. I didn't know him well. He came to perform at the White House last year and was extraordinary and creative and original and full of energy. And so it's a remarkable loss.
And I'm staying at Winfield House, the U.S. Ambassador's residence. It so happens our Ambassador has a turntable, and so this morning we played ""Purple Rain"" and ""Delirious"" just to get warmed up—[laughter]—before we left the house for important bilateral meetings like this. [Laughter]
Prime Minister Cameron. As a fan of great music, the Ambassador has brought a lot of brilliant talent.
President Obama. Absolutely.
Prime Minister Cameron. Let me just answer: I've been to North Carolina many years ago and enjoyed it. I have not yet made it to Mississippi, but one day I hope to. The guidance that we put out, the Foreign Office, gives advice on travel, and it obviously deals with laws in situations as they are, and it tries to give that advice dispassionately, impartially. But it's very important that it does so. And it's something that a lot of attention is given to.
Our view on any of these things is that we believe that we should be trying to use law to end discrimination rather than to embed it or enhance it. And that's something we're comfortable saying to countries and friends anywhere in the world. But obviously, the laws people pass is a matter for their own legislatures. But we make clear our own views about the importance of trying to end discrimination, and we've made some important steps forward in our own country on that front, which we're proud of.
With that——
President Obama. All good?
Prime Minister Cameron. Thank you very much.
President Obama. Thank you very much, everybody."
"June 29, 2016","The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Justin P.J. Trudeau of Canada and President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico in Ottawa, Canada",Barack Obama,"Barack Obama, The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Justin P.J. Trudeau of Canada and President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico in Ottawa, Canada Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/318181",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-justin-pj-trudeau-canada-and-president,"Prime Minister Trudeau. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. President Obama, President Peña Nieto and I have just wrapped up a very productive meeting. The tone of the meeting was friendly, as you might expect among friends, but also a little poignant. We're obviously thrilled to have President Peña Nieto here for his first visit to Canada as President of Mexico. Yet, at the same time, it's a little sad that this will be the last chance for all three of us to get together in this capacity, given President Obama's impending retirement—[laughter]—something he pointed out to us more than once, I should add, usually with a little smile.
But I do want to once again thank both leaders and their delegations for coming to Ottawa and for being truly open to the discussions that took place today. One of the first items we discussed was our common respect for diversity and our firm support for LGBTQ2 rights, especially in the wake of the shootings earlier this month in Orlando.
[At this point, Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
The United States and Mexico both lost citizens in Orlando. That tragedy has strengthened our determination to protect the rights of LGBTQ2 people, and on behalf of—and we urge all leaders throughout the world to do the same.
We also talked about the need to ensure a clean and prosperous future for all of our people and for all of people in the world.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]
President Peña Nieto, President Obama, and I are unanimous in our belief that on this issue, North America can—and indeed must—lead the way.
Today we resolved—we turned that resolve into action with a negotiation of an ambitious and enduring North American Climate, Clean Energy, and Environment Partnership. This partnership will see our countries stand side by side as we work toward the common goal of a North America that is competitive, that encourages clean growth, and that protects our shared environment now and for generations to come. It's a partnership that lays out some very clear deliverables and that identifies realistic paths to achieving them.
Together, we will advance clean and secure energy with the goal of 50-percent clean power generation across the continent by 2025. We will drive down short-lived climate pollutants, things like methane, black carbon, and hydrofluorocarbons. We will promote clean and efficient transportation, creating clean jobs as we reduce energy consumption, air pollution, and greenhouse gases. We will work together to protect nature and to advance our scientific understanding of the environmental challenges we share. And finally, we will respond directly and decisively to the challenge of climate change, working to make our own countries more resilient as we encourage others to do the same. This is what can happen when countries come together in pursuit of a common goal, when we have a big idea and the political will to make it happen. Today's climate agreement stands as proof that cooperation pays off and that working together always beats going it alone.
There were, of course, other issues on the agenda as well.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
We also had the opportunity to talk about ways of advancing trade and competitiveness in North America. It's essential to each of our economies, and it is vital for the creation of good jobs for the middle class. Furthermore, we reasserted our common commitment to human rights, and we discussed the aspects on which we could be better partners to ensure the protection and defense of fundamental rights. We also discussed regional and worldwide issues that are urgent, and we talked about the way we will work together to meet these common challenges.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]
We talked about how to better cooperate on defense, but it also meant forging a closer working relationship when it comes to providing development and humanitarian assistance, as well as finding ways to more effectively combat public health challenges, the illicit flow of funds and drugs, and human trafficking.
As I said, the conversations were friendly, but also frank. And I'm reassured and encouraged by the progress we were able to make today.
Relationships between the citizens of our three nations have always been strong, even in the past when our governments haven't always seen eye to eye. It's gratifying that once again we are able to come together as leaders of three truly great nations to honor that enduring friendship and to once again deliver real results for the people of Canada, Mexico, the United States and, indeed, the entire global community.
Thank you, Barack and Enrique, for all your hard work today and every day.
I'd now like to introduce the President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto.
President Peña Nieto. Thank you very much, Prime Minister of Canada, Honorable Barack Obama. With this press conference, we come to an end of this day in Canada, today's state visit and today at the North American Leaders' Summit.
Prime Minister Trudeau, allow me to say once again how grateful I am for your hospitality, for the warmth with which we were received, myself and my delegation. We were warmly welcomed in this country. We're going back to Mexico with memories of the warm welcome that the Canadian people showed in Quebec, in Toronto, and Ottawa.
We're going back to Mexico fully convinced that we have renewed our bilateral relationship with Canada: Canada and yourself. Canada has a leader that is going back to universal values that make Canada stand out in the world.
President Barack Obama, I would like to say that we acknowledge your determination to have a more united, integrated, and competitive North America, a more prosperous and inclusive North America.
I would like to highlight, specifically being the last North American Leaders' Summit that you will attend to as a President of the United States, I would like to acknowledge that Mexico recognizes the fact that you have promoted, along Mexico, a strategic partnership, and you have always been willing to work towards a bilateral agenda that covers different fronts, beyond security. In the process of generating clean energy, you have favored those efforts. You have always favored a more expedited trade, a safer border, more competitiveness in our trade. You have always been in favor of having cooperation in education and cultural matters, have always been willing to push technology and science forward.
But there is no doubt that your legacy also covers other regions of Latin America. You have reestablished a relationship with Cuba. You have supported the development of Central America. And in the Summit of the Americas, as well, you have contributed to its advancement.
We would like to acknowledge as well your tireless efforts made towards the investment of the environment and of addressing the challenges of global warming. There is no doubt that your Presidency has helped to build and reaffirm the candid relationship that the United States and Mexico have.
During this trilateral summit, the governments of Canada, the United States, and Mexico, we have reaffirmed our decision to work together with a vision, with resolve to advance economic integration in North America. In order to fulfill this goal, Mexico values that in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, there is a great opportunity to reaffirm this level of integration between the three countries that are part of NAFTA. But besides that, we are taking this opportunity to other regions of the world, specifically towards Asia.
I believe that the advantages, the benefits, and the beauties that this integration will carry and has carried along for the benefit of our societies can be extended when the Trans-Pacific Partnership is approved. Mexico supports this effort with enthusiasm. This partnership, this agreement is at the Senate, in the process of being approved. We are fully convinced that by working together and by taking stock of our complementarity, we can be the most competitive region in the world, as Prime Minister Trudeau has said during this summit.
We have worked on addressing four priorities: climate change, clean energies and environment, competitiveness at the borders, and trade security and defense, and regional and global issues. Specifically, Mexico addressed the area of competitiveness in trade and in our borders.
I would like to highlight some of the most important agreements. We're going to create single trade windows to enable our border exchanges. Our goal is to have one foreign trade single window for North America.
Secondly, we're going to map North American clusters. This will be a vital tool for decisionmaking and to bolster economic trade in the region. We have agreed to have a trilateral cluster map as soon as possible.
And thirdly, I should mention that trilateral program for trusted travelers. Mexico has proposed that this program uses global entry platform that Canada and the United States already have. And this year, we will implement the electronic kiosks platform that is already present in different airports in the United States and Canada. This system, end result, will be used in North America as a whole. And this will be a system that will enable and expedite the flow and transit of individuals in North America.
Finally, I would like to use an example to describe our level of integration: the preservation of the monarch butterfly conservation. This is a species that, in its pilgrimage, we can see how our countries are intertwined. And back in our last summit, we agreed that we would take care of this species and make sure that, in its journey, the monarch butterfly from Canada, flying through the United States all the way down to Mexico. And the figures speak for itself.
In the year 2014, in our country, the area where butterflies reached that—eventually reached only covered less than one hectare, 0.6 hectares. Due to the efforts made by our trilateral task force, created for that purpose last year, this year's—the surface in my country now extends to 4.1 hectares, and we are en route that by 2018, this figure would grow to 6 hectares, and eventually, that would be our goal for the monarch butterfly reserve in Mexico. And by that, we will be making sure the migration of this species is the symbol of the relationship that Canada, the United States, and Mexico have.
The North American Leaders' Summit bears witness that isolated national efforts are insufficient. If we want favorable results for the benefit of our societies, it is better to work together as a region. We all know that vis-a-vis global challenges, isolationism is not the solution. In contrast, with what happens in other corners in the world, the countries in North America, we have decided to be closer, to work as a team, and to complement each other and to make progress together as the most competitive region in the world.
Thank you very much.
Prime Minister Trudeau. President Obama.
President Obama. Well, good afternoon. Bonjour. Buenas tardes. I want to thank my friends and partners, Prime Minister Trudeau and President Peña Nieto. To Justin and the people of Ottawa and Canada, thank you for your wonderful hospitality.
This is my fourth North American Leaders' Summit and the first that Canada is hosting in nearly a decade. And this reflects the new commitment that Prime Minister Trudeau has brought to our shared vision of a strong and integrated North America. So thank you so much, Justin.
Terrorist Attack in Istanbul, Turkey
Let me start by once again commenting on the horrific terrorist attack that took place yesterday in Istanbul's main international airport, which is one of the busiest airports in the world. The prayers of the American people are with the people of Turkey, the people of Istanbul, and all those who were affected by this terrible crime. We have offered all assistance that we have available to our ally, Turkey, and we stand prepared to assist them during this difficult time.
We're still learning all the facts, but we know this is part of our broader, shared fight against terrorist networks, and we will continue to work closely with Turkey to root them out. And meanwhile, we're going to do what's necessary to protect our people. I'm confident that we can and we will defeat those who offer only death and destruction. And we will always remember, even as there are those who are trying to divide us, that we are stronger when we come together and work toward a better world together.
Canada-Mexico-U.S. Relations
We're reminded of this basic fact at this summit. Combined, our three nations are home to nearly 480 million people. We are bound together by family, including millions of immigrants who trace their roots to each other's countries. We're not only among each other's top trade partners, we are a global hub of innovation, with integrated economies and supply chains and coproduction that span our borders. On every security and global challenge, we are partners. And we're united by common values of democracy and pluralism and a commitment to human dignity.
Over the past 8 years, I've worked to strengthen our partnerships with our friends in the Americas, and that begins with strengthening our relationship with Canada and Mexico. During my administration, for example, we boosted U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico by about 50 percent. That supports about 2.8 million American jobs. And today, as Justin and Enrique described, we agreed to build on that progress in several key areas.
First, we agreed to make it even easier to do business together so that our region is even more competitive. We're bringing more advanced technologies and automation to our border crossings, which will reduce wait times for travelers and make it more affordable to trade. By the end of this year, we'll have a Single Trusted Traveler Program for all three of our countries, which will make it easier to travel, while at the same time improving security. We'll continue to align our standards and regulations, which is especially important for small businesses who want to export more. We're going to do more together to promote women entrepreneurs and minority-owned businesses to succeed as well, and we're going to keep expanding our educational exchanges among our students.
As has been mentioned, we discussed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The politics of trade are always difficult in every country. I don't know any country where there aren't going to be some folks who argue against trade, but we all believe that in a integrated global economy, the goal is not for us to try to shut ourselves off from the world, but rather to work together to raise standards around the world for workers and for the environment. And that's exactly what TPP does. It's the right thing to do. And we're going to keep working for it.
Given the flood of steel and aluminum on global markets, however, it points to the fact that free trade also has to be fair trade. And our three countries agreed to work together on a range of trade measures to enforce our rights and protect our workers and ensure a level playing field for the steel and aluminum industries here in North America. And given the vote of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, our economic teams are going to continue to work together so that we remain focused on keeping our economies growing and making sure that the global financial system is stable, something I'm confident that we can do.
Second, we're making sure that North America remains a leader in the fight against climate change. And I could not be prouder of the work that Justin and Enrique have done to help realize this important goal. All three of our nations are now committed to joining the Paris Agreement this year so we can bring it into force. We're announcing a new goal across our continents of generating 50 percent of our electricity with clean power by 2025, which is a bold goal, but is a eminently achievable goal. The United States Government is making a major commitment to purchase more clean energy for Federal facilities and more clean and efficient Government vehicles. And all three of our countries are committing to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40 to 45 percent by 2025.
Third, we're going to do more to make sure that we're looking after the safety and health of our citizens from the danger of illicit drugs. And we're particularly focused right now on the epidemic of opioid abuse, including heroin, that is taking so many lives and devastating so many families. Our teams will meet this fall to make sure that we're coordinating our efforts, including more access to treatment. And as always, we will continue to be relentless against the criminals and narcotraffickers that are inflicting so much violence on communities. Fourth, we're deepening our cooperation on regional and global challenges: joint efforts against diseases like Zika; helping our Central American partners address poverty and violence that have led to so many families and children making an extraordinarily dangerous trip to flee difficult circumstances.
I want to thank Justin and Enrique for their governments' strong support of our new approach to Cuba. And I'm also glad that our countries have agreed to do more around the world to address the refugee crisis and expand our peacekeeping efforts.
In our own hemisphere, with the historic agreement in Colombia, a major step toward peace, our three nations are going to help the Colombians remove landmines as just one example of efforts to fortify what has been a very difficult negotiation.
And given the very serious situation in Venezuela and the worsening plight of the Venezuelan people, together we're calling on the Government and opposition to engage in meaningful dialogue and urge the Venezuelan Government to respect the rule of law and the authority of the National Assembly. Political prisoners should be released, the democratic process should be respected, and that includes legitimate efforts to pursue a recall referendum consistent with Venezuelan law.
In closing, we're determined to keep building on the progress that's been made at so many of the previous summits. And by the way, Enrique Enrique, I love the story about monarch butterflies. They're not just any species, they are spectacular. And we want to make sure that our children and our grandchildren can see them as well.
We're creating what we call the North American Caucus, which means our three governments will meet on a more regular basis. We're going to continue to deepen our trilateral cooperation in this hemisphere and around the world. And in short, we're going to do more to speak with one, united North American voice on the world stage. We couldn't have better partners than Justin and Enrique. I'm confident that we're going to continue to advance regional cooperation and integration, and that's not just going to be good for our own people, that will be good for the world as well.
Merci beaucoup. Muchas gracias.
Prime Minister Trudeau's Director of Communications Kate Purchase. Thank you.
[Ms. Purchase continued in French, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
So we're now ready to start with the question period.
[She continued in English as follows.]
Our first question is from Canadian journalist Richard Madan from CTV News.
Trade/United Kingdom's Referendum Vote To Leave the European Union/Economic Globalization
Q. Hi. Good afternoon, gentlemen. One of the candidates who wants to replace President Obama has already said he wants to renegotiate NAFTA and walk away from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, all suggesting that perhaps there's a growing disconnect between the protrade message you're selling here and the protectionist voices we're hearing in the U.S. and possibly the Brexit in the U.K. So my question is to all three of you: What is your strategy to reverse this growing sentiment? And, Prime Minister Trudeau, en français aussi. If the rest of you speak French, that's great. [Laughter]
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Prime Minister Trudeau. First of all, our strategy is to highlight how much trade and positive agreements among our nations are good not only for the economy of the world and the economy of our countries, but it's also good for our citizens. We know that industries that export more goods pay salaries that are 50 percent higher than sectors that don't export. We also know that trade gives rise to good jobs, innovation, and progress for individuals as well.
In our conversations today and yesterday with President Peña Nieto, we signed agreements and held conversations that allowed us to remove visas for Mexican visitors to Canada. This will have effects on all Canadians who live in communities that welcome Mexican tourists. It will also allow Canadian agriculture producers to have access to the Mexican beef market.
These are examples of the cooperation that we say is good for the North American market, but also good for the entire world. And it's with this in mind that it's important to come together, to talk together about the future of this world, where we are more and more connected. And we have to agree more and more in this world.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]
Our response to the kinds of protectionism that we're seeing around the world is indeed to highlight that when we come together like in events, like this North American Leaders' Summit, there's an opportunity to come together in ways that are beneficial for the global economy, that are beneficial for our countries' economies, but mostly, that are beneficial for individual citizens.
We know that export-intensive industries pay, on average, 50 percent higher wages than nonexporting industries. We know that trade leads to innovation and opportunities for communities, for individuals, for workers. Now, we need to make sure that we're dealing with challenges and problems as they come up, and that's where a constant, engaged dialogue comes with positive outcomes.
Just yesterday, with President Peña Nieto, we were able to establish forward movement on two difficult issues between our—not just our countries, but our peoples, which will have a beneficial impact on both sides of the deal. We will be lifting visas for visitors to Mexico—to Canada from Mexico, which will have a positive impact on communities across country—the country as we welcome in tourists, but also, we've been able to secure access for Canadian farmers to sell their beef in Mexico.
These are good, concrete things that happen when we pull together and deal with important issues. And always, there will be people trying to get us all to turn inwards. But the fact is, our world is interconnected in so many ways, that it is much better that we engage, that we work through our challenges together because, really, that's how we end up with the kind of growth that benefits our countries and our citizens.
President Peña Nieto. I'll be very brief in addressing your question. There is sometimes that what one has, has not been valued enough until you lose them. And what this integration has managed to achieve in North America is precisely to give two or three countries more opportunities and to give our societies more opportunities by growing trade, by having more investment in our three countries.
In our three countries, we see opportunities growing and reaching out to more people. Academic exchanges and the possibility of studying abroad in any of the three countries represented here by three heads of state are outcomes of our trilateral agreements. I believe that we are all aware of how the reactions are of what happened in the U.K., and there's still uncertainty. The outcome of the referendum is uncertain. But when someone values what you had, that is when we see such reactions.
So we are here trying to innovate, to be more competitive. Why? Because we are competitors, yes, but we have complementary economies. And that would give more development to our societies. I believe that this is the main goal of our efforts. The agreements made here are not only agreements made by three heads of state. We are building roads, we're building the foundation so that our societies can have strong foundations and get—go further. And that makes a great contrast. When some other countries choose isolationism, they choose protectionistic measures, and they are not letting their societies project themselves to other kinds of scenarios.
President Obama. Well, let me make a couple of points. First of all, the integration of national economies into a global economy, that's here. That's done. And so the question is not whether or not there's going to be a international global economy. There is one: technology, travel, massive cargo containers that can ship goods back and forth; the fact that a company can move capital around the world in the blink of an eye; the fact that an engineer can send plans to the other side of the world in an instant to a colleague. Those are facts.
So we have an integrated economy already. The question is, under what terms are we going to shape that economy? And it is my firm belief that making sure that how we trade, how we exchange goods, it is my firm belief that shaping those in accordance with the values that our three countries care deeply about is going to be good for us and us trying to abandon the field and pull up the drawbridge around us is going to be bad for us.
Now, with respect to Brexit, I think it's important to point out that those who argued about leaving the European Union are the same folks who the very next day are insisting, don't worry, we're still going to have access to the single market. So, apparently, their argument was not against trade generally. They just didn't want any obligations—[laughter]—to go with the access to the free market. And it's important for us not to draw easy analogies between what happened in the U.K. and the EU versus what's happening between our three countries in terms of trade, or what's happening in terms of us attempting to access Asian markets through TPP. That's point number one.
Point number two: Ordinary people who have concerns about trade have a legitimate gripe about globalization, because the fact is that as the global economy is integrated, what we've seen are trend lines across the advanced economies of growing inequality and stagnant wages and a smaller and smaller share of overall productivity and growth going to workers and a larger portion going to the top 1 percent. And that's a real problem. Because if that continues, the social cohesion and political consensus needed for liberal market economies starts breaking down.
So they're right to be concerned about that. I'm concerned about it, Justin is concerned about it, and Enrique is concerned about it. The question is, what do you do about it? And the prescription of withdrawing from trade deals and focusing solely on your local market, that's the wrong medicine: first of all, because it's not feasible, because our auto plants, for example, would shut down if we didn't have access to some parts in other parts of the world. So we'd lose jobs, and the amount of disruption that would be involved would be enormous. Secondly, we'd become less efficient. Costs of our goods in our own countries would become much more expensive.
And this nostalgia about an era when everybody was working in manufacturing jobs and you didn't need a college degree and you could go in and as long as you worked hard you could support a family and live a middle class life, that has been undermined far more by automation than it has been by outsourcing or the shift of jobs to low-income—or low-wage countries. I mean, the steel industry is producing as much steel in the United States as it ever was. It's just it needs one-tenth of the workers that it used to.
And this is why my pushback on both the left and the right when it comes to protectionism or antitrade arguments is, you are right to be concerned about the trends, but what you're prescribing will not work. And there's a better way of doing this. And the better way of doing it is, countries like ours that have high wage—high labor standards and high environmental standards and strong protection of intellectual property and rule of law, we've got to get out there and help to shape those rules so that they work for our workers and our businesses. Because if we don't, China will write the rules, and they may not have the same regard for the values that we care about. Other countries will write the rules in ways that disadvantage our workers and our businesses.
In Asia right now, there are a whole lot of tariffs that keep our products out, but because we happen to be some of the most open nations in the world, they're selling our stuff in. So we can't disengage; we ought to engage more. And if we combine that with investments in education and tax policies that are fair and making sure that college is affordable, and we're strengthening the safety net, and we're rebuilding our infrastructure—which are jobs that cannot be exported—and we're making investments in research and development, and we're building an inclusive society in which everybody has got a fair shot, that's how we're going to solve these problems.
And what is absolutely true is, is that too many folks who have been in charge around the world have neglected that side of the equation. So we're going to keep on pushing hard to shape an international order that works for our people. But we're not going to be able to do that by cutting off trade, because that's going to make all of us poorer.

Ms. Purchase. Thank you. We can now take the second question. Daniel Venegas, Milenio.
U.S. Presidential Election/Mexico-U.S. Relations/Immigration
Q. Good afternoon. I would like to ask you, we have the election process going on in the United States. There is an anti-immigrant and anti-Mexican rhetoric by Donald Trump. I would like to ask you, did you address this issue during your meeting? And how can you ring fence the agreements that you have described and the positive outcomes of your trilateral relationship? What would happen if someone who is not in agreement—he has said it that NAFTA—they would step back from NAFTA. What did you address in your meetings? Thank you. President Peña Nieto. I would like to begin by saying that we did address the issue and we have discussed it during the state visit. Specifically, I would speak on behalf of Mexico. My Government will respect the election process, which is a domestic process for the United States. We are getting ready to work with whomever turns out to be President of the United States.
And the best way to ring fence the progress and agreements that have been made so far is to explain clearly and let the people feel the beauties and the benefits of all the work we do. Most of what we have today, it's not random. It might be a gift from God, but it is actually the outcome of our work of the foundations and the work we have done so far. And I believe that in the end of the day, what we managed to achieve today would teach us a lesson. It would be for the Americans to define who would provide them better guarantees to move into the path towards growth and development based upon what we have managed to build in the past.
President Obama. Well, I think Enrique is right. Whoever becomes the President of the United States is going to have a deep, strong interest in having a strong relationship with Mexico. It's our neighbor, our friend, and one of our biggest trading partners.
I think I've made myself clear, setting aside whatever the candidates are saying, that America is a nation of immigrants. That's our strength. Unless you are one of the First Americans, unless you are a Native American, somebody somewhere in your past showed up from someplace else. And they didn't always have papers. And the genius of America has been to define ourselves not by what we look like or what our last name is or what faith we practice, but our adherence to a common creed: a belief that all people are created equal; a belief in free speech and freedom of assembly and democracy and pluralism and tolerance and rule of law. And we have observed those ideals imperfectly at times, but in each successive generation, we've gotten a little bit better at it. We've come closer to our ideals.
And the notion that somehow we would stop now on what has been a tradition of attracting talent and strivers and dreamers from all around the world, that would rob us of the thing that is most special about America. And I don't think it will happen.
Now, people are genuinely concerned about immigration that is not orderly, people pouring across borders without having gone through some sort of process. It adds to people's sense that things are out of control. And that's why we've invested in securing our borders, and we've made unprecedented investments. It's part of the reason why illegal immigration to the United States is actually at its lowest level since the 1970s. It's why we so value the cooperation that we've obtained from the Mexican Government in making sure that our borders work to facilitate legal trade and legal immigration and commerce, but discourages illegal immigration.
It's why I'm pushing very hard, and will continue to push until I leave this office—and expect the next President to push—for a comprehensive immigration reform plan that can fix those aspects of the system that are broken so that we remain a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.
And that's ultimately, I think, where people in the United States will land. We've had times throughout our history where anti-immigration sentiment is exploited by demagogues. It was directed at the Irish. It was directed at Poles and Italians. And you can go back and read what was said about those groups, and it's identical to what they're now saying about Mexicans or Guatemalans or Salvadorians or Muslims or Asians. Same stuff: ""They're different."" ""They're not going to fit."" ""They won't assimilate."" ""They bring crime."" Same arguments. You go back to the 1800s, the language is identical. But guess what? They kept coming. And they kept coming because America offered possibility for their children and their grandchildren. And even if they were initially discriminated against, they understood that our system will, over time, allow them to become part of this one American family.
And so we should take some of this rhetoric seriously and answer it boldly and clearly. But you shouldn't think that that is representative of how the American people think.
Ms. Purchase. And now our third question from the United States, reporter Roberta Rampton from Reuters. Thank you.
President Obama. I should point out that Roberta is also secretly from Canada. [Laughter]
Q. Not so secretly. [Laughter]
President Obama. So Canadians are now getting an extra question. [Laughter]
U.S. Presidential Election/United Kingdom's Referendum Vote To Leave the European Union/Economic Globalization/United Kingdom-U.S. Relations
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Given how the Brexit vote shook the stability of the global economy, do you feel that you need to do more to calm the markets quickly and perhaps encourage a quick exit, rather than something that's long and drawn out? Do you still feel that the U.K. should be at the back of the queue for a trade deal with the United States? And are you going to make a full-throated pitch for the TPP, for your prescription, when you're out on the campaign trail this summer, stumping for Secretary Clinton?
And, Prime Minister Trudeau, both—I mean, you seem to be quite careful when you talk about Mr. Trump. Renegotiating NAFTA or tearing it up would be such a disaster for Canada. Why not come out and say that forcefully?
And, President Peña Nieto, in March you compared Mr. Trump to Hitler and Mussolini. I'm wondering if you still stand by that. And how worried are you that this time next year there will be a wall up on your border?
President Obama. Okay. [Laughter] Excellent questions, Roberta.
Prime Minister Trudeau. She doesn't sound Canadian. [Laughter] That was pretty mean. [Laughter]
President Obama. Canadians are a little more subtle. [Laughter]
I'm actually going to help out my friends a little bit on your last question, even though it wasn't directed at me, and just say, when I visit other countries, it's not my job to comment on candidates in the middle of a race, just because they may end up winning. And the relationship between governments tend to transcend whoever is in power at any given time. So it's a tough question. It's—I'm not saying they shouldn't answer it, I'm just—I'm helping them out a little bit. [Laughter] Because there's no doubt that when I visit countries, there are times where I've got preferences, but I'd rarely express them.
With respect to Brexit, first of all, I think you've seen the markets settle down a little bit over the last couple of days. I didn't follow the markets today. But we're monitoring very carefully whether there's any systemic strains on the system. And so far, what you've seen is reactions in the market, stock prices, currencies. But I think the preparations that were done by central banks and Finance Ministers, our Treasury Secretary, indicate the degree to which the global economy in the short run will hold steady. I think there are some genuine longer term concerns about global growth if in fact Brexit goes through and that freezes the possibilities of investment in Great Britain or in Europe as a whole. At a time when global growth rates were weak already, this doesn't help.
And so when we attend the G-20 summit in China later this year, one of the major topics—which is something that I've continually advocated for during the 7½ years that I've been President—is we all have to look at what we can do to boost global demand: whether it's the United States adopting a more robust budget for infrastructure improvements and fixing water systems in Flint, Michigan, or repairing airports that are not as efficient as they should be or rebuilding our power grid so that it can take advantage of clean energy; whether it's Germany, a country with a surplus, doing more in terms of spending, or Europe as a whole lifting some of the austerity constraints that have been placed on them; whether it's China shifting to a more consumer-based, domestic-based growth strategy as opposed to trying to export its way out of problems. There are going to be a whole host of measures that all of us can take to fortify the global economy, and that should be a top priority of ours.
With respect to the actual Brexit negotiations, my main message to David Cameron, Angela Merkel and others is: Everybody should catch their breath, come up with a plan and a process that is orderly, that's transparent, that people understand, and then proceed, understanding that both sides have a stake in getting this right. And I think that that will be a difficult, challenging process, but it does not need to be a panicky process. I think it can be a steady, sensible process.
Obviously, leadership issues in Great Britain will need to be resolved for it to move as crisply and as effectively as it needs to, but that—I think that's recognized, and that should happen fairly quickly. And I know that, speaking with Chancellor Merkel, that her interest is not in retribution, her interest is in making sure that the process works. And I have a lot of confidence in people being able to do that. And we will help in any way that we can to facilitate that.
And then, the last part of your question is with respect to the U.K. and any trade agreement with the United States. Frankly, we will be the least of their problems right now, because their first order of business is going to be to address the market where they sell half their goods, which is Europe. And these things are not easily negotiated, particularly because we've been spending our time trying to negotiate with the European Union. And so to suddenly go off on another track will be challenging. But I think their first and primary concern is going to be to try to figure out how they interact with the European Union and the European market if in fact—and when in fact—they leave.
I have emphasized throughout, though, that the special relationship that we have with Great Britain does not change; that the ties of affection and family and language and institutions and culture and the business relationships that exist, those are so deep and so long lasting—the cooperation we have on security issues and on global challenges, those are so fundamental—that our relationship with the U.K. fundamentally doesn't change.
We are concerned that their absence from the European Union and the potential disruptions within Europe make it harder for us to solve some of the other challenges that have to be solved.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]
Prime Minister Trudeau. One of the things that's easy to forget amid the inflated rhetoric of an election campaign is that the relationship between our three countries goes far deeper than any individual leaders. And if the three of us get along, it's not just because we're aligned in many different values and priorities, it is very much because we serve citizens who are, they themselves, tremendously aligned in terms of priorities, in terms of hopes and dreams, in terms of desire for success and ways to reach it.
So when you look at the level of integration, of our supply chains, of our markets, of the flow back and forward across borders of goods, of people, and the tremendous benefits that have come from proximity and strong relationships to individual citizens across this continent, it's essential that we understand that regardless of electoral rhetoric, Canada, the United States, and Mexico will continue to have tremendously close relationships economically, culturally, socially, familialy, historically, and towards the future.
So as I've said many times, and I'll say again, I look forward to working with whomever the American people choose to elect as their President in November. I know that we will always be able to find shared priorities and challenges that we want to work together to overcome. And I know that our commitment to doing what's right and what's best for our citizens will lead us to much more alignment than differentiation.
President Peña Nieto. Roberta, I'll go straight to the point to describe the stand of my administration and my own very personal point of view. I've said it, and I'll say it again: My Government will respect fully the domestic electoral process in the United States. I don't think I've said anything different from what I'm stating once again here. What I have said is that today—and I did not make reference to a specific place—my words reinforce what I believe.
I believe that in this global scenario—and I'll use President Obama's words, and as he said, he gave us a hand to address this question—we are facing a global reality. We have a populist world, an interconnected world with its own challenges. What I have said is that, in the world we're living, in different places, we have political leaders, political stakeholders that use demagoguery and have the populistic slogans that want to eliminate and destroy what has been built, what has taken decades to build to go back to problems of the past. And yes, it is true, all the benefits have not reached society as we whole. That is true. But those leaderships, those political actors, by using populism and demagoguery, they choose the easiest way to solve the challenges of today's world. And things are not that simplistic. It's not as easy as that. To lead a country, to take on a responsibility to rule a country, it goes beyond giving the easiest answer. It is complex and it is difficult to lead a country.
And I just said it: What we have reached so far—the level of development, the level of well-being that we have in the world—without a doubt makes contrast with what the situation that we lived 30 years back. Never before a global society—or the societies, at least, of our three countries—had lived the level of development and well-being that we enjoy today. Never before had our countries had a high life expectancy as we have today. Never before had we had the opportunity to have access to the knowledge of the world as fast and as easy as we do today. Never before were in such a level of connection between society and the possibility of having access to any product from any corner of the world as we do today. And that was built throughout the years by using the model based on openness, free trade, trade agreements.
And the biggest challenge today is to make sure that those benefits reach out to every single citizen. But the solution proposed by some is not by destroying what we have been built, it is not taking a different route to choose the road towards isolationism and destruction. What we need to do is to keep up the pace towards development. And when I said that, I mentioned that most of what some people say, it is very similar that in the past—and President Obama already said it, even years back—but in the past, some leaders addressed their societies in those terms. Hitler and Mussolini did that. And the outcome, it's clear to everyone: It resulted in devastation, and it turned out to be a tragedy for mankind. And we saw it last century.
That was my message when I made reference to this event. My message was about to value what we have and also to be aware of the road that we need to walk still. But that's the benefit that we're looking forward to: take the benefits to our societies.
[Ms. Purchase spoke in English as follows.]
Ms. Purchase. [Inaudible]—last question.
[Ms. Purchase continued in French, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
The question will be from Mr. Philippe-Vincent Foisy of Cogeco News.
[The reporter spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Canada-Mexico-U.S. Energy Cooperation/Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources/Populism/U.S. Presidential Election
Q. Mr. Trudeau, with the goals that you have said are ambitious for clean energy, does this mean the U.S. will import more hydroelectricity?
[The reporter continued in English as follows.]
[Inaudible]—to produce more clean energy, does it mean that the United States will have to import more hydroelectricity from Canada?
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]
Prime Minister Trudeau. Certainly, the agreement that we've concluded today values our shift towards cleaner, renewable energy. Canada has a tremendous amount of energy that comes from clean sources right now. And we're always looking to create more.
How we work together as—not just as two countries, but as three countries—on energy solutions that give opportunities to our citizens while protecting future generations from the impacts of climate change is something that we are all entirely agreed on.
One of the things that we've learned—and this is through the Paris Agreement and through years of following different paths towards solutions—is, there is no one single solution to our energy challenges or to the challenges posed by climate change; that we need to be creative, we need to be innovative, and we need to work together. And that's why the conclusion of this ambitious continental energy strategy is so important in how we are going to do not just our share to combat the global challenge that is climate change, but to demonstrate leadership and show that clean energy and clean growth are exactly the solution and the opportunity that we face because of climate change.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
It's true that the agreement that we came to today is very important because it allows us to fight climate change, but it's also very important when it comes to investing in green energy, clean growth, and our country. I know that we will have to pursue multiple, different solutions when it comes to clean energy, but cooperation and the collaboration that we've highlighted today among our three countries will give rise to innovative solutions that are positive in the area of green energy.
I can't wait to work with the United States and with Mexico in order that, together, we are able to face climate change challenges. It's not just a matter of doing our fair share, it's a matter of showing leadership in the world when it comes to climate change and clean energy. We have to do more than our share. We have to show that the future of the environment and the economy involves taking responsible decisions for the environment and green energy.
Thank you.
President Peña Nieto. Even when this question was addressed to the U.S. and Canada, I would like to say that Mexico, in this trilateral relationship, and as it has been mentioned here, we also are committed to clean energy. Mexico has revamped its legal framework so that, by 2024, at least 35 percent of the generation of energy is clean too. This is an agreement made in this trilateral meeting to reduce other pollutants like methane.
What I would like to say is that our three countries share the same agenda in environmental issues. We're—have agreed to protect our world and to find solutions that we're already working on.
President Obama. Well, Justin, I think, got it right, which is that we've set a goal and we are coordinating and synchronizing best practices. And there's going to be an energy mix in each of our countries that's going to be different. And some of it is going to be determined by what natural resources we have; it's going to be determined by how well we can integrate the grid and transmission of power.
So there may be some wonderful hydroelectric power that we'd like to get to the United States. The question is, are there enough transmission facilities for us to be able to buy it at a competitive price. Just as we develop wind energy, we have to build an infrastructure to get wind produced in South Dakota down to Chicago. And each of us, I think, are going to have national plans. But the point is that by setting these goals, creating these coordinating mechanisms, we're in a better position to take advantage of the confluence of interests and economies and opportunities.
And I view this clean energy sector as an enormous opportunity. Look, oil is cheap right now, but it's not going to be cheap. I've said this before: Those of you who are buying gas guzzlers, I'm telling you—[laughter]—because it is a finite resource and becomes more and more expensive to extract and people are taking climate change more and more seriously.
And so we're in a transition phase, but in the meantime, technology is moving. And solar and wind and hydro and biomass and entire technologies we haven't even thought of yet—there is some 15-year-old kid somewhere who is figuring it out. I don't know whether he's in Mexico or Canada or the United States or China or Saudi Arabia, but somebody is out there going to figure this out. And I want that opportunity to accrue to our workers, our people, our communities. And whoever wins this race is going to—everybody else is going to follow. And I believe that we have the brainpower and the architecture to lead. And we have such a huge market between our three countries that we can test out a lot of these opportunities and figure out which work best.
If you'll allow me, I want to say one last thing, though, because it's been a running thread in a bunch of questions, and that's this whole issue of populism. Maybe somebody can pull up in a dictionary quickly the phrase ""populism,"" but I'm not prepared to concede the notion that some of the rhetoric that's been popping up is populist.
When I ran in 2008, and the reason I ran again, and the reason even after I leave this office I will continue to work in some capacity in public service is because I care about people and I want to make sure every kid in America has the same opportunities that I had. And I care about poor people who are working really hard and don't have a chance to advance. And I care about workers being able to have a collective voice in the workplace and get their fair share of the pie. And I want to make sure that kids are getting a decent education and a working mom has childcare that she can trust. And I think we should have a tax system that's fair and that folks like me who have been—have benefited from the incredible opportunities in my society should pay a little bit more to make sure that somebody else's kids who weren't as lucky have those same opportunities.
And I think there should be curbs on the excesses of our financial sector so that we don't repeat the debacles of 2007 and 2008. And I think there should be transparency in how our systems work so that we don't have people dodging taxes by setting up offshore accounts in other places and avoiding the responsibilities that their fellow citizens who don't have fancy lawyers and accountants, that they can't benefit from those same tricks.
Now, I suppose that makes me a populist. Now, somebody else who has never shown any regard for workers, has never fought on behalf of social justice issues or making sure that poor kids are getting a decent shot at life or have health care—in fact, have worked against economic opportunity for workers and ordinary people—they don't suddenly become a populist because they say something controversial in order to win votes. That's not the measure of populism. That's nativism or xenophobia or worse. Or it's just cynicism.
So I would just advise everybody to be careful about suddenly attributing to whoever pops up at a time of economic anxiety the label that they're populist. Where have they been? Have they been on the frontlines working on behalf of working people? Have they been carrying the laboring oar to open up opportunity for more people?
Now, there are people like Bernie Sanders who I think genuinely deserved the title, because he has been in the vineyards fighting on behalf of these issues. And there, the question is just going to be, all right, we share values, we share goals, how do we achieve them?
And I do think Enrique's broader point is right, which is, sometimes, there are simple solutions out there, but, I don't know, I've been President for 7½ years, and it turns out, that's pretty rare. [Laughter] And the global economy is one of those areas where there aren't a lot of simple solutions. And there aren't a lot of shortcuts to making sure that more people have opportunity in our countries. We are going to have to educate our kids better, and that takes time. We've got to make sure our manufacturing sector is more dynamic and competitive, and that takes time. We've got to restructure our Tax Codes to incentivize the right things and make sure workers are getting higher pay. That takes time. We've got to raise minimum wages. We've got to make sure that college is affordable. We have to restructure and reform our financial sectors so they're not reckless, but we've got to do so in ways that don't destroy the entire system and throw millions of people suddenly out of work.
And when we bailed out the auto industry, that wasn't popular. So maybe I wasn't populist. But I tell you what, all those automakers—all those UAW members, both here in the United States and in Canada are pretty happy I did, even though it was—had about 10 percent popularity at the time—even in states like Michigan. So, I don't know, maybe that was an elitist move on my part because it didn't poll well. Last time I visited an auto plant, though, they were pretty happy.
So let's just be clear that somebody who labels ""us"" versus ""them,"" or engages in rhetoric about how we're going to look after ourselves and take it to the other guy—that's not the definition of populism.
Sorry. [Laughter] This is one of the prerogatives of when you're at the end of your term, you just kind of—[laughter]—you go on these occasional rants. [Laughter]
[Ms. Purchase spoke in French, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Ms. Purchase. And with this, we conclude our press conference.
[She continued in English as follows.]
Thank you very much. Merci. Muchas gracias."
"July 22, 2016",The President's News Conference With President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico,Barack Obama,"Barack Obama, The President's News Conference With President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/317633",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-enrique-pena-nieto-mexico,"President Obama. Good morning, everybody. Buenos dias. Please have a seat. It is always a great pleasure to welcome my good friend and partner, President Peña Nieto of Mexico, to the White House, and his delegation. Enrique and I just worked together at the North American Leaders' Summit in Ottawa last month. Today we have two of the ""Three Amigos""—[laughter]—although, the handshake is a little easier when it's just between two people. [Laughter]
Let me start by saying something that is too often overlooked, but bears repeating, especially given some of the heated rhetoric that we sometimes hear. The United States values tremendously our enduring partnership with Mexico and our extraordinary ties of family and friendship with the Mexican people.
Mexico is our third largest trading partner. We sell more to Mexico than we do to China, India, and Russia combined. Every year, millions of tourists and businesspeople and friends and family cross our border legally. Every day, $1.5 billion in trade and investment crosses our border, and that's trade that supports over a million jobs right here in the United States. On a whole host of issues, from our shared security to climate change, Mexico is a critical partner and is critically important to our own well-being. We're not just strategic and economic partners, we're also neighbors, and we're friends, and we're family, including millions of Americans that are connected to Mexico by ties of culture and of language.
And that's why, as President, I've worked to deepen the partnership between our two nations. And today Enrique and I discussed ways to keep strengthening the U.S.-Mexico partnership.
First, through forums like our high-level economic dialogue, we're going to keep working to boost trade and grow our economies and create more opportunity for our people. With today's air transport agreement, we're expanding the number of airports that businesses and consumers can fly from, which will make travel and trade more affordable and more efficient. Both our countries are working hard to bring into effect the Trans-Pacific Partnership so that our workers can compete on a level playing field across the Asia-Pacific region and can open up doors to new markets.
I reiterated to President Peña Nieto that although I am disappointed in the Supreme Court's failure to come to a decision on our immigration executive action, it is my firm belief that it will be in the interests of the United States, especially our economic interest, to pursue comprehensive immigration reform.
Second, we are deepening our robust partnership on energy and environmental issues. Both of our nations are committed to ensuring that the historic Paris Agreement is fully implemented, and we're going to keep on working towards the goal that we announced last month in Ottawa, generating half the electricity in North America through clean power by 2025.
With that goal in mind, we are pursuing an agreement this year on sharing civilian nuclear technology. This fall, our new U.S.-Mexico Energy Business Council will meet for the very first time to strengthen the ties between our energy industries. And, Mr. President, I want to thank you for your vision and your leadership in reforming Mexico's energy industry. I'm also pleased that our nations will continue working to protect our shared ecosystems and environmental heritage.
Third, we'll continue to protect the health and safety of our people, especially from the opioid epidemic that is taking so many lives and devastating so many communities. Both of our nations, we agreed, share a responsibility to combat this crisis. Here in the United States, we're working to improve treatment and prevention and reduce the availability of illicit drugs. And I applaud President Peña Nieto's commitment to combating organized crime and for developing a new plan to curb poppy cultivation and heroin production. We continue to deploy 21st-century technologies to secure our shared border. And as Mexico makes important reforms to its judicial system, we are working together to strengthen law enforcement and to strengthen observance of human rights and the rule of law.
Fourth, we're stepping up our efforts to tackle regional and global challenges, from confronting cyber threats to fighting diseases like Zika and Dengue. We'll keep partnering with Central American countries to address the instability and poverty that's prompted so many people to embark on the dangerous journey north. And even as we address migration challenges in our own hemisphere, I am very grateful that Mexico is taking an important step on refugee issues and will be cohosting our refugee summit at the United Nations this September.
And finally, we continue to strengthen the strong ties between our people. We want more American students studying in Mexico. We want more Mexican students studying in the United States. So today we agreed to extend and update our educational cooperation. Through efforts like our 100,000 Strong in the Americas initiative, we're expanding opportunities for educational exchanges and scientific partnerships and research collaborations. And we're working to help girls learn around the world, including Mexico's commitment to support teachers and schools throughout Latin America and the Caribbean.
In closing, since this is most likely to be our final White House meeting, I'm reminded of what President Peña Nieto said when he first came here almost 4 years ago. Enrique, you said that our nations had a great opportunity ""to have a closer link of brotherhood, of sisterhood, of collaboration, and of course, of great accomplishments."" I am proud of what we've achieved together and proud to stand with you and the Mexican people as our brothers and sisters in progress. And I'm confident that our nations will continue to grow even stronger and more prosperous together in the future.
Muchas gracias. Thank you very much.
President Peña Nieto. Good afternoon, everyone. First of all, I would like to thank President Barack Obama for this very kind invitation to be holding this official visit here at the White House, perhaps the last one that will be taking place here at the White House during your administration, President Obama.
And I would also like to particularly here say how important this friendship is, the friendship we have always had from President Obama. And he has been, and his administration, they have been very good neighbors. He has been a very good neighbor and a President committed with the less favored of his country and with stability also and harmony in our hemisphere and with a solution of global challenges, as for instance climate change, international migration, and the reduction of nuclear weapons. I would also like to recognize in his administration the decisive support of favoring migrants, including the over 35 million people of Mexican origin who live in the United States, who are part of the generation of wealth and employment in this country.
I would also like to take advantage of expressing our condolences of the Mexican people, my personal condolences, for the lamentable events in Texas and Louisiana.
I fully recognize and acknowledge in President Obama a leader committed in our bilateral relationship, which I should say is today going through one of its best moments and stages in the relationship of the history between our two countries.
In this visit, we have agreed to work on an agenda since 2013, a multithematic agenda favoring regional competitiveness. We coincided during our meeting this morning on the importance of institutionalizing accomplishments so that they will be lasting throughout time, with a bilateral forum on higher education. This year, over 64,000 Mexican students will be carrying out academic activities here in the United States.
And on the other hand, the high-level economic dialogue, with the participation of officials of both administrations of the highest ranking level, has undoubtedly become a platform for integration, competitiveness, and growth. And we have also agreed, ladies and gentlemen, in this meeting to give it a permanent character so that the benefits that derive from this dialogue will be extended throughout time.
Now we have joint cargo inspection programs to reduce costs of up to 50 percent—that is half the cost—and waiting times that have also been reduced by 60 percent. We've also implemented this project, this program at the Laredo, Texas, airport, at the Mesa Otay Baja border crossing, and soon this will also be operating in Ciudad Juarez. With projects such as this, we're building a safer, more modern and agile border, a border that undoubtedly generates prosperity for both countries.
Under this framework of competitiveness, we are now celebrating going into effect of the bilateral agreement favoring connectivity between both countries so that as of the moment this agreement goes into effect, we are going to have more flights, more flights that will be better connecting Mexico and the United States.
And today we've also formalized the Energy Business Council to support Mexico's transition towards an open and competitive market. And we said that the issues related to security and migration should be analyzed from an internal, comprehensive perspective under the principle of shared responsibility.
We coincide in the fact that the consumption and fighting consumption in trafficking in heroin is a priority and that we should find solutions to this challenge. We both raised for this. We have created a high-level task force on drugs focused on heroin and fentanyl.
And we've also decided to increase our cooperation with the governments of Central America, especially Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, so that we can look into migration issues, especially the protection of children that are traveling unaccompanied.
Finally, let me refer to the electoral process that's taking place here in the United States. And let me say that the closeness between the United States and Mexico is more than just a relationship between two governments. It is a solid, a sound, unbreakable relationship among millions of peoples who live in both nations. And for Mexicans, for Americans, we are all united by 3,000 kilometers of border with neighboring States—10 neighboring States—and a population of over 50 million inhabitants. And their well-being depends on the well-being of their neighbors. And for the Mexican people, for the Mexican Government, the very good relationship with the United States of America is, of course, essential.
And from now on and right here, let me express my absolute will of collaboration to whomever is elected in November as the leader of this great Nation. The next Madam or President of the United States will find in Mexico and its Government a constructive attitude with proposals and good faith to strengthen the relationship between our two nations.
I am certain, ladies and gentlemen, that the political process in the following months will be characterized by the intensity of the debate and the contrast of ideas and the vitality of the citizens' participation, according to the great democratic tradition that characterizes the United States. The Mexican Government will be observing with great interest the electoral process of this country, but it will not give its opinion. It will not get involved in said process. This is an issue that fully, exclusively corresponds to the people of the United States.
And Mrs. Hillary Clinton and Mr. Donald Trump, I would like to express to both of them my greatest respect, my deepest respect. And from right now, I propose going into a frank, open dialogue with whomever is elected. On the relationship between our two nations, I am sure that with the Government of the United States, it will be possible to take a step ahead so that we can face common challenges and take advantage of our enormous opportunities that we share, of course, and find solutions, solutions for possible differences.
Undoubtedly, for Mexico, it is very important for the United States to do well and for the United States to have a strong economy. And for the United States, it's also very convenient for the Mexican economy to also do well. And your next Madam President or President will find in Mexico a strategic partner to face economic security issues that we share and all the challenges that we share.
I would like to reiterate, President Barack Obama, my appreciation for your hospitality, for this fraternal meeting and for everything, because this is tracing the route and the promise that we can continue working together as sister nations and neighbors. And I reiterate my broadest recognition, President Obama, for being invariably a great friend of Mexico.
Thank you very much.
President Obama. We've got time for a few questions, starting with Kevin Corke [Fox News].
Republican National Convention/Crime Rates/Immigration/The President's Approval Rating
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
President Obama. Yes.
Q. I'm wondering if you had a chance to take in the RNC last night, get your reaction to the comments made by the Republican Presidential nominee. And specifically, how do you counterbalance—as we look ahead to Philadelphia, how do you counterbalance what was clearly an appealing message to many working class Americans?
And I wanted to drill down also on his comments about the wall. He said once again there's a need for a wall. And I ask that question because you and I know that the United States spends tens of millions of dollars on a barrier between our two countries already, so I'm wondering, where does Mr. Trump have it wrong as far as a need for a wall?
And you may also know, sir, that your approval ratings are historically high—congrats on that. And yet your right track, wrong track—about two-thirds of Americans still say we're on a wrong track. Can you sort of square that disconnect? Is it unfair to say that's an indictment of your Presidency? [Laughter]
And, Mr. President, thank you for coming. Two simple questions. One—and you kind of touched on this—Donald Trump very well could be the President in January. How do you work with a person, how do you partner with a person, that you've previously compared to Hitler and Mussolini? And specifically, on antinarcotic interdiction and anti-human trafficking interdiction on the border, are you satisfied with the job that you've done as President? And what should Mexico be doing more of to help stem the tide?
Thank you, gentlemen.
President Obama. Okay. Well, first of all, I want to congratulate the city of Cleveland, Secret Service, local law enforcement that managed a big influx of people and the occasional protestor and just a lot of activity, and made sure that everybody was looked after, everybody was safe. I think they did a great job hosting.
Second, the Republicans had an opportunity this week to share their vision with the country and emphasize those issues that they thought were important. And I'm going to let the American people judge how persuasive their arguments were. Next week, the Democrats will have an opportunity to present their vision of both the progress we've made and how we make sure that everybody gets opportunity and security in the future.
I noticed a little bit of editorializing there, Kevin, when you said, how do I counter a message that was ""clearly appealing to working class Americans."" I don't know if you've talked to all of them. [Laughter]
Q. Only in Ohio. [Laughter]
President Obama. Well, it's the—so it's not really clear how appealing it was. We'll find out. That's what elections are for.
I did not watch the convention. I don't think that's a surprise. I've got a lot of stuff to do—[laughter]—and they are pretty long events. But I did read some of what was said. And the one thing that I think is important to recognize is this idea that America is somehow on the verge of collapse, this vision of violence and chaos everywhere, doesn't really jibe with the experience of most people. I mean, I hope people, the next morning, walked outside and birds were chirping and the sun was out, and this afternoon people will be watching their kids play in sports teams and go to the swimming pool, and folks are going to work and getting ready for the weekend. And in particular, I think it is important just to be absolutely clear here that some of the fears that were expressed throughout the week just don't jibe with the facts.
So let's take two specific examples. When it comes to crime, the violent crime rate in America has been lower during my Presidency than any time in the last three, four decades. And although it is true that we've seen an uptick in murders and violent crime in some cities this year, the fact of the matter is, is that the murder rate today, the violence rate today is far lower than it was when Ronald Reagan was President and lower than when I took office. We've just gone through a tragic period where we saw both a tragedy in Minnesota and Baton Rouge and then the insanity and the viciousness of people targeting police officers. And we are all heartbroken by that, and we're all troubled by how we can rebuild trust, support law enforcement, and make sure that communities feel that they are being fairly policed. But the fact is that the rate of intentional killings of police officers is also significantly lower than it was when Ronald Reagan was President. Now, those are facts. That's the data.
When it comes to immigration, I think Americans expect that our immigration process is orderly and it is legal. And we have put unprecedented resources at our border. Well, it turns out that the rate of illegal migration into the United States today is lower by two-thirds than it was when Ronald Reagan was President. We have far fewer undocumented workers crossing the border today than we did in the eighties or the nineties or when George Bush was President. That's a fact.
So the one thing that I think is important is—obviously, there are going to be different visions about where we should go as a country: How we can provide jobs, how we can make sure that our kids are able to get the education they need to succeed in the 21st century, how do we deal with our budget, how do we make sure our tax system is fair, how do we deal with very real issues around growing inequality or wages that have not gone up as fast as we want and the real pressures that a lot of families feel. But we're not going to make good decisions based on fears that don't have a basis in fact.
And that, I think, is something that I hope all Americans pay attention to. America is much less violent than it was 20, 30 years ago. And immigration is much less a problem than it was not just 20, 30 years ago, but when I came in as President. That doesn't mean we have solved those problems, but those are facts.
I think that covers just about everything—oh, you had some question about my approval ratings being high and right track, wrong track being——
Q. Right track——
President Obama. I think if you look at almost every year, under every President over the last, I don't know, 20, 30 years, you're going to be hard pressed to find a year in which the majority of Americans thought we were on the right track. Maybe because all the good things that are happening in America don't get reported on a lot. So I don't think that's actually unusual. But I appreciate you bringing up the fact that my poll numbers are doing okay. [Laughter]
President Peña Nieto. Thank you very much, President Obama.
Let me reiterate what I said a few minutes ago. The relationship between the United States and Mexico goes over and beyond the relationship between two governments. This is a relationship that has been built as of two peoples who have a common life—or millions of people who have their everyday lives in both nations; a relationship that undoubtedly involves millions of inhabitants of both countries.
I would also like to say, as I've said before, that for the Mexican administration, the democratic process, that you live here in the American Union, and for this process we will always be absolutely respectful. We will not get involved. We will not give our opinion. We will not set any type of position. Because at the end of the day, this corresponds to the people of the United States, and it is the American people who have to decide who the next male or female President will be. But what we can say right now is that whomever is elected here as President, the Mexican Government will be working in a very constructive manner, with good faith. I am certain that the relationship between both countries goes beyond the mere economic environment.
Here, President Obama has highlighted many of the such relevant figures that show the vitality of the economic relationship, the trade and commerce relationship between our two nations, the millions of jobs that are generated in the United States and in Mexico as exactly the economic relationship.
But there's another very important aspect that I should highlight: the good cooperation that we have in terms of security, not only for the Mexican Government to combat organized crime in a more efficient manner, but also for the U.S. Government to efficiently fight criminal groups that practically are not respecting any type of border and that are cooperating in both nations. The cooperation in terms of security between Mexico and the United States is also ever present in the fight against terrorism. We are working so that we can turn North America into a terrorism-free nation and have a part of the world, of course.
And this is something we share every day in this—every day cooperation. We share information. We do activities together. And we are always trying to keep North America as a region free of the presence of terrorism.
The relationship between Mexico and the United States is very broad and at different fronts. That is why the attitude and the position of my administration in terms of committing ourselves to continue working with whomever is elected as President of the United States, it is the decision that—we are going to respect the decision of the American people.
And let me also say that never before have I said anything, have I given any adjective to any of the candidates in the democratic competition here in the United States. Any issue, anything that I have said has been taken out of context. And especially, if we gather everything that has been said on this process, if you see everything that I have said, invariably I have expressed absolute respect for this process, because, I reiterate, this is an issue that's in the decision of the American people, exclusively of the people of the United States.
Trade
Q. Yes. Good afternoon, Mr. Presidents. Both governments have expressed that they are in favor of the free market and globalization. We've heard some voices that oppose themselves to this paradigm. Candidate Trump has pointed out that he is inclined towards protectionism. My question is, do the legal mechanisms of NAFTA provide it with strength so that it is not put aside by decree?
And, President Obama, I'd like to ask you what pending issues you have in your administration that you would have liked to complete? Thank you.
President Peña Nieto. I think the free market model of commercial trade openness, this model has undoubtedly shown enormous benefits for nations, for those of us that follow this model, of course. And let me just say that as of the agreement signed with the United States and Canada—I'm talking about NAFTA, of course—the trade level grew over 500 percent—547 percent to be exact—in this last 20 years of NAFTA. And this undoubtedly is reflected in more productive investments, in the creation of jobs as well. And it has promoted different projects for the development of infrastructure to make our countries even more competitive.
I also think that what is happening is that whenever we've had a slowdown process in the world economy, we start questioning the model, no doubt. However—and this is something I'm fully convinced of—no doubt that this model Mexico has followed and promoted and fostered, well, it has had a particularly important strategic partnership with the U.S. and Canada.
This is a model that still promises a lot of things, so much for the benefits of our citizens, because it allows us to consolidate the North American region as a more competitive region, with a lot more investment, and which we are really taking advantage of opportunities to build labor possibilities for our peoples. This is really something we have to highlight and underline.
And bear in mind, because it represents so much and this agreement is projecting into the future, of course—free trade, of course. Right now we can say that this is something that we have had now for 20 years. And I think there are also conditions to modernize, to update, and to find more advantages so that it will potentiate shared common possibilities that we, the three partners, the three strategic partners, have. I am talking about Mexico, the United States, and Canada.
I believe that this agreement, which is also strengthened through TPP, which is now about to be approved in the different countries, undoubtedly, they potentialize, they boost, and they create a highly promising platform for economic development and for the benefits this will constitute for our societies.
I think the mechanism of solidarity and the purpose—I think the position of the United States is that after 20 years of having NAFTA, we now have eventually the conditions to modernize it, to update NAFTA, and potentialize this agreement even more.
President Obama. I agree with Enrique that one of the values of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP, is that we've learned from our experience in NAFTA what's worked, what hasn't, where we can strengthen it. And a number of the provisions inside of the Trans-Pacific Partnership address some previous criticisms of NAFTA and will make what is already an extraordinarily strong economic relationship between our two countries even stronger and will make sure that the process of global integration is serving not just large companies, but is helping small companies and small businesses and workers.
So what I've said consistently is that globalization is a fact—because of technology, because of an integrated global supply chain, because of changes in transportation. And we're not going to be able to build a wall around that. What we can do is to shape how that process of global integration proceeds so that it's increasing opportunity for ordinary people; so that it's creating better jobs; so that we are strengthening protections for workers; so that we are addressing some of the environmental challenges that come with rapid growth.
And for us to look forward and find ways in which we shape this new direction of the global economy in a way that benefits everybody, rather than to look backwards and think that we can undo what has taken place, I think is our best strategy.
And for all the talk about starting trade wars or increasing protectionist barriers between countries, when you actually examine how our economies work—auto plants in the United States, for example, would have a very hard time producing the number of automobiles they produce—and they've been having record years over the last several years—if they're also not getting some supplies from companies in Mexico. And companies in Mexico are not going to do well if they don't have some connection to not just markets, but also suppliers and technology from the United States.
So we have to focus on, how do we ensure the economy works for everybody and not just a few? There are dangers that globalization increased inequality. There are dangers that because capital is mobile and workers are not, if we are not providing them sufficient protection that they can be left behind in this process. And that's what we have to focus on. And the Trans-Pacific Partnership is consistent with that. Okay?
Juliet Eilperin [Washington Post].
Turkey
Q. President Obama, given the fact that the Government of Turkey is asking for the extradition of Turkish cleric Fethullah Gülen, how are you weighing that decision? How do you view allegations that he helped foment the recent coup and that Turkish intelligence officials have said that they believe U.S. intelligence services had direct knowledge of the coup's planning?
Also, with the detention of more than 10,000 Turks, the firing of thousands more, and a ban on overseas travel by academics there, at what point do you need to speak out more forcefully about these tactics?
And, Señor Presidente, I did my undergraduate thesis on the PRI and the legacy of the revolution and how that shaped your nation's politics.
[At this point, the reporter spoke in Spanish, and no translation was provided. She then continued in English as follows.]
My question for you is that you've mentioned your efforts to address heroin and the trafficking and the transfer to the United States. Could you talk a bit more about the challenges that you face in disrupting this illegal trade, particularly given the fact that often, it's transported in small amounts, making the kind of large busts that Mexico and the U.S. have collaborated on in terms of other illicit drugs more difficult?
And in addition, you, like President Obama, have made climate change a top priority. Can you talk about the biggest obstacles you face there in achieving your climate goals, and how climate impacts are affecting your country and the future relationship between the U.S. and Mexico in terms of migration and other factors? Gracias.
President Obama. So, Juliet, first of all, I had a chance to talk to President Erdogan this week and reiterated what we said from the earliest reports that a coup was being attempted in Turkey, and that is that we strongly reject any attempt to overthrow dem","ocracy in Turkey, that we support the democratically elected government there.
And I think one of the signs of great strength in the Turkish people was the fact that even strong opponents of President Erdogan—when reports of the coup were taking place and when it was still uncertain who exactly was behind it—even opponents of President Erdogan pushed back hard against the idea that the military should overthrow a democratically elected government.
Any reports that we had any previous knowledge of a coup attempt, that there was any U.S. involvement in it, that we were anything other than entirely supportive of Turkish democracy are completely false, unequivocally false. And I said that to President Erdogan. And I also said to him that he needed—he needs to make sure that not just he, but everybody in his Government understand that those reports are completely false. Because when rumors like that start swirling around, that puts our people at risk on the ground in Turkey, and it threatens what is a critical alliance and partnership between the United States and Turkey.
So I want to be as clear and unequivocal as I can be: We deplore the attempted coup. We said so earlier than just about anybody and have been consistent throughout that the Turkish people deserve a government that was democratically elected.
Now, what is true is, is that President Erdogan and Turkey have a strong belief that Mr. Gülen, here in—who is in Pennsylvania, a legal resident of the United States, is somehow behind some of these efforts. And what I said to President Erdogan is the same thing that I would say to you and anybody else who asks, which is, we have a process here in the United States for dealing with extradition requests made by foreign governments. And it's governed by treaties, and it's governed by laws. And it is not a decision that I make, but rather a decision that our Justice Department and investigators and courts make, alongside my administration, in a very well-structured and well-established process.
So the—I told President Erdogan that they should present us with evidence that they think indicates the involvement of Mr. Gülen or anybody else who is here in the United States and it would be processed the way that it is always processed, and that we would certainly take any allegations like this seriously. But America is governed by rules of law, and those are not ones that the President of the United States or anybody else can just set aside for the sake of expediency. Even when we are deeply supportive of Turkish democracy, and even when we care deeply about any attempts to overthrow their Government or any other illegal actions, we've got to go through a legal process.
Finally, with respect to what's happening in the aftermath of the coup attempt, in my conversations with President Erdogan, I think in statements by John Kerry and others, what we have indicated is our strong belief and hope that as the dust settles, there is not a overreaction that could in some fashion lead to a curtailment of civil liberties or a weakening of the ability of legitimate opposition or journalists, through legal processes, to voice their concerns and to petition their Government; and that the United States, as a friend and partner of Turkey's, and me personally, as somebody who has worked with President Erdogan for a long time now, would encourage that the manner in which this coup is investigated and people are held accountable and justice is done is consistent with rule of law and the basic freedoms that I think the Turkish people have fought for and defended.
And obviously, we can't discount how scary and shaken not just the Turkish Government is, but Turkish society is. Imagine if you had some runt group of military officials here in the United States who started flying off with F-16s or other artillery and were taking shots at Government buildings and people were killed and injured. People would be scared and rightfully so. But one of the challenges of a democratic government is making sure that even in the midst of emergencies and passions, we make sure that rule of law and the basic precepts of justice and liberty prevail. And my hope is, is that is what will emerge.
In the meantime, we will continue to work with Turkey, even as they try to stabilize the situation. The—our base at Incirlik, from which we are going after ISIL hard, is up and running again, and we continue to work with them to make sure that we don't lose momentum that we've built in terms of weakening ISIL's position in Syria and to try to strengthen the prospects for some resolution of that terrible conflict.
President Peña Nieto. Thank you very much for your question because it allows us to show and to talk about a subject matter we have agreed and something that I mentioned in my first participation in this meeting—which is exactly that, related to the creation—as a matter of fact, since we met in Canada a few days ago, creating a high-level group to define mechanisms to combat the production of poppy—opium poppy cultivation, and also opium gum and heroin coming into the United States, which is the situation clearly today. What is reality all about? We see that there's a growing production in some parts of the geography of Mexico where there are conditions for the production of this crop. And there's also a growing introduction of heroin here in the United States.
Well, this is the information we have right now. That's why we have to get together to build, we have to continue working together to find a solution to eradicate crops and to have alternative crops, a conversion of crops, and create mechanisms that would allow us to face up to this scourge, which has taken the life of hundreds of people, especially here in the United States.
What we have agreed on is to work together and to define the route we're going to be following. I insist to avoid this poppy crops from extending to other parts of the Mexican geography whenever that is possible and thus be able to reduce, to diminish, to reduce and avoid the growing entrance of heroin in the United States.
But I think this topic shows something else. It shows us the need of working together. It also shows the need both countries have to face up to problems that are common problems. And crops of poppy in Mexico, which is the base for heroin production, undoubtedly is taking place in places where there's a violence as of the production of these crops and criminal groups as well, who have become stronger through the introduction of illegal weapons, guns in our country, guns, firearms coming from the United States into Mexico. Unfortunately, well, this is encouraging—increasingly encouraging—the opium poppy cultivation in Mexico.
I repeat, this is a common problem because it generates a problem of violence in our country and strengthening criminal groups in our country as well and the introduction of heroin here in the United States that has taken the lives of thousands of people in this country.
But what you have said is one of the many subject matters that are on the shared agenda between our two countries, I mean, the need of having and attending to this in a joint fashion. These issues show a need to work in a very close manner, in a constructive manner, in a very positive way to look into this jointly—us, two governments—to look into problems that are affecting both societies.
And this is exactly what we've decided to do. I want to thank President Barack Obama for his political will so that we can create this high-level working group, this task force to find the best solutions for this phenomenon.
Cecilia—[inaudible]—of the Chronicle newspaper.
Mexico-U.S. Relations
Q. Good afternoon, Presidents. You spoke about the need to institutionalize the agreements reached thus far between both nations. Besides the free trade agreement, which is this agenda of subjects taking into account the change in the administration in the United States? I'd like to ask you whether you have discussed the extradition of Chapo Guzmán as well.
President Peña Nieto. When we speak about institutionalizing mechanisms between both countries, it is for them to be durable throughout time. There are three particularly important mechanisms that are undoubtedly—are now allowing us to have a very positive, constructive relationship in both nations. First, the high-level economic dialogue—the HLED—that involves the highest-ranking officials of both our administrations that are working in favor of creating a route, a path for infrastructure, construction of borders, an infrastructure which is a lot more modern infrastructure that will allow to have more agile trade and commerce between our two nations.
And in terms of security, something that I have already said as many of the other subject matters under responsibility, security cooperation allows us to fight together, jointly, criminal organizations operating in both countries, and maintaining a safe border. All comes from this high-level dialogue that we have.
And surely, the academic exchanges, academic exchanges seek to have more students from Mexico to be able to come to the United States to get their training, their education here, and North American students to be able to go to Mexico. And this has been a growing impetus. The number of students, it's 64,000 right now—3 years ago, it was 15,000—Mexican students who are coming here to study in the United States. It is precisely this decision; we've decided to continue on this path and to continue promoting it.
And the third thing here is the mechanism to implement innovation, technology, and infrastructure in North America. This is a mechanism that's allowing us to really identify areas of opportunity; to enhance value chains, productive chains, and also supply chains that are there for the production in the United States as well as in Mexico. In fact, we've already defined a clusters mapping process so that we can really promote the economic activity in both nations and how can we strengthen this relationship, of course. And this is another mechanism generated as of the commitment and the will of President Obama's administration.
So the relationship between our two countries is not a monothematic relationship, just focusing on security. But we wanted to really try to launch efforts in both governments to promote competitiveness and productivity of the United States, of Mexico, of North America as a whole, and to really promote and foster this region so that it can become the most attractive region for investments, economic growth and productivity and development. And for that, we have to be working in common fronts, especially in joint projects that are jointly defined that will also allow us to really comply with this purpose and objective.
President Obama. Let me give a summary of what we mean when we say the need to institutionalize the relationship. I think it's very important to remember that so much of the work that gets done between countries is not done at the level of Presidents, but is done within various agencies, whether it's law enforcement or economic ministries. And when they establish relationships and systems of communications and shared projects and shared visions, those structures continue even after any particular President is gone and build trust and understanding between countries that are critically important.
And this gives me a good opportunity, I think, to emphasize that throughout my Presidency, both with President Peña Nieto and with his predecessor, we have had consistent, strong communications, collaboration. Where there have been differences or tensions, we have consistently tried to work through them in a constructive, positive way.
And to take an example of something that obviously always gets a lot of attention—the issue of the border—a lot of the undocumented workers or migration flows that we've seen over the last several years aren't coming from Mexico, but are coming from Central America. And if it were not for the hard work of Mexico in trying to secure its border to the south and to cooperate with us, we would have a much more significant problem. And that's not always easy. That requires resources and policy decisions made by the Mexican Government. But the cooperation on that front has been absolutely critical in making sure that we deal with these issues in a serious way and in a humane way. And we continue to make progress on that front.
The same is true when it comes to drug trafficking. This is a problem in both of our countries. And as a consequence of the work that we've done together, we have seen progress in some areas, both in the flow of drugs north, but also in the flow of guns and illicit financing south. But we're not going to be able to solve this problem by ourselves. And Mexico is going to need the United States to cooperate in order to rid itself of the violence and corruption that results from the drug trade.
And so the more we can build these kinds of habits of cooperation and ingrain them in our various agencies, the better off we're going to be. And I want everybody to be very clear: Mexico has been a consistent, strong partner with us on these issues. And if they had not been, we would have had much bigger problems on our borders. And the benefit of a cooperative Mexico—and by the way, a Mexico that has a healthy economy, a Mexico that can help us build stability and security in Central America—that's going to do a lot more to solve any migration crisis or drug trafficking problem than a wall. And it will be much more reflective of the kind of relationship that we should have with our neighbors. Okay?
Mr. President, thank you.
President Peña Nieto. Thank you. Thank you so much."
"October 18, 2016",The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy,Barack Obama,"Barack Obama, The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/319145",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-matteo-renzi-italy,"President Obama. Please, everybody, have a seat. Salve. Once again, I want to welcome Prime Minister Renzi and his delegation back to the White House. As we all saw this morning, Matteo's English is much better than my Italian. Michelle and I are looking forward to hosting Matteo and Agnese at tonight's state dinner. But as I believe our Italian friends say, prima il dovere, poi il piacere—[laughter]—which means ""first duty, then pleasure."" Tonight's dinner will be a pleasure. Today we're focused on our duties: our work to advance the security and the prosperity of our peoples.
I want to begin by once again expressing our deep gratitude, as Americans, for the extraordinary alliance with Italy. The United States is lucky to have many strong allies around the world. Few are as strong and as reliable and as capable as Italy. In good times and in bad, we can count on each other. And I want to thank the Government and the people of Italy for the hospitality and the generosity they show to the many American military personnel and families who are stationed in Italy, far away from home.
Matteo, please also know that our thoughts continue to be with the people of Amatrice. And I know that you're still working closely with local governments there to recover and rebuild from the devastating earthquake that took place this summer.
In our work together over the past 2 years, I've come to count on Prime Minister Renzi as one of my closest partners and friends on the world stage. By virtue of his progressive vision, his energy, the reforms that he's pursuing—which are sweeping—the bold vision that he has for Italy and the world, I think Matteo embodies a new generation of leadership, not just for Italy, but also for Europe. And this is critically important because, as I've said repeatedly over the last several years, a strong and united and confident and prosperous Europe, anchored in liberal traditions and democracy and rights, that's a necessity for the United States, and it's a necessity for the world. It's a strategic interest of ours that we have a successful, united Europe. And today we focused on a number of key challenges facing Europe, our trans-Atlantic alliance, and the globe.
On the economic front, we agree that our focus has to remain on growth, creating jobs and prosperity for our people. Matteo has been pursuing some very bold economic reforms, structural reforms in Italy that are not easy, that are often resisted by existing institutions and inertia. But the Italian economy has shown signs of growth. It still has a long way to go to put Italy on a path to long-term and sustainable growth. And the upcoming referendum to modernize Italy's political institutions are something the United States strongly supports because we believe that it will help accelerate Italy's path towards a more vibrant, dynamic economy, as well as a more responsive political system.
Matteo shared his thoughts on how, in the wake of Brexit, the European Union can move forward and focus on delivering security and prosperity that Europeans deserve. And we both agreed that without an emphasis on demand and growth, and investment in infrastructure and projects that can put people back to work—particularly young people—that much of the economic fragility in Europe will continue. And by the way, that has an impact around the world, including on the American economy as well. We both reaffirmed our strong support for negotiations around the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which can support jobs and exports and innovation and growth on both sides of the Atlantic.
We talked about, as NATO allies, our unified determination to defend every ally and to continue to strengthen NATO's defense and deterrence posture. Italy will be a key contributor to NATO's Joint Task Force, which is now operational and can deploy anywhere in Europe on short notice. We discussed our shared concerns around the situation in Ukraine and the importance of keeping sanctions, including EU sanctions, in place until Russia and Ukraine are both implementing commitments under the Minsk agreement. And we are determined to work diplomatically with the Normandy Group in order to achieve that goal.
I thanked Italy very strongly for its leading role in the coalition against ISIL. After the United States, Italy is the second largest contributor of forces in Iraq. Italian forces are helping to stabilize cities through its training of police after they are liberated from ISIL. The start of Iraqi operations to liberate Mosul is another major step forward. Mosul, as many of you know, is Iraq's second largest city, and ISIL has been entrenched there for more than 2 years. Perhaps a million civilians are still living there. And so, in addition to rooting out ISIL, our focus jointly is on the safety and the humanitarian aid for civilians who are escaping the fight. That's going to be a top priority for both our governments.
My—Mosul will be a difficult fight, and there will be advances and there will be setbacks. But I am confident that just as ISIL has been defeated in communities across Iraq, ISIL will be defeated in Mosul as well, and that will be another step towards their ultimate destruction. Meanwhile, Italy continues to be one of our strongest counterterrorism partners as we work together to prevent terrorist attacks in our countries.
More broadly, we agreed to continue our strong support of the Libyan Government of National Accord, which, as we've seen in recent days, continues to face challenges to its authority. Italy provided critical diplomatic support to Libya's efforts to forge the Government. Together, we intend to continue to support the Government of National Accord as it works to eject ISIL from Libya, provide stability and services throughout the country. And as ISIL tries to expand its presence in Afghanistan, Italy continues to play a vital role as we train and assist Afghan forces and support Afghan development.
We discussed the continued need for strong, coordinated responses to the largest migrant and refugee crisis in Europe since World War II. As the leader of EU's naval operation in the Mediterranean, Italy and its partners have helped to save hundreds of thousands of lives. As NATO agreed in Warsaw, the alliance is moving ahead with plans to increase its support of these EU operations. And, Matteo, I want to commend you and the Italian people. For the leadership in Europe that you have shown as an eloquent voice for a collective, orderly, and humane response to this crisis is in keeping with our values and our shared commitment to human dignity.
And finally, the past two weeks have been a powerful reminder that when our countries work together we can leave the world a little bit better than we found it. Because the United States and Italy joined with other nations across the globe, we've brought the Paris Agreement on climate change into force. We reached an agreement to limit aviation emissions. And through the Montreal Protocol, nearly 200 nations just this past week agreed to phase down production and consumption of dangerous hydrofluorocarbons, which are a enormous contributor to greenhouse gases and a major step towards achieving the goals that we set in Paris. Meanwhile, Italy continues to be a strong partner for development, especially to combat hunger and malnutrition around the world.
So, once again, Matteo, thank you for your friendship. Thank you for your partnership. I could not ask for a better partner. And the American people could not ask for a better friend and ally than Italy. So grazie.
Prime Minister Renzi. I'm not sure your Italian is worse than my English because——
President Obama. It's slower anyway.
Prime Minister Renzi. ——you improve very quickly, your Italian.
Mr. President, grazie mille.
[At this point, Prime Minister Renzi spoke in Italian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Prime Minister Renzi. Thank you. Thank you kindly for the reception. What we said about the great honor which is here today for Italy is something I'd like to confirm, is something that I'd like to underline with great strength. But as President Obama said, our meeting was also an occasion to talk about our duties, and after that, to talk about pleasure.
In those topics that have to do with our political times, I want to thank the United States of America for the extraordinary support for the battle that Italy is having in our country, within Europe to affirm a paradigm of growth and not only of austerity at all levels. The United States are a model in this sense, 2008-2016. Constantly, your country has indicated, shown us the way of how to get out of the biggest crisis after the war. I believe that Europe can and should do more. Italy considers the American example as the reference point in this battle.
Of course, we also know that we have to do our homework at home, the structural reforms. And therefore, what the President just reminded us of is the priorities, starting with the labor market reform.
I had to ask for his forgiveness because I used the expression, ""Jobs Act,"" which is obviously something that I copied. But this is something that is open source, and I think that we can copy each other's expressions from the great initiatives that were set forth by the Obama Presidency. This has created 588,000 new jobs in Italy, which for Italy are still insufficient, but at least they are a first step to leave our difficult situation.
Thank you, President Obama, for the work you've done as a leader in the energy field. Today, Italy is one of the main nations that sustains and upholds the vision of COP 21 in Paris. We will be working in Marrakesh in November. The next few years, we will be working in this direction in order to have clean energy, sustainable environment for our children.
And thank you for the work that we've done together in the field of culture—in the cultural field. I believe that we find ourselves in a season of our political lives. Maybe some people choose hatred, the culture of intolerance. We have to bet on liberty. We have to bet on our identity, the values that make this country extraordinary. And Europe—Europe has a desperate need to find its own soul. And this is due to its children. This is due to its grandchildren. So this is the first topic of conversation that we had with President Obama.
In terms of Italy, we want to make sure that the G-7, in Taormina, in Italy, in the beautiful Sicily is an important, a relevant appointment, and we commit ourselves, because the work that we began together, dear President, under your Presidency may continue. The legacy of President Obama not—will not only remain in the United States. This has to be absolutely clear and absolutely loud. It will involve the Europe, and we feel totally committed in this direction.
And finally, before I talk about international policies, I want to tell you that we thank you for remembering Amatrice. Amatrice is a small village in the center of Italy which has been affected by a dramatic earthquake. It's also the town where pasta all'Amatriciana was born. This is one of the typical products of Italy. And so this small community at Amatrice that had so many dead has not left its courage.
Dear President, when you come to visit Italy in the next few months, I believe that we will want you to taste, thanks to the cooks in Amatrice, one of the best pastas that you have ever tried in your life, particularly pasta all'Amatriciana. I think that this is a way of saying to this community—where a community that has been folded by this terrible tragedy—that food can be an element of identity in the future.
In terms of our international policies, the Italian agenda is in agreement with the American agenda. We are thoroughly convinced of the need to affirm values of being able to live together, of being civil throughout the world. That's why we commit ourselves to work with the international coalition in all theaters, starting in Iraq, in Mosul, where Italian troops are supporting an operation to save the dam in Mosul. And we believe that it's fundamental, it's crucial not to succumb to the culture of fear. In the future, we cannot know what will happen, but if there's a great inheritance left by the American Dream, this is the best way to proceed.
Recently, a lot has been said about innovation and technology, and this has made people think that the future is a threat. I am completely convinced that in Italy and the United States we can help the new generations to think of the future not only of—think of this as a great opportunity. And for this reason, the agenda that the United States has presented today is an agenda that we agreed upon and we will be working together on it.
Thank you so much, Mr. President.
President Obama. Okay, we're going to take a few questions. And I will start with Kevin Freking of AP.
Russia-U.S. Relations/Republican Presidential Nominee Donald J. Trump/Federal Bureau of Investigation/Department of State 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton talks too tough about Vladimir Putin and that both of you insult the Russian leader. He also said that, if elected, he might meet with the Russian leader before his Inauguration. What do you think of Trump's approach to Putin? And how would it affect America's interest on the international stage?
Secondly——
President Obama. I can still hear.
Q. Secondly, does it distress you that folks at the FBI and State Department talked about the proper level of classification of e-mails that were on Secretary Clinton's server? Would you acknowledge the appearance of impropriety? And should State Department officials look into this further?
And for Prime Minister Renzi, with the critical governing referendum happening soon in your country, what would passage mean for your ability to lead that country? And what would failure mean to your political future, as well as to Italy's role in the European Union? President Obama. Well, I'm going to be a little more subdued in my discussions of the Republican nominee in this context than I might be on the campaign trail. But let me just speak broadly about Russia.
When I came into office, Russia, under the previous administration, had invaded parts of Georgia, had created a frozen conflict there. There was a new President, and we tried to initiate a more constructive path with respect to U.S.-Russia relations. And I think we showed Russia plenty of respect, acknowledging enormous differences and different values, but also trying to find ways in which we could cooperate together.
We initiated the New START Treaty. We assisted Russia with respect to its ascension to the WTO. We worked on some common international challenges together. And when the previous President was replaced with Mr. Putin, I met with him and we discussed again ways in which we could constructively work together.
The challenge that we've had with Russia is very much centered on Russian aggression in some very particular areas around the world. In Ukraine, where they have engaged in similar conduct to what they did in Georgia, and even there, we've tried to broker, and work with the Europeans to broker, a Minsk agreement that would peacefully resolve those issues.
In Syria, one of my earliest meetings with Putin was to suggest to him that if Asad stayed in power, given the brutality with which he had treated his own people, you would see a civil war that would not be good for the Syrians, certainly, but would not be good for the world anywhere. Rather than to work with us to try to solve the problem, he doubled down on his support for Asad, and we know the situation that exists there.
So any characterization that somehow we have improperly challenged Russian aggression or have somehow tried to encroach on their legitimate interests is just wrong. And Mr. Trump's continued flattery of Mr. Putin and the degree to which he appears to model many of his policies and approaches to politics on Mr. Putin is unprecedented in American politics, and is out of step with not just what Democrats think, but out of step with what, up until the last few months, almost every Republican thought, including some of the ones who are now endorsing Mr. Trump.
So you'll have to explain to me how it is that some of the same leaders of the Republican Party who were constantly haranguing us for even talking to the Russians and who consistently took the most hawkish approaches to Russia—including Mr. Trump's selection for Vice President—now reconcile their endorsement of Mr. Trump with their previous views.
The bottom line is, is that we think that Russia is a large, important country with a military that is second only to ours, and has to be a part of the solution on the world stage rather than part of the problem. But their behavior has undermined international norms and international rules in ways that we have to call them out on. And anybody who occupies this office should feel the same way, because these are values that we fought for and we protected.
We can't go around talking about human rights or freedom of the press or democracy or freedom of religion or nondiscrimination or basic laws of war or the sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries no matter how small and then extoll the virtues of somebody who violates those principles.
And Mr. Trump rarely surprises me these days. I'm much more surprised and troubled by the fact that you have Republican officials who, historically, have been adamantly anti-Russian and, in fact, have attacked me for even engaging them diplomatically, now supporting and, in some cases, echoing, his positions. It's quite a reversal. You'll have to ask them how to explain it.
With respect to the State Department and the FBI reports, I think you've heard directly from both the FBI and the State Department that the notion or the accounts that have been put out there are just not true. And you can question them again, but based on what we have seen, heard, learned, some of the more sensational implications or appearances, as you stated them, aren't based on actual events and based on what actually happened and, I think, derive from sort of overly broad characterizations of interactions between the State Department and the FBI that happen a lot and happen between agencies.
I think that covers me.
Prime Minister Renzi. What the forum—I know 2016 is not a very good year to organize a referendum. But I think the Italian referendum is very simply a message because it's about the fight against bureaucracy. And we need a great investment against bureaucracy in Italy for a lot of reasons. We changed 63 governments in 70 years. A few times, we joke about it with the President, because it's unbelievable in a country to have a government change 1 year—every year. But it's normal. The discussion, the political discussion is very strong.
My opinion is very easy. If in December we will win this referendum for Italy, it will be easy—more easy to continue the battle to change Europe, because structural reforms are important for Italy, but are important also for institutions in Brussels—in Europe.
So the only consequence, constitutional reform apart, in the political debate in my view is, if we win, Italy will be stronger in the debate in EU. And so I work strongly and hardly to achieve the victory.
Ah, sorry. Platero, Sole 24 Ore.
Q. Grazie.
Prime Minister Renzi. You're American, not Italian.
Q. I'm American; I'm Italian.
Prime Minister Renzi. American citizens.
Q. I will ask the question in English—or in Italian.
Prime Minister Renzi. Okay.
[A reporter spoke in Italian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
U.S. Economy/European Union 
So let's talk about the referendum, because you hope to win, of course. But we've found many investors at Wall Street who are worried about the fact that you might lose the referendum. These are investors that have faith in Italy and that threaten, if there is a negative result in terms of the reforms, to just leave. So what can you tell these investors in order to reassure them to—if there is a negative outcome, will you stay on? Will you continue with the reforms?
And one last thing. This evening, will you bring some wine to the dinner with the President? This is an Italian custom.
[The reporter spoke in English as follows.] Q. I agree with the Prime Minister, your accent is beautiful, truly beautiful.
The President. Grazie.
Q. So your Italian accent, of course.
The President. I've got my hands to—grazie. [Laughter]
Q. Yes. On growth, you seem to be in agreement that there is a need to sort of go ahead with the policy that you have pursued on being more flexible on the fiscal side. The problem is that Brussels is very rigid about it. And it's very rigid with the Italian efforts, therefore jeopardizing these efforts. What can you say to Brussels, especially after Brexit—they don't seem to be moving on that front—how important it is to move forward in that direction? And do you think that in case the referendum will not go well for the Prime Minister, he should stay on and continue in his reforms? Thank you.
[Prime Minister Renzi spoke in Italian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Prime Minister Renzi. I have a feeling— and I think that rightly so—our American friends are a little bit more interested in November 8 than in the Italian vote on constitutional reform. And so are we, might I add.
But in terms of what you were asking, very, very briefly, this is a time in which many investors throughout the world are coming back to invest in Italy. We're extremely happy about this. We're happy about the investments on innovation in terms of technology. Apple is investing in Naples. Amazon is going to open an artificial intelligence center in Turin. So for the entire economic and financial world, well, they're starting to see Italy as an area in which to create opportunities and business, therefore, open doors.
I don't believe that there will be any major disasters if the ""no"" wins at the referendum. But in order to have no doubts, I'd rather win the referendum. I'll do everything I can do; this atavistic doubt will not be able to come about. But what is fundamental, what is true is that the message goes through. This referendum does not have to do with the great world events, the great world issues. Very simply: Do you want to simplify the institutional system in Italy, giving greater stability and certain times in which to have greater stability? This is something to simply things in our country.
And based on the question that was asked to the President on Europe, we do respect the European rules, and we're totally inside the European rules, although sometimes we do this halfheartedly. We'd like to do things differently. But so long as rules don't change, we will respect them, because Italy has made of its reputation one of the key words in its mandate. We work to change them, but if they're there, we are going to respect them.
Now, what will happen within the next few months will be seen, as a great singer—Italian singer says—we will discover this by living. So I'm almost certain that the ""yes"" will win so you will have no grounds to ask this question.
President Obama. During the course of my Presidency, I have had repeated conversations with Brussels, with Angela, with François, and others around how we could most effectively recover from the crisis of 2007, 2008. It is fair to say that we have made more progress more quickly. And what I've tried to point out was, the reason we were able to make progress was, we focused very early on in providing a large infusion of demand through our fiscal policies: rebuilding roads, bridges; investing in schools, teachers, clean energy; putting people back to work; tax cuts, put money into pockets of consumers; saving the auto industry. But then, also, what was very important was quickly trying to fix the banks and infusing capital and making sure they were more stable, more transparent, and would attract confidence so that the financial system was working again.
And look, I'm proud of our economic track record. We have grown faster and created more jobs and, this past year, seen incomes rise and poverty fall more quickly than a lot of our counterparts in Europe.
Now, I recognize that Europe is a more complicated collection of states and it's more difficult to move and some are in the euro zone and some are not. And so I don't expect that everything we've done can immediately translate to Europe. And there's some parts of what Europe does that we could learn from in terms of the social safety net, for example.
But what I do know is that given the very slow growth that's taken place in Europe, or contraction, over what is almost a decade now, you have a generation of European youth who are not attaching themselves to the labor market fast enough. And if you don't reverse some of those trends, then it becomes a generational loss of income, of wealth, of economic dynamism.
And now that countries like Italy and others have made real progress on their finances and their deficits and there's more market confidence in their position, now would be a good time, I believe, to refocus attention on growth and making investments. Because one of the reasons that we've been able to cut our deficits by two-thirds is not simply because we cut spending by two-thirds. We disciplined spending, but we also grew fast enough that more revenue came in. And that's one of the best ways for you to arrive at a sound fiscal position.
And monetary policy alone is not sufficient. I think Mario Draghi and the European Central Bank have done good work trying to maintain a positive trajectory in Europe. But ultimately, there's only so much monetary policy can do if it's not combined with fiscal policy. And my hope would be that—Matteo is right, Italy has been true to its word in Europe and met its obligations—but my hope would be, the debate broadens as Europe moves forward around how to grow more quickly, put more people back to work, see incomes rise, create a greater sense of momentum and optimism. Because I do believe that there is a connection between stagnation and some of the less constructive populist impulses that have been rising up.
And those trend lines about Europe do concern me, because if you look at the European experiment over the last 40 years—I said this in Hannover—there's probably been no group of people who have enjoyed more prosperity and more peace over the last several decades than a united Europe. If it begins now splintering because their sense is, the global capitals and elites are not attentive to the ordinary concerns of people, that would be a tragedy. And my hope is that that discussion, led by Matteo and others, will continue.
And by the way, yes, I think if—I won't weigh in on the referendum, but the reforms Matteo is initiating, certainly on the economic side, are the right ones. And in a global, Internet-driven world, governments have to be able to move fast and quickly and transparently. And so I am rooting for success, but I think you should hang around for a while no matter what.
Ayesha Rascoe [Reuters]. 2016 Presidential Election/U.S. Electoral System/Republican Presidential Nominee Donald J. Trump/Iraq/Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) Terrorist Organization 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to ask you about the election. Donald Trump is telling his supporters that the election is rigged and asking them to monitor certain areas on election day. How concerned are you about the potential for violence? And what about after election day, are you worried the results of the election may be distrusted?
And for Prime Minister Renzi, the offensive in Mosul has begun. Are you concerned about what happens after liberation? And, Mr. President, if you want to weigh in on that as well, I'd appreciate it.
President Obama. I do.
Q. Thanks.
President Obama. Okay. One of the great things about America's democracy is, we have a vigorous, sometimes bitter, political contest. And when it's done, historically, regardless of party, the person who loses the election congratulates the winner, reaffirms our democracy, and we move forward. That's how democracy survives, because we recognize that there is something more important than any individual campaign, and that is making sure that the integrity and trust in our institutions sustains itself. Because democracy, by definition, works by consent, not by force.
I have never seen in my lifetime or in modern political history any Presidential candidate trying to discredit the elections and the election process before votes have even taken place. It's unprecedented. It happens to be based on no facts. Every expert, regardless of political party, regardless of ideology—conservative or liberal—who has ever examined these issues in a serious way will tell you that instances of significant voter fraud are not to be found; that, keep in mind, elections are run by State and local officials, which means that there are places like Florida, for example, where you've got a Republican Governor whose Republican appointees are going to be running and monitoring a whole bunch of these election sites. The notion that somehow if Mr. Trump loses Florida, it's because of those people that you have to watch out for, that is both irresponsible, and by the way, it doesn't really show the kind of leadership and toughness that you'd want out of a President.
If you start whining before the game is even over, if whenever things are going badly for you and you lose, you start blaming somebody else, then you don't have what it takes to be in this job. Because there are a lot of times when things don't go our way or my way. That's okay. You fight through it, you work through it. You try to accomplish your goals.
But the larger point that I w","ant to emphasize here is that there is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America's elections, in part because they're so decentralized and the numbers of votes involved. There's no evidence that that has happened in the past or that there are instances in which that will happen this time.
And so I'd advise Mr. Trump to stop whining and go try to make his case to get votes. And if he got the most votes, then it would be my expectation of Hillary Clinton to offer a gracious concession speech and pledge to work with him in order to make sure that the American people benefit from an effective Government. And it would be my job to welcome Mr. Trump, regardless of what he's said about me or my differences with him on my opinions, and escort him over to the Capitol, in which there would be a peaceful transfer of power. That's what Americans do. That's why America is already great. One way of weakening America and making it less great is if you start betraying those basic American traditions that have been bipartisan and have helped to hold together this democracy now for well over two centuries.
With respect to Mosul, we are seeing the Iraqi forces, with the support of the coalition that includes the United States and Italy and other nations, moving forward and encircling Mosul. The intention is to drive ISIL out of what was its first major urban stronghold and what continues to be one of the key organizational and logistical and leadership hubs for ISIL.
I'm confident that we can succeed, although it's going to be a tough fight and a difficult fight. It is Iraqis who are doing the fighting. And they are performing effectively and bravely and taking on significant casualties. There will be ups and downs in this process, but my expectation is, is that ultimately it will be successful. And this will be, I think, a key milestone in what I committed to doing when ISIL first emerged, which was, we were going to roll them back and we are going to ultimately drive them out of population centers and we will destroy them and defeat them so that they are not in a position to carry out terrorist attacks against our peoples or our friends and allies or against innocent people inside of Iraq and Syria. And we've seen just steady progress on this front.
Now, you ask a very important question, which is, if in fact we are successful, how do we deal with what could be a humanitarian crisis? Because ISIL, when it occupies these territories, it bleeds them dry. It feeds off them. It oppresses the local populations. It's not very good at governance. And so just basic functions like electricity or water start running down. People are fleeing from their homes. There will be significant displacement.
This has all been part of the coalition planning process in conjunction with the United Nations, in conjunction with major aid organizations. And so we have put together plans and infrastructure for dealing with a potential humanitarian crisis that are as extensive as the military plans. That doesn't mean that we don't have to pay attention to it. And executing will be difficult; it's going to still be a tough environment to operate under. And no doubt, there will be instances where we see some heartbreaking situations if in fact large numbers of people flee. It's hard when you leave your home. It's hard when you leave your home and you already didn't have a lot because you were living under an oppressive barbarous regime. It's hard to leave your home in a war zone.
So it's not something that I expect will be easy, but I think it perhaps hasn't been publicized enough, at least in the American press, the degree of planning and assets and resources that we're devoting to this very important problem. Because if we aren't successful in helping ordinary people as they're fleeing from ISIL, then that makes us vulnerable to seeing ISIL return and feeding on the resentments in the aftermath of Mosul being liberated. And so there's a strategic, as well as humanitarian, interest in us getting that right. Okay?
Prime Minister Renzi. I think about Mosul, the considerations of President are very clear. For Italian side, we are particularly committed about dam. There is a dam—a dangerous dam—and we support an Italian company who will work to restore the dam, because it could be a great problem for the population.
And for the rest, we are totally engaged with the rest of coalition to ensure to the Iraqi people the possibility to have a future. And let me be very great [grateful; White House correction.] to the Italian Army, particularly Italian Carabinieri, who provide in this country to learning the local police. So we are not worried for the future if we will bring Mosul because we think sooner or later that we will destroy Daesh. And the reconstruction and the rebuilding will be a priority for every member of international community. Italy is engaged in the work with the United States and the other alliance.
Last. Prego, l'ultima. Last—[inaudible].
Q. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. In italiano e anzi in inglese.
[The reporter asked a question in English as follows.]
European Migration Crisis/Libya/Central American Migration to the U.S./European Union 
Q. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. The Mediterranean represents a geopolitical priority for Italy, mainly because of the constant flow of migrants. And is there common strategies on this and common strategies on Libya? And can Italy act as a bridge between Europe and Africa? And how American administration can help the efforts of the Italian Government, because Europe sometimes leave alone Italy to face the challenge? Thank you.
[Prime Minister Renzi spoke in Italian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Prime Minister Renzi. I'm going to answer in Italian for the first channel, TG1. Obviously, our position is always the same one. Europe has to be more convinced and look toward Africa with more conviction. And from this stance, we can't go every time to ask for help to the United States without doing our part. The United States are busy in all the international theaters. And the ones that are closer to us, we obviously need the support of our best friend, because the United States are this: our best friend.
But we also have to start an Italian and European strategy. We can't always just sit and wait for this type of support. Therefore, the issue of the Mediterranean and Africa has been left aside during the last 10 years in the European Union. We have to give it priority again. We have to work as the Commission had foreseen it would do. But it's not doing it with the necessary speed, and we will do whatever we can with the agreements with certain states, with the five states that are our priority. We have to work for Africa to be a priority, including a priority from the point of view of resources, local development.
We will talk about this during the G-7 in Sicily next year. And in terms of investments, the political investment—which perhaps in the last few years has been sorely lacking—before asking for help for—from the United States, which is something we gladly do, Italy and Europe have to do their part. Italy will increase its efforts for international cooperation in the ranking of G-7 for international cooperation. We were the last in the classification, seven—the seventh in the position, the list of seven. It's not a good position. But we will reach the fourth place in the ranking in terms of GDP, which each of us proposes.
So we have an increase in terms of the money in international cooperation, in funds. And in terms of Libya, you know that we are working. We want to stabilize the Government. We want to make sure that there is a block of all these brothers and sisters that leave their country. Every time they go to sea, they risk dying. We're happy and we're very proud to help save lives. But the ocean is one of the worst places to do that. But we don't want the Mediterranean to become a cemetery, so we have to have a long-term strategy. We spoke about this. And we have to have short-term strategies as well. We're very proud of what we're doing, but we know that this method cannot go on forever. We cannot think of being in charge by ourselves of all the problems of Libya and Africa. And from this stance, in the—on Thursday and Friday, at the European Council, we will talk about this.
President Obama. [Inaudible]—extensive topic of conversation. Let me just make a few points. Number one, it is a strategic interest of the United States to make sure that the migration crisis that's been taking place in Europe is solved. It's a strategic interest because of the terrible loss of life that we see as people attempt to reach Europe, but also because of the distorting effects that it can have on European politics if the sense is that the influx of migration is disorderly, chaotic, and overwhelms European countries. And so we are deeply committed in Europe's success in resolving this issue effectively.
Now, obviously, there are a lot of contributors to it. So we are very focused on strengthening the Government of National Accord, as I indicated. And Secretary John Kerry and others are working with his counterparts on a multilateral basis to strengthen the Government of National Accord, resolve tensions that exist between the different portions of Libya, and then to be able to invest and build in their capacity to control their borders and their waterways. Because if we don't have a partner on the other side of the ocean, it's going to continue to be a problem. That's point number one.
Point number two: We are deeply appreciative of the generosity and humanitarian impulses of the Italian people in rescuing so many people through Operation Sophia. What we did in Warsaw during the NATO meeting was to indicate that although that is primarily a EU mission, NATO and the United States and our naval assets are prepared to assist in a robust way where appropriate. And it's just a matter of coordinating with Europe to find out—and Italy and other countries—what it is that you need, we will help. The same way that we do with respect to helping to enforce the agreement between Turkey and the European Union on that portion, that body of water.
The third point, as Matteo pointed out, is more long term, and that is, trying to help these countries that are having difficulties, where people feel either unstable, insecure, or just hungry and in search of opportunity. How do we help them develop in such a way where people feel that they can succeed and raise their families without fleeing to more developed countries? That is a longer term proposition, but we have to begin to make the investments now.
I mentioned to Matteo, we have obviously different issues with respect to migration. And net migration into this country has actually been flat—in some cases, even decreased—or we've seen reverse flows, particularly with respect to Mexico. But one area where we have seen a big spike over the last several years is actually from the smaller countries in Central America where the economy is doing poorly; agriculture has done poorly, in part because of changing weather patterns; violence brought on by narcotraffickers.
So Vice President Biden, I gave him the charge of working with those countries to come up with a development plan. Congress, on a bipartisan basis, supported us putting more money into these countries for development, more effective policing, dealing with fighting the narcotraffickers in a more effective way, investing in young people. But that's not going to happen overnight. That will be a decade-long process, potentially.
In the meantime, we insist that those countries cooperate with us to send a message to the populations that it is a dangerous trip to reach the United States, and if you get here, you're likely to be turned back, to try to discourage a dangerous—this dangerous passage but also to try to undermine the human traffickers who are preying on the desperation of these people to make money.
So all those strategies have to be employed. And the one thing I would encourage is—and I've said this whenever I've visited Europe—you can't have a situation where Italy, Greece, Germany are bearing the entire burden. If in fact you have a European Union, then you're unified not just for the benefits, but also for the costs. And I do think it is important for Europe collectively to be invested in solving this problem and not just leave it to one country, in the same way that here in the United States, obviously, it's—we're an actual nation-state as opposed to a union of separate states. But we would not abandon one State and just say, here, you deal with an entire problem and good luck with that. Right? If we have solidarity and benefit from that solidarity on a whole range of issues, then that means you also have joint responsibilities. Okay?
Q. Sir, on Central American, numbers have actually increased——
President Obama. That's what I just said. I said Central America, they've increased, David [David Nakamura, Washington Post]. Why——
Q. I was wondering if you could comment about whether—what that says about policy—[inaudible].
President Obama. No, actually, David, they went—they spiked heavily in 2014, went down significantly in 2015, have gone back up this year, in part because there's still desperation in Central America, but are still not at the levels they were in 2014.
But I appreciate you shouting out a question, since I'm sure there are a lot of other colleagues of yours who would want to do the same. [Laughter]
Thank you very much, everybody. Appreciate it."
"November 14, 2016",The President's News Conference,Barack Obama,"Barack Obama, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/319671",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1140,"The President. Hello, everybody. In a couple hours, I'll be departing on my final foreign trip as President. And while we're abroad, I'll have a chance to take a few of your questions, but I figured why wait? I know that there's a lot of domestic issues that people are thinking about, so I wanted to see if I could clear out some of the underbrush so that when we're overseas and people are asking about foreign policy questions, people don't feel obliged to tack on three other questions to them.
Q. We still will.
The President. Let me—I know you still will, yes. [Laughter] That I'm aware of, but I'm trying something out here. First of all, let me mention three brief topics.
First of all, as I discussed with the President-elect on Thursday, my team stands ready to accelerate in the next steps that are required to ensure a smooth transition. And we are going to be staying in touch as we travel. I remember what it was like when I came in 8 years ago. It is a big challenge. This office is bigger than any one person. And that's why ensuring a smooth transition is so important.
It's not something that the Constitution explicitly requires, but it is one of those norms that are vital to a functioning democracy, similar to norms of civility and tolerance and a commitment to reason and to facts and analysis. It's part of what makes this country work. And as long as I'm President, we are going to uphold those norms and cherish and uphold those ideals.
As I've told my staff, we should be very proud that their work has already ensured that when we turn over the keys, the car is in pretty good shape. We are indisputably in a stronger position today than we were when I came in 8 years ago. Jobs have been growing for 73 straight months. Incomes are rising. Poverty is falling. The uninsured rate is at the lowest level on record. Carbon emissions have come down without impinging on our growth.
And so my instructions to my team are that we run through the tape. We make sure that we finish what we started, that we don't let up in these last couple of months, because my goal is, on January 21, America is in the strongest position possible and, hopefully, there's an opportunity for the next President to build on that.
Number two, our work has also helped to stabilize the global economy. And because there is one President at a time, I'll spend this week reinforcing America's support for the approaches that we've taken to promote economic growth and global security on a range of issues.
I look forward to my first visit in Greece. And then, in Germany, I'll visit with Chancellor Merkel, who's probably been my closest international partner these past 8 years. I'll also signal our solidarity with our closest allies and express our support for a strong, integrated, and united Europe. It's essential to our national security, and it's essential to global stability. And that's why the transatlantic alliance and the NATO alliance have endured for decades under Democratic and Republican administrations. Finally, in Peru, I'll meet with the leaders of countries that have been the focus of our foreign policy through our rebalance in the Asia-Pacific. This is a time of great change in the world. But America has always been a pillar of strength and a beacon of hope to peoples around the globe. And that's what it must continue to be.
Finally, on a personal note, Michelle and I want to offer our deepest condolences to Gwen Ifill's family and to all of you, her colleagues, on her passing. Gwen was a friend of ours. She was an extraordinary journalist. She always kept faith with the fundamental responsibilities of her profession: asking tough questions, holding people in power accountable, and defending a strong and free press that makes our democracy work.
I always appreciated Gwen's reporting, even when I was at the receiving end of one of her tough and thorough interviews. Whether she reported from a convention floor or from the field, whether she sat at the debate moderator's table or at the anchor's desk, she not only informed today's citizens, but she also inspired tomorrow's journalists. She was an especially powerful role model for young women and girls who admired her integrity, her tenacity, and her intellect, and for whom she blazed a trail as one-half of the first all-female anchor team on network news.
So Gwen did her country a great service. Michelle and I join her family and her colleagues, and everybody else who loved her in remembering her fondly today.
So with that, I'm going to take some questions. And because Josh Earnest has some pull around here, he just happened to put at the top of the list Colleen Nelson of the Wall Street Journal.
My understanding is, Colleen [Colleen McCain Nelson, Wall Street Journal], that this is wrapping up your stint here and you're going to Kansas City.
Q. Yes.
The President. Josh just happens to be from Kansas City. [Laughter] So I didn't know if there was any coincidence there. But we wish you the very best of luck in your new endeavors.
Q. As it turns out, there's no place like Kansas.
The President. There you go.
U.S. Foreign Policy/President-Elect Donald J. Trump/North Atlantic Treaty Organization/2016 Presidential Election/Democratic Party 
Q. You're about to embark on your final foreign trip. What will you say to other world leaders about your successor? They've expressed many of the same misgivings that you have about Donald Trump. Should they be worried about the future of U.S. foreign policy? And separately, as Democrats scramble to regroup after a pretty shocking upset, what is your advice about where the party goes now? And who should lead your party?
The President. Good. One of the great things about the United States is that when it comes to world affairs, the President obviously is the leader of the executive branch, the Commander in Chief, the spokesperson for the Nation, but the influence and the work that we have is the result not just of the President. It is the result of countless interactions and arrangements and relationships between our military and other militaries and our diplomats and other diplomats and intelligence officers and development workers. And there is enormous continuity beneath the day-to-day news that makes us that indispensable nation when it comes to maintaining order and promoting prosperity around the world. That will continue. In my conversation with the President-elect, he expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships. And so one of the messages I will be able to deliver is his commitment to NATO and the transatlantic alliance. I think that's one of the most important functions I can serve at this stage, during this trip, is to let them know that there is no weakening of resolve when it comes to America's commitment to maintaining a strong and robust NATO relationship and a recognition that those alliances aren't just good for Europe, they're good for the United States, and they're vital for the world.
With respect to the Democratic Party, look, as I said in the Rose Garden right after the election, when your team loses, everybody gets deflated, and it's hard, and it's challenging. And so I think it's a healthy thing for the Democratic Party to go through some reflection. I think it's important for me not to be big-footing that conversation. I think we want to see new voices and new ideas emerge. That's part of the reason why I think term limits are a really useful thing.
I think the Democrats should not waver on our core beliefs and principles: the belief that we should have an economy that works for everybody, not just a few; the belief that America, at its best, is inclusive and not exclusive, that we insist on the dignity and God-given potential and worth of every child, regardless of race or gender or sexual orientation or what ZIP Code they were born in. That we are committed to a world in which we keep America safe, but we recognize that our power doesn't just flow from our extraordinary military, it also flows from the strength of our ideals and our principles and our values.
So there are going to be a core set of values that shouldn't be up for debate, should be our north star. But how we organize politically I think is something that we should spend some time thinking about. I believe that we have better ideas. But I also believe that good ideas don't matter if people don't hear them. And one of the issues that Democrats have to be clear on is that, given population distribution across the country, we have to compete everywhere. We have to show up everywhere. We have to work at a grassroots level, something that's been a running thread in my career.
I won Iowa not because the demographics dictated that I would win Iowa, it was because I spent 87 days going to every small town and fair and fish fry and VFW hall. And there were some counties where I might have lost, but maybe I lost by 20 points instead of 50 points. There are some counties maybe I won that people didn't expect because people had a chance to see you and listen to you and get a sense of who you stood for and who you were fighting for.
And the challenge for a national party is, how do you dig in there and create those kinds of structures so that people have a sense of what it is that you stand for? And that increasingly is difficult to do just through a national press strategy. It's increasingly difficult to do because of the splintering of the press.
And so I think the discussions that have been taking place about how do you build more grassroots organizing, how do you build up State parties and local parties and schoolboard elections you're paying attention to and State rep races and city council races—that all, I think, will contribute to stronger outcomes in the future.
And I'm optimistic that will happen. And I—for Democrats who are feeling completely discouraged, I've been trying to remind them everybody remembers my Boston speech in 2004; they may not remember me showing up here in 2005 when John Kerry had lost a close election, Tom Daschle, the leader of the Senate, had been beaten in an upset. Ken Salazar and I were the only two Democrats that won nationally. Republicans controlled the Senate and the House. And 2 years later, Democrats were winning back Congress, and 4 years later, I was President of the United States.
Things change pretty rapidly. But it doesn't—they don't change inevitably. They change because you work for it. Nobody said democracy is supposed to be easy. This is hard. And in a big country like this, it probably should be hard.
Mark Knoller [ABC News].
Q. Thank you, sir.
The President. Good to see you.
U.S. Presidency/President-Elect Donald J. Trump/2016 Presidential Election 
Q. Thank you. Good to see you. Mr. President, what can you tell us about the learning curve on becoming President? Is—can you tell us how long it took you before you were fully at ease in the job, if that ever happens? And did you discuss this matter with President-elect Trump?
The President. About a week ago, I started feeling pretty good. [Laughter] No, look, I think the learning curve always continues. This is a remarkable job. It is like no other job on Earth. And it is a constant flow of information and challenges and issues. That is truer now than it has ever been, partly because of the nature of information and the interconnection between regions of the world.
If you were President 50 years ago, the tragedy in Syria might not even penetrate what the American people were thinking about on a day-to-day basis. Today, they're seeing vivid images of a child in the aftermath of a bombing. There was a time when if you had a financial crisis in Southeast Asia somewhere, it had no impact on our markets; today, it does.
So the amount of information, the amount of incoming that any administration has to deal with today, and respond to much more rapidly than ever before, that makes it different. I was watching a documentary, that during the Bay of Pigs crisis, JFK had about 2 weeks before anybody reported on it. Imagine that. I think it's fair to say that if something like that happens under a current President, they've got to figure out in about an hour what their response is.
So these are the kinds of points that I shared with the President-elect. It was a free-flowing and, I think, useful conversation. I hope it was. I tried to be as honest as I could about the things I think any President coming in needs to think about. And probably the most important point that I made was that how you staff—particularly your Chief of Staff, your National Security Adviser, your White House Counsel—how you set up a process and a system to surface information, generate options for a President, understanding that, ultimately, the President is going to be the final decisionmaker, that that's something that has to be attended to right away.
I have been blessed by having—and I admittedly am biased—some of the smartest, hardest working, good people in my administration that I think any President has ever had. And as a consequence of that team, I've been able to make good decisions. And if you don't have that around you, then you'll get swamped. So I hope that he appreciated that advice.
What I also discussed was the fact that I had been encouraged by his statements on election night about the need for unity and his interest in being the President for all people, and that how he staffs, the first steps he takes, the first impressions he makes, the reset that can happen after an election—all those things are important and should be thought about. And I think it's important to give him the room and the space to do that. It takes time to put that together.
But I emphasized to him that, look, in an election like this that was so hotly contested and so divided, gestures matter. And how he reaches out to groups that may not have supported him, how he signals his interest in their issues or concerns, I think those are the kinds of things that can set a tone that will help move things forward once he's actually taken office.
Q. And how long did it take before you were at ease in the job?
The President. Well, I didn't really have time to worry about being at ease, because you'll recall, we were losing about 800,000 jobs a month.
So the good news is that in some ways, my experience is atypical. It's hard to find an analogous situation. By the time FDR came into office, the Depression had been going on for a couple of years. We were in the midst of a free fall. The financial system was locking up. The auto industry was about to go belly up. The housing market had entirely collapsed. So one of the advantages that I had was that I was too busy to worry about how acclimated I was feeling in the job. We just had to make a bunch of decisions.
In this situation, we're turning over a country that has challenges, has problems, and obviously, there are people out there who are feeling deeply disaffected. Otherwise, we wouldn't have had the results that we had in the election. On the other hand, if you look at the basic indicators of where the country is right now, the unemployment rate is as low as it's been in 8, 9 years. Incomes and wages have both gone up over the last year faster than they have in a decade or two. We've got historically low uninsured rates. The financial systems are stable. The stock market is hovering around its alltime high, and 401(k)s have been restored. The housing market has recovered.
We have challenges internationally, but our most immediate challenge with respect to ISIL, we're seeing significant progress in Iraq, and Mosul is now increasingly being retaken by Iraqi security forces supported by us. Our alliances are in strong shape. Our—the progress we've made with respect to carbon emissions has been greater than any country on Earth. And gas is 2 bucks a gallon.
So he will have time and space, I think, to make judicious decisions. The incoming administration doesn't have to put out a huge number of fires. They may want to take the country in a significantly different direction, but they've got time to consider what exactly they want to achieve. And that's a testament to the tremendous work that my team has done over the last 8 years. I'm very proud of them for it.
Athena Jones [CNN].
President-Elect Donald J. Trump/2016 Presidential Election 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You said more than once that you did not believe that Donald Trump would ever be elected President, and that you thought he was unfit for the office. Now that you've spent time with him, sitting down and talking to him for an hour and a half in the Oval Office, do you now think that President-elect Trump is qualified to be President?
And if I can do a compound question, the other one is, you mentioned staffing and tone. What do you say to those Americans who may not doubt that there will be a peaceful transition, but that are concerned about some of the policies and sentiments, either expressed by President-elect Trump himself or his supporters that may seem hostile to minorities and others? Specifically, I'm talking about the announcement that Steve Bannon, who is a proponent of the so-called alt-right movement, what many call the White nationalist movement, is going to have a prominent role in the White House under a President Trump as his chief strategist and senior adviser. What message does that send to the country, to the world?
The President. Okay. Athena, without copping out, I think it's fair to say that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on every appointment that the President-elect starts making if I want to be consistent with the notion that we're going to try to facilitate a smooth transition.
Look, the people have spoken. Donald Trump will be the next President, the 45th President of the United States. And it will be up to him to set up a team that he thinks will serve him well and reflect his policies. And those who didn't vote for him have to recognize that that's how democracy works. That's how this system operates.
When I won, there were a number of people who didn't like me and didn't like what I stood for. And I think that whenever you've got an incoming President of the other side, particularly in a bitter election like this, it takes a while for people to reconcile themselves with that new reality. Hopefully, it's a reminder that elections matter and voting counts. And so I don't know how many times we have to relearn this lesson, because we ended up having 43 percent of the country not voting who were eligible to vote. But it makes a difference.
So given that President-elect Trump is now trying to balance what he said in the campaign and the commitments he made to his supporters with working with those who disagreed with him and Members of Congress and reaching out to constituencies that didn't vote for him, I think it's important for us to let him make his decisions. And I think the American people will judge over the course of the next couple of years whether they like what they see and whether these are the kinds of policies and this is the direction that they want to see the country go in.
And my role is to make sure that when I hand off this White House that it is in the best possible shape and that I've been as helpful as I can to him in going forward and building on the progress that we've made.
And my advice, as I said, to the President-elect when we had our discussions was that campaigning is different from governing. I think he recognizes that. I think he's sincere in wanting to be a successful President and moving this country forward. And I don't think any President ever comes in saying to himself, I want to figure out how to make people angry or alienate half the country. I think he's going to try as best he can to make sure that he delivers, not only for the people who voted for him, but for the people at large. And the good thing is, is that there are going to be elections coming up, so there's a built-in incentive for him to try to do that.
But it's only been 6 days. And I think it will be important for him to have the room to staff up, to figure out what his priorities are, to be able to distinguish between what he was campaigning on and what is practical, what he can actually achieve. There are certain things that make for good sound bites, but don't always translate into good policy. And that's something that he and his team, I think, will wrestle with, in the same way that every President wrestles with.
I did say to him, as I've said publicly, that because of the nature of the campaigns and the bitterness and ferocity of the campaigns, that it's really important to try to send some signals of unity and to reach out to minority groups or women or others that were concerned about the tenor of the campaign. And I think that's something that he will want to do. But this is all happening real fast. He's got commitments to supporters that helped to get him here, and he's going to have to balance those. And over the coming weeks and months and years, my hope is, is that those impulses ultimately win out. But it's a little too early to start making judgments on that.
Q. And your views about qualifications, has that changed after meeting with him?
The President. I think that he successfully mobilized a big chunk of the country to vote for him, and he's going to win—he has won. He's going to be the next President. And regardless of what experience or assumptions he brought to the office, this office has a way of waking you up. And those aspects of his positions or predispositions that don't match up with reality he will find shaken up pretty quick, because reality has a way of asserting itself.
And some of his gifts that obviously allowed him to execute one of the biggest political upsets in history, those are ones that, hopefully, he will put to good use on behalf of all the American people.
Scott Horsley [NPR].
U.S. Economy/Trade/2016 Presidential Election 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You're off to Europe, which is facing some of the same populist pressures we see at work in this country. When you spoke at the U.N., you talked about the choice we're facing between integration and building walls.
The President. Right.
Q. What choice do you think the American people made last week? And is there still a chance for what you called a course correction before Europeans make some of their choices?
The President. I think the American people recognize that the world has shrunk, that it's interconnected, that you're not going to put that genie back in the bottle. The American people recognize that their careers or their kids' careers are going to have to be more dynamic, that they might not be working at a single plant for 30 years, but they might have to change careers. They might have to get more education. They might have to retool or retrain.
And I think the American people are game for that. They want to make sure that the rules of the game are fair. And what that means is that if you look at surveys around Americans' attitudes on trade, the majority of the American people still support trade. But they're concerned about whether or not trade is fair and whether we've got the same access to other countries' markets as they have with us. Is there just a race to the bottom when it comes to wages and so forth?
Now, I made an argument—thus far, unsuccessfully—that the trade deal we had organized, TPP, did exactly that: that it strengthened workers' rights and environmental rights, leveled the playing field, and as a consequence, would be good for American workers and American businesses. But that's a complex argument to make when people remember plants closing and jobs being offshored.
So part of what I think this election reflected was people wanting that course correction that you described. And the message around stopping surges of immigration, not creating new trade deals that may be unfair, I think those were themes that played a prominent role in the campaign. As we now shift to governing, my argument is that we do need to make sure that we have an orderly, lawful immigration process, but that if it is orderly and lawful, immigration is good for our economy. It keeps this country young. It keeps it dynamic. We have entrepreneurs and strivers who come here and are willing to take risks. And that's part of the reason why America, historically, has been successful. It's part of the reason why our economy is stronger and better positioned than most of our other competitors, is because we've got a younger population that's more dynamic.
When it comes to trade, I think when you're governing, it will become increasingly apparent that if you were to just eliminate trade deals with Mexico, for example, well, you've got a global supply chain. The parts that are allowing auto plants that were about to shut down to now employ double shifts is because they're bringing in some of those parts to assemble out of Mexico. And so it's not as simple as it might have seemed.
And the key for us—when I say ""us,"" I mean Americans, but I think particularly for progressives—is to say your concerns are real, your anxieties are real, here's how we fix them: higher minimum wage; stronger worker protections so workers have more leverage to get a bigger piece of the pie; stronger financial regulations, not weaker ones; yes to trade, but trade that ensures that these other countries that trade with us aren't engaging in child labor, for example; being attentive to inequality and not tone deaf to it, but offering prescriptions that are actually going to help folks in communities that feel forgotten.
That's going to be our most important strategy. And I think we can successfully do that. People will still be looking to the United States. Our example will still carry great weight. And it continues to be my strong belief that the way we are going to make sure that everybody feels a part of this global economy is not by shutting ourselves off from each other even if we could, but rather by working together more effectively than we have in the past.
Martha Raddatz [ABC News].
President-Elect Donald J. Trump/Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
Q. Thanks, Mr. President. Given some of the harsh words you had about Mr. Trump, calling him ""temperamentally unfit to be Commander in Chief,"" did anything surprise you about President-elect Trump when you met with him in your office? And also I want to know, does anything concern you about a Trump Presidency?
The President. Well, we had a very cordial conversation. And that didn't surprise me to some degree, because I think that he is obviously a gregarious person. He's somebody who, I think, likes to mix it up and to have a vigorous debate.
And what's clear is that he was able to tap into, yes, the anxieties, but also the enthusiasm of his voters in a way that was impressive. And I said so to him, because I think that to the extent that there were a lot of folks who missed the Trump phenomenon, I think that connection that he was able to make with his supporters that was impervious to events that might have sunk another candidate, that's powerful stuff.
I also think that he is coming to this office with fewer set, hard-and-fast policy prescriptions than a lot of other Presidents might be arriving with. I don't think he is ideological. I think ultimately, he's pragmatic in that way. And that can serve him well, as long as he's got good people around him and he has a clear sense of direction.
Do I have concerns? Absolutely. Of course, I've got concerns. He and I differ on a whole bunch of issues. But the Federal Government and our democracy is not a speedboat, it's an ocean liner, as I discovered when I came into office. It took a lot of really hard work for us to make significant policy changes, even in our first 2 years, when we had larger majorities than Mr. Trump will enjoy when he comes into office.
And one of the things I advised him to do was to make sure that before he commits to certain courses of action, he's really dug in and thought through how various issues play themselves out. I'll use a obvious example where we have a difference, but it will be interesting to see what happens in the coming year, and that's the Affordable Care Act.
So, obviously, this has been the holy grail for Republicans over the last 6, 7 years—was, ""We've got to kill Obamacare."" Now, that has been taken as an article of faith, that this is terrible, it doesn't work, and we have to undo it.
But now that Republicans are in charge, they've got to take a look and say, let's see, we've got 20 million people who have health insurance who didn't have it before; health care costs generally have gone up at a significantly slower rate since Obamacare was passed than they did before, which has saved the Federal Treasury hundreds of billions of dollars; people who have health insurance are benefiting in all sorts of ways that they may not be aware of, everything from no longer having lifetime limits on the claims that they can make, to seniors getting prescription drug discounts under Medicare, to free mammograms.
Now, it's one thing to characterize these—this thing as not working when it's just an abstraction. Now, suddenly, you're in charge, and you're going to repeal it. Okay, well, what happens to those 20 million people who have health insurance? Are you going to just kick them off, and suddenly, they don't have health insurance? And in what ways are their lives better because of that? Are you going to repeal the provision that ensures that if you do have health insurance on your job and you lose your job or you change jobs or you start a small business, that you're not discriminated against because you've got a preexisting condition? That's really popular. How are you going to replace it? Are you going to change the policy that kids can stay on their parent's health insurance pla","n until they're 26? How are you going to approach all these issues?
Now, my view is that if they can come up with something better that actually works, and a year or two after they've replaced the Affordable Care Act with their own plan, that 25 million people have health insurance, and it's cheaper and better and running smoothly, I'll be the first ones to say, that's great, congratulations.
If, on the other hand, whatever they're proposing results in millions of people losing coverage and results in people who already have health insurance losing protections that were contained in the legislation, then we're going to have a problem. And I think that's not going to be unique to me; I think the American people will respond that way.
So I think on a lot of issues, what you're going to see is, now comes the hard part. Now is governance. We are going to be able to present to the incoming administration a country that is stronger; a Federal Government that is working better and more efficiently; a national security apparatus that is both more effective and truer to our values; energy policies that are resulting in not just less pollution, but also more jobs.
And I think the President-elect, rightly, would expect that he's judged on whether we improve from that baseline and on those metrics, or things get worse. And if things get worse, then the American people will figure that out pretty quick. And if things get better, then more power to him. And I'll be the first to congratulate him. U.S. Presidency/President-Elect Donald J. Trump 
Q. But you, sir—Mr. President, you had talked specifically about his temperament. Do you still have any concern about his temperament?
The President. As I said—because, Athena asked the question—whatever you bring to this office, this office has a habit of magnifying and pointing out, and hopefully, then you correct for it.
This may seem like a silly example, but I know myself well enough to know I can't keep track of paper. I am not well organized in that way. And so pretty quickly, after I'm getting stacks of briefing books coming in every night, I say to myself, I've got to figure out a system, because I have bad filing, sorting, and organizing habits. And I've got to find some people who can help me keep track of this stuff. Now, that seems trivial, but actually, it ends up being a pretty big piece of business.
I think what will happen with the President-elect is, there are going to be certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well unless he recognizes them and corrects them. Because when you're a candidate and you say something that is inaccurate or controversial, it has less impact than it does when you're President of the United States. Everybody around the world is paying attention. Markets move. National security issues require a level of precision in order to make sure that you don't make mistakes. And I think he's—he recognizes that this is different, and so do the American people.
All right, I'm going to take just a couple more questions, and then I get out of here.
Nadia Bilbassy [Nadia Bilbassy-Charters, Al Arabiya].
Iran/Paris Agreement on Climate Change/Environment 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. President-elect Trump threatened to unravel the Iran nuclear deal, which your administration worked very hard to achieve. What was your concern if he alters part of it? And what would your advice be, considering that he said he's open to your advice?
And on Syria, sir, the Syrian regime now is threatening Aleppo with a massive onslaught. You talked passionately a few years back about Benghazi, and you warned against the killing of civilians there. Many people criticized your administration for the shortcoming on the Syria policy. Are you willing to let Aleppo fall under your watch? And how do you react to President Trump—I mean, President-elect Trump's statement that he won't support the Syrian opposition anymore? Thank you.
The President. Iran is a good example of the gap, I think, between some of the rhetoric in this town—not unique to the President-elect—and the reality. I think there was a really robust debate about the merits of the Iran deal before it was completed. And I actually was pretty proud of how our democracy processed that. It was a serious debate. I think people of good will were on both sides of the issue. Ultimately, we were able to persuade Members of Congress and the public—at least enough of them—to support it.
At the time, the main argument against it was, Iran wouldn't abide by the deal, that they would cheat. We now have over a year of evidence that they have abided by the agreement. That's not just my opinion; it's not just people in my administration. That's the opinion of Israeli military and intelligence officers who are part of a Government that vehemently opposed the deal. So my suspicion is, is that when the President-elect comes in, and he's consulting with his Republican colleagues on the Hill, that they will look at the facts. Because to unravel a deal that's working and preventing Iran from pursuing a nuclear weapon would be hard to explain, particularly if the alternative were to have them freed from any obligations and go ahead and pursue a weapon.
And keep in mind, this is not just an international agreement between us and the Iranians; this is between the P-5-plus-1, other countries, some of our closest allies. And for us to pull out would then require us to start sanctioning those other countries in Europe or China or Russia that were still abiding by the deal because, from their perspective, Iran had done what it was supposed to do.
So it becomes more difficult, I think, to undo something that's working than undo something that isn't working. And when you're not responsible for it, I think you can call it a terrible deal. When you are responsible for the deal and preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, you're more likely to look at the facts.
That is going to be true in other circumstances. For example, the Paris Agreement. Obviously, there's been a lot of talk about the possibility of undoing this international agreement. Now, you've got 200 countries that have signed up for this thing. And the good news is that what we've been able to show over the last 5, 6, 8 years is that it's possible to grow the economy really fast and possible to bring down carbon emissions as well.
It's not just a bunch of rules that we've set up. You've got utilities that are putting in solar panels and creating jobs. You've got the Big Three automakers who have seen record sales and are overachieving on the fuel efficiency standards that we set. Turns out that people like not having to fill up as often and save money at the pump, even if it's good for the environment.
You've got States like California that have been moving forward on a clean energy agenda separate and apart from any Federal regulations that have been put forward. In fact, 40 percent of the country already lives under—in States that are actively pursuing what's embodied in the Paris Agreement and the Clean Power Plant rule. And even States like Texas that politically tend to oppose me, you've seen huge increases in wind power and solar power. And you've got some of the country's biggest companies, like Google and Walmart, all pursuing energy efficiency because it's good for their bottom line.
So what we've been able to do is to embed a lot of these practices into how our economy works. And it's made our economy more efficient, it's helped the bottom line of folks, and it's cleaned up the environment.
What the Paris Agreement now does is say to China and India and other countries that are potentially polluting, come onboard; let's work together so you guys do the same thing.
And the biggest threat when it comes to climate change and pollution isn't going to come from us, because we only have 300 million people. It's going to come from China, with over a billion people, and India, with over a billion people. And if they are pursuing the same kinds of strategies that we did before we became more aware of the environment, then our kids will be choked off.
And so, again, do I think that this new administration will make some changes? Absolutely. But these international agreements, the tradition has been that you carry them forward across administrations, particularly if, once you actually examine them, it turns out that they're doing good for us and binding other countries into behavior that will help us. All right? Last question. Justin Sink [Bloomberg].
Libya/Syria 
Ms. Bilbassy-Charters. Sir, sir, on Syria.
The President. I'm sorry—oh, I'm sorry. Okay, you're right. You are right about that.
With respect to Syria, in Benghazi, we had an international mandate. We had a U.N. security resolution. We had a broad-based coalition, and we were able to carry out a support mission that achieved the initial goal of preventing Benghazi from being slaughtered fairly quickly. It's no secret—you know this region well—that Syria is a much more messy situation, with proxies coming from every direction.
And so I wish that I could bring this to a halt immediately. We have made every effort to try to bring about a political resolution to this challenge. John Kerry has spent an infinite amount of time trying to negotiate with Russians and Iranians and Gulf States and other parties to try to end the killing there. But if what you're asking is, do we have the capacity to carry out the same kinds of military actions in Syria that we did in Libya, the situation is obviously different. We don't have that option easily available to us.
And so we're going to have to continue to try to pursue, as best we can, a political solution and, in the interim, put as much pressure as we can to the parties to arrive at humanitarian safe spaces and cease-fires that at least alleviate the suffering that's on the ground.
I recognize that that has not worked. And it is something that I continue to think about every day, and we continue to try to find some formula that would allow us to see that suffering end. But I think it's not surprising to you, because you study this deeply, that if you have a Syrian military that is committed to killing its people indiscriminately, as necessary, and it is supported by Russia that now has substantial military assets on the ground and are actively supporting that regime, and Iran actively supporting that regime, and we are supporting what has to be our number-one national security priority, which is going after ISIL both in Mosul and ultimately in Raqqa—that the situation is not the same as it was in Libya.
And obviously, there are some who question the steps we took in Libya. I continue to believe that was the right thing to do, although, as I indicated before, in the aftermath of that campaign, I think the world community did not sufficiently support the need for some sort of security structures there, and it now is a situation that we have to get back into a better place.
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. I've given you—okay. Last question is Justin Sink of Bloomberg.
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Policy/Guantanamo Bay Detention Center/Government Ethics/Department of Veterans Affairs 
Q. Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to ask about two things that might be on your desk over the next couple months as you prepare for a Trump administration. One is at least three-quarters of a million undocumented immigrants provided the Federal Government information about themselves and their families as part of your deferred action program. I'm wondering if there's anything you can do to either reassure them or shield that information from the incoming Trump administration, considering his stance on immigration.
And the second is, the administration and you have long maintained that the legal restraints upon you by Congress governing the movement of detainees from Gitmo are an unconstitutional infringement on your right as Commander in Chief. Considering that the gradual transfers that you've pursued are unlikely to continue under a Trump administration, is this now the time to, sort of, test that theory by moving the detainees and seeing where the chips end up lying?
The President. Those are both excellent questions. On the deferred action program that we have, known as DACA, that relates to DREAMers who are currently benefiting from these provisions, I will urge the President-elect and the incoming administration to think long and hard before they are endangering the status of what for all practical purposes are American kids.
I mean, these are kids who were brought here by their parents. They did nothing wrong. They've gone to school. They have pledged allegiance to the flag. Some of them have joined the military. They've enrolled in school. By definition, if they're part of this program, they are solid, wonderful young people of good character. And it is my strong belief that the majority of the American people would not want to see suddenly those kids have to start hiding again. And that's something that I will encourage the President-elect to look at.
With respect to Guantanamo, it is true that I have not been able to close the darn thing—[laughter]—because of the congressional restrictions that have been placed on us. What is also true is, we have greatly reduced the population. You now have significantly less than a hundred people there. There are some additional transfers that may be taking place over the next 2 months.
There is a group of very dangerous people that we have strong evidence of having been guilty of committing terrorist acts against the United States. But because of the nature of the evidence—in some cases, that evidence being compromised—it's very difficult to put them before a typical Article III court. And that group has always been the biggest challenge for us. My strong belief and preference is that we would be much better off closing Gitmo, moving them to a different facility that was clearly governed by U.S. jurisdiction. We'd do it a lot cheaper and just as safely.
Congress disagrees with me, and I gather that the President-elect does as well. We will continue to explore options for doing that. But keep in mind that it's not just a matter of what I'm willing to do. One of the things you discover about being President is that there are all these rules and norms and laws and you've got to pay attention to them. And the people who work for you are also subject to those rules and norms. And that's a piece of advice that I gave to the incoming President.
I am very proud of the fact that we will—knock on wood—leave this administration without significant scandal. We've made mistakes, there have been screw-ups, but I will put the ethics of this administration and our track record in terms of just abiding by the rules and norms and keeping trust with the American people—I will put this administration against any administration in history.
And the reason is because, frankly, we listened to the lawyers. And we had a strong White House Counsel's Office. We had a strong Ethics Office. We had people in every agency whose job it was to remind people, this is how you're supposed to do things. It doesn't mean everybody always did everything exactly the way it's supposed to, because we've got 2 million people working in the Federal Government, if you're including the military, and so we had to just try to institutionalize this as much as we could. And that takes a lot of work. And one of my suggestions to the incoming President is, is that he take that part of the job seriously as well. Again, you wouldn't know this if you were listening to some news outlets or some members of oversight committees in Congress. [Laughter] But if you actually look at the facts, it works.
And this is just one example of the numerous ways in which the Federal Government is much better today than it was, without people really knowing. You look at VA. People remember the legitimate problems that were publicized in Phoenix. It was scandalous what happened. What people don't remember is, is that we've brought in well over a million people who are getting benefits that weren't getting it before, driven the backlog for disability benefits way down, cut homelessness in half. Just made the agency work better—not work perfect, but work better.
And one of the mottos I always had with my staff was, better is good. Perfect is unattainable. Better is possible.
And so we will try to share the lessons that we've learned over these last 8 years with the incoming President. And my hope is, he makes things better. And if he does, we'll all benefit from it.
All right? Thank you, everybody. You guys, some of you who are traveling, you'll get a chance to ask more questions. All right?
[At this point, several reporters began asking questions.]
Thank you."
"January 27, 2017",The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom,Donald J. Trump,"Donald J. Trump, The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/322253",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-theresa-may-the-united-kingdom,"President Trump. Thank you very much. I am honored to have Prime Minister Theresa May here for our first official visit from a foreign leader. This is our first visit, so—great honor.
The special relationship between our two countries has been one of the great forces in history for justice and for peace. And by the way, my mother was born in Scotland—Stornoway—which is serious Scotland. [Laughter]
Today the United States renews our deep bond with Britain: military, financial, cultural, and political. We have one of the great bonds. We pledge our lasting support to this most special relationship. Together, America and the United Kingdom are a beacon for prosperity and the rule of law. That is why the United States respects the sovereignty of the British people and their right of self-determination. A free and independent Britain is a blessing to the world, and our relationship has never been stronger.
Both America and Britain understand that governments must be responsive to everyday working people, that governments must represent their own citizens.
Madam Prime Minister, we look forward to working closely with you as we strengthen our mutual ties in commerce, business, and foreign affairs. Great days lie ahead for our two peoples and our two countries.
On behalf of our Nation, I thank you for joining us here today. It's a really great honor. Thank you very much.
Prime Minister May. Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. And can I start by saying that I'm so pleased that I've been able to be here today. And thank you for inviting me so soon after your Inauguration. And may—and I'm delighted to be able to congratulate you on what was a stunning election victory.
President Trump. Thank you.
Prime Minister May. And, as you say, the invitation is an indication of the strength and importance of the special relationship that exists between our two countries, a relationship based on the bonds of history, of family, kinship, and common interests. And in a further sign of the importance of that relationship, I have today been able to convey Her Majesty the Queen's hope that President Trump and the First Lady would pay a state visit to the United Kingdom later this year. And I'm delighted that the President has accepted that invitation.
Now, today we're discussing a number of topics, and there's much on which we agree. The President has mentioned foreign policy. We are discussing how we can work even more closely together in order to take on and defeat Daesh and the ideology of Islamist extremism wherever it's found.
Our two nations are already leading efforts to face up to this challenge, and we're making progress with Daesh losing territory and fighters, but we need to redouble our efforts. And today we are discussing how we can do this by deepening intelligence and security cooperation and, critically, by stepping up our efforts to counter Daesh in cyberspace. Because we know we will not eradicate this threat until we defeat the idea—the ideology that lies behind it.
Our talks will be continuing later. I'm sure we'll discuss other topics, Syria and Russia.
On defense and security cooperation, we are united in our recognition of NATO as the bulwark of our collective defense. And today we've reaffirmed our unshakeable commitment to this alliance. Mr. President, I think you said—you confirmed that you're a hundred percent behind NATO. But we're also discussing the importance of NATO continuing to ensure it is as equipped to fight terrorism and cyberwarfare as it is to fight more conventional forms of war.
And I've agreed to continue my efforts to encourage my fellow European leaders to deliver on their commitments to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense so that the burden is more fairly shared. It's only by investing properly in our defense that we can ensure we're properly equipped to face our shared challenges together.
And finally, the President and I have mentioned future economic cooperation and trade. Trade between our two countries is already worth over 150 billion pounds a year. The U.S. is the single biggest source of inward investment to the U.K., and together, we've around $1 trillion invested in each other's economies. And the U.K.-U.S. defense relationship is the broadest, deepest, and most advanced of any two countries sharing military hardware and expertise. And I think the President and I are ambitious to build on this relationship in order to grow our respective economies, provide the high-skilled, high-paid jobs of the future for working people across America and across the U.K.
And so we are discussing how we can establish a trade negotiation agreement, take forward immediate high-level talks, lay the groundwork for a U.K.-U.S. trade agreement, and identify the practical steps we can take now in order to enable companies in both countries to trade and do business with one another more easily.
And I'm convinced that a trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. is in the national interest of both countries and will cement the crucial relationship that exists between us, particularly as the U.K. leaves the European Union and reaches out to the world.
Today's talks, I think, are a significant moment for President Trump and I to build our relationship. And I look forward to continuing to work with you as we deliver on the promises of freedom and prosperity for all the people of our respective countries. Thank you.
President Trump. Thank you very much. That's very nicely stated. Steve Holland [Reuters]. Where's Steve? Steve—yes.
Russia-U.S. Relations 
Q. Thank you. You're going to be speaking tomorrow with the Russian President.
President Trump. Yes
Q. What message would you like to convey to him? How close are you to lifting some of the sanctions imposed on Russia over its Ukraine incursion? What would you expect in return? And Prime Minister May, do you foresee any changes in British attitudes towards sanctions on Russia?
President Trump. Well, I hear a call was set up, Steve, and we'll see what happens. As far as the sanctions, very early to be talking about that, but we look to have a great relationship with all countries, ideally. That won't necessarily happen, unfortunately, it probably won't happen with many countries, but if we can have, as we do with Prime Minister May and the relationship that we've all developed, and even in the short relationship that we've just developed just by being with each other—we're going to have lunch, and we've really had some very interesting talks and very productive talks—but if we can have a great relationship with Russia and with China and with all countries, I'm all for that. That would be a tremendous asset. No guarantees, but if we can, that would be a positive, not a negative. Okay?
Prime Minister May. We have—as far as the U.K. is concerned on sanctions for Russia in relation to their activities in the Ukraine—we have been very clear that we want to see the Minsk agreement fully implemented. We believe the sanctions should continue until we see that Minsk agreement fully implemented, and we've been continuing to argue that inside the European Union. Okay?
Laura.
Torture/President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia/Russia-U.S. Relations 
Q. Thank you very much, Prime Minister. Laura Kuenssberg, BBC News. Prime Minister, you've talked about where you agree, but you have also said you would be frank where you disagree with the President. Can you tell us where in our talks you did disagree? And do you think that the President listened to what you had to say? And Mr. President——
President Trump. Absolutely. [Laughter]
Q. We'll see what she says. [Laughter] Mr. President, you've said before that torture works, you've praised Russia, you've said you want to ban some Muslims for coming—from coming to America, you've suggested there should be punishment for abortion. For many people in Britain, those sound like alarming beliefs. What do you say to our viewers at home who are worried about some of your views and worried about you becoming the leader of the free world?
President Trump. This was your choice of a question? [Laughter]
Prime Minister May. [Inaudible]—start off, yes. [Laughter]
President Trump. There goes that relationship. [Laughter]
Prime Minister May. On the issue that you raised with me, Laura, can I confirm that the President—I've been listening to the President, and the President has been listening to me. That's the point of having a conversation and a dialogue. And we have been discussing a number of topics. We'll carry on after this press conference, meeting and, kind of, discussing a number of other topics. And there will be times when we disagree and issues on which we disagree. The point of the special relationship is that we are able to have that open and frank discussion so that we are able to make that clear when it happens.
But I'm clear also that there are many issues on which the United Kingdom and the United States stand alongside one another, many issues on which we agree. And I think, as I said yesterday in my speech, that we are at a moment now when we can build an even stronger special relationship which will be in the interest not just of the U.K. and the United States, but actually in the interests of the wider world as well.
President Trump. Very good. We have a great general who has just been appointed Secretary of Defense, General James Mattis, and he has stated publicly that he does not necessarily believe in torture or waterboarding, or however you want to define it. Enhanced interrogation, I guess, would be a word that a lot of—words that a lot of people would like to use. I don't necessarily agree, but I would tell you that he will override, because I'm giving him that power. He's an expert. He's highly respected. He's the general's general—got through the Senate very, very quickly, which in this country is not easy, I will tell you. [Laughter] And so I'm going to rely on him. I happen to feel that it does work. I've been open about that for a long period of time, but I am going with our leaders. And we're going to win with or without, but I do disagree.
As far as, again, Putin and Russia, I don't say good, bad, or indifferent. I don't know the gentleman. I hope we have a fantastic relationship. That's possible, and it's also possible that we won't. We will see what happens. I will be representing the American people very, very strongly, very forcefully. And if we have a great relationship with Russia and other countries, and if we go after ISIS together, which has to be stopped—that's an evil that has to be stopped—I will consider that a good thing, not a bad thing.
How the relationship works out, I won't be able to tell you that later. I've had many times where I thought I'd get along with people, and I don't like them at all. [Laughter] And I've had some where I didn't think I was going to have much of a relationship, and it turned out to be a great relationship. So, Theresa, we never know about those things, do we? [Laughter] But I will tell you one thing, I'll be representing the American people very strongly. Thank you.
How about John Roberts, Fox.
The President's Phone Conversation With President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico/Mexico-U.S. Relations 
Q. Mr. President, thank you so much. Madam Prime Minister.
President Trump. Thank you.
Q. It's my understanding, Mr. President, that you had an hour-long phone call this morning with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico. Could we get an update on where the relationship is? Further to that, what do you say to your critics who claim that you have already soured a relationship with a very important U.S. ally? And Madam Prime Minister, if I may ask you as well, are you concerned about the state of relations between the United States and Mexico? Sir.
President Trump. Well, I think the Prime Minister, first of all, has other things that she's much more worried about than Mexico and the United States relationship. But I will say that we had a very good call. I have been very strong on Mexico. I have great respect for Mexico. I love the Mexican people. I work with the Mexican people all the time, great relationships. But as you know, Mexico—with the United States—has outnegotiated us and beat us to a pulp through our past leaders. They've made us look foolish. We have a trade deficit of $60 billion with Mexico. On top of that, the border is soft and weak, drugs are pouring in, and I'm not going to let that happen. And General Kelly is going to do a fantastic job at Homeland Security. As you know, we swore him in yesterday.
We have a really, I think, a very good relationship, the President and I, and we had a talk that lasted for about an hour this morning. And we are going to be working on a fair relationship and a new relationship. But the United States cannot continue to lose vast amounts of business, vast amounts of companies, and millions and millions of people losing their jobs. That won't happen with me. We're no longer going to be the country that doesn't know what it's doing. And so we are going to renegotiate our trade deals, and we are going to renegotiate other aspects of our relationship with Mexico. And in the end, I think it will be good for both countries.
But it was a very, very friendly call. I think you'll hear that from the President, and I think you'll hear that from the people of Mexico that really represent him and represent him very well. And I look forward to—over the coming months we'll be negotiating, and we'll see what happens. But I'm representing the people of the United States, and I'm going to represent them as somebody should represent them, not how they've been represented in the past, where we lose to every single country.
Prime Minister May. As the President himself has said, the relationship of the United States with Mexico is a matter for the United States and Mexico.

The President's Relationship With Prime Minister May/United Kingdom Referendum Vote To Leave the European Union 
Q. Mr. President, you've said you would help us with a Brexit trade deal. You said you'd stand by us with NATO, but how can the British Prime Minister believe you, because you have been known in the past to change your position on things? And also, may I ask a question to both of you? People are fascinated to know how you're going to get on with each other. You're so different: the hard-working daughter of a vicar, the brash TV extrovert. Have you found anything in common personally yet?
President Trump. Actually, I'm not as brash as you might think. [Laughter] And I can tell you that I think we're going to get along very well. You know, I've—interesting because I am a people person. I think you are also, Theresa. And I can often tell how I get along with somebody very early, and I believe we're going to have a fantastic relationship.
Brexit—and I really don't change my position very much. If you go back and you look, my position on trade has been solid for many, many years, since I was a very young person talking about how we were getting ripped off by the rest of the world. Now, I never knew I'd be in this position where we can actually do something about it. But we will be talking to your folks about Brexit. Brexit was an example of what was to come, and I happened to be in Scotland at Turnberry cutting a ribbon when Brexit happened. And we had a vast amount of press there. And I said Brexit—this was the day before, you probably remember—I said Brexit is going to happen. And I was scorned in the press for making that prediction. I was scorned. And I said I believe it's going to happen, because people want to know who's coming into their country, and they want to control their own trade and various other things. And lo and behold, the following day, it happened. And the odds weren't looking good for me when I made that statement, because as you know, everybody thought it was not going to happen.
I think Brexit's going to be a wonderful thing for your country. I think when it irons out, you're going to have your own identity, and you're going to have the people that you want in your country, and you're going to be able to make free trade deals without having somebody watching you and what you're doing. And I had a very bad experience. I have—I had something when I was in my other world. I have something in another country, and getting the approvals from Europe was very, very tough. Getting the approvals from the country was fast, easy, and efficient. Getting the approvals from the group—I call them the consortium—was very, very tough. But I thought Brexit—I think and I think it'll go down that it will end up being a fantastic thing for the United Kingdom. I think in the end it will be a tremendous asset, not a tremendous liability. Okay. Prime Minister. And just on the question you asked me, Tom. I mean, I think as the President himself has said, I think we have already struck up a good relationship. But you asked what we had in common. I think if you look at the approach that we're both taking, I think one of the things that we have in common is that we want to put the interests of ordinary working people right up there, center stage. Those people who, you know, they're working all the hours, they're doing their best for their families, and sometimes, they just feel the odds are stacked against them. And it's that interest in ensuring that what we do, that the economies—our economies and our governments actually work for ordinary working people—work for everyone in our countries. I think we both share that.
President Trump. Thank you very much.
Prime Minister May. Thank you.
President Trump. Thank you very much, everybody."

Trudeau of Canada Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/323491",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-justin-pj-trudeau-canada,"President Trump. Prime Minister Trudeau, on behalf of all Americans, I thank you for being with us today. It is my honor to host such a great friend, neighbor, and ally at the White House, a very special place. This year, Canada celebrates the 150th year of Confederation. For Americans, this is one of the many milestones in our friendship, and we look forward—very much forward, I must say—to many more to come.
Our two nations share much more than a border. We share the same values. We share the love—and a truly great love—of freedom. And we share a collective defense. American and Canadian troops have gone to battle together, fought wars together, and forged the special bonds that come when two nations have shed their blood together, which we have.
In these dangerous times, it is more important than ever that we continue to strengthen our vital alliance. The United States is deeply grateful for Canada's contribution to the counter-ISIS effort. Thank you. And we continue to work in common—and in common cause—against terrorism and work in common cooperation toward reciprocal trade and shared growth.
We understand that both of our countries are stronger when we join forces in matters of international commerce. Having more jobs and trade right here in North America is better for both the United States and is also much better for Canada. We should coordinate closely—and we will coordinate closely—to protect jobs in our hemisphere and keep wealth on our continent, and to keep everyone safe.
Prime Minister, I pledge to work with you in pursuit of our many shared interests. This includes a stronger trading relationship between the United States and Canada. It includes safe, efficient, and responsible cross-border travel and migration. And it includes close partnership on domestic and international security.
America is deeply fortunate to have a neighbor like Canada. We have before us the opportunity to build even more bridges and bridges of cooperation and bridges of commerce. Both of us are committed to bringing greater prosperity and opportunity to our people.
We just had a very productive meeting with women business leaders from the United States and Canada, where we discussed how to secure everything that we know the full power of women can do better than anybody else. We know that. I just want to say, Mr. Prime Minister, that I'm focused—and you're focused—on the important role women play in our economies. We must work to address the barriers faced by women and women entrepreneurs, including access to capital, access to markets, and very importantly, access to networks.
In our discussion today, we will focus on improving the ways our Government and our governments together can benefit citizens of both the United States and Canada and, in so doing, advance the greater peace and stability of the world.
Mr. Prime Minister, I look forward to working closely with you to build upon our very historic friendship. There are incredible possibilities for us to pursue, Canada and the United, States together. Again, thank you for joining us, and I know our discussions will be very, very productive for the future of both countries.
Mr. Prime Minister.
Prime Minister Trudeau. Thank you, Mr. President. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you very much for joining us.
I'd first like to start by extending my sincere thanks to President Trump for inviting me down to Washington. Any day I get to visit our southern neighbors is a good day in my book, particularly when it's so nice and warm compared to what it is back home. We are suffering under a significant winter storm that's hitting our Atlantic Provinces particularly harsh, so I just want to send everyone back at home my thoughts as they shovel out and impress on everyone to stay safe.
[At this point, Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
The President and myself have had a very productive first meeting today. We had the opportunity to get to know one another better, and more importantly, we had the opportunity to talk about the unique relationship between Canada and the United States.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]
[Inaudible]—friends on both sides of the 49th parallel have understood that the bond between our nations is a special one. No other neighbors in the entire world are as fundamentally linked as we are. We've fought in conflict zones together, negotiated environmental treaties together, including 1991's historic Air Quality Agreement. And we've entered into groundbreaking economic partnerships that have created good jobs for both of our peoples.
Canadians and Americans alike share a common history as well as people-to-people ties that make us completely and totally integrated. Our workers are connected by trade, transportation, and cross-border commerce. Our communities rely on each other for security, stability, and economic prosperity. Our families have long lived together and worked together. We know that, more often than not, our victories are shared. And just as we celebrate together, so too do we suffer loss and heartbreak together.
Through it all, the foundational pillar upon which our relationship is built is one of mutual respect. And that's a good thing, because as we know, relationships between neighbors are pretty complex, and we won't always agree on everything. But because of our deep, abiding respect for one another, we're able to successfully navigate those complexities and still remain the closest of allies and friends. Make no mistake: At the end of the day, Canada and the U.S. will always remain each other's most essential partner.
And today's conversations have served to reinforce how important that is for both Canadians and Americans. As we know, 35 U.S. States list Canada as their largest export market, and our economies benefit from the over $2 billion in two-way trade that takes place every single day. Millions of good, middle class jobs on both sides of the border depend on this crucial partnership. Maintaining strong economic ties is vital to our mutual success, and we're going to continue to work closely together over the coming years so that Canadian and American families can get ahead. [Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]

Maintaining strong economic ties is vital to our mutual success, and we're going to continue to work closely together over the coming years so that Canadian and American families can get ahead.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]
I'd like to highlight just a few of the specifics that President Trump and I discussed today. At the end of the day, the President and I share a common goal. We both want to make sure that hard-working folks can go to work at a good job, put food on the table for their families, and save up to take a vacation every once in a while. That's what we're trying to do here.
Today we reiterated that our nations are committed to collaborating on energy infrastructure projects that will create jobs while respecting the environment. And as we know, investing in infrastructure is a great way to create the kind of economic growth that our countries so desperately need.
In that same vein, we know that ensuring equal opportunities for women in the workforce is essential for growing the economy and maintaining American and Canadian competitiveness on the world stage. As such, the President and I have agreed to the creation of the Canada-United States Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders. This initiative is more than just about dollars and cents. This is about ensuring that women have access to the same opportunities as men and prioritizing the support and empowerment of women who are senior business leaders and entrepreneurs. In doing so, we'll grow the Canadian and American economies and help our businesses prosper.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Finally, President Trump and myself have agreed to work together to fight against the traffic of opioids across our border. The rise of illegal use of opioids in our society is nothing less than a tragedy. We will do everything we can to ensure the safety of Canadians and Americans.
Ladies and gentlemen, President Trump: I know that if our countries continue to work together, our people will greatly benefit from this cooperation.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]
History has demonstrated time and again that in order to tackle our most pressing issues, both foreign and domestic, we must work with our closest allies, learn from each other, and stand in solidarity as a united voice.
With a level of economic and social integration that is unmatched on the world stage, Canada and the United States will forever be a model example of how to be good neighbors. Winston Churchill once said, ""That long Canadian frontier from the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans, guarded only by neighborly respect and honorable obligations, is an example to every country and a pattern for the future of the world."" That, my friends, is the very essence of the Canada-U.S. relationship.
I look forward to working with President Trump over the coming years to nurture and build upon this historic partnership. Once again, it's a tremendous pleasure to be here in Washington. Merci beaucoup.
President Trump. Okay, we'll take a couple of questions. Scott Thuman [WJLA, Sinclair Broadcasting Group]. Scott.
Canada-U.S. Relations 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
President Trump. Thank you.
Q. You just spoke about the desire to build bridges, although there are some notable and philosophical differences between yourself and Prime Minister Trudeau. I'm curious, as you move forward on issues from trade to terrorism, how do you see this relationship playing out? And are there any specific areas with which during your conversations today you each decided to perhaps alter or amend your stances already on those sensitive issues like terrorism and immigration?
And, Prime Minister Trudeau, while only in its infancy so far, how do you see this relationship compared to that under the Obama administration?
President Trump. Well, we just began discussions. We are going to have a great relationship with Canada, maybe as good or better, hopefully, than ever before. We have some wonderful ideas on immigration. We have some, I think, very strong, very tough ideas on the tremendous problem that we have with terrorism. And I think when we put them all together, which will be very, very quickly—we have a group of very talented people—we will see some very, very obvious results. We're also doing some cross-border things that will make it a lot easier for trade and a lot better and a lot faster for trade.
We have—through technology, we have some really great ideas, and they'll be implemented fairly quickly.
Prime Minister Trudeau. One of the things we spoke about was the fact that security and immigration need to work very well together. And certainly, Canada has emphasized security as we look towards improving our immigration system and remaining true to the values that we have. And we had a very strong and fruitful discussion on exactly that.
There's plenty that we can draw on each other from in terms of how we move forward with a very similar goal, which is to create free, open societies that keep our citizens safe. And that's certainly something that we're very much in agreement on.
Tonda MacCharles [Toronto Star].
Immigration 
Q. Good afternoon, Mr. President and Mr. Prime Minister. And, Mr. Prime Minister, could you answer in English and French for us, please?
A little bit of a follow-on on my American colleague's question. President Trump, you seem to suggest that Syrian refugees are a Trojan horse for potential terrorism, while the Prime Minister hugs refugees and welcomes them with open arms. So I'd like to know, are you confident the northern border is secure? President Trump. You can never be totally confident. But through the incredible efforts—already, I see it happening—of formerly General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, we have really done a great job. We're actually taking people that are criminals—very, very hardened criminals in some cases, with a tremendous track record of abuse and problems—and we're getting them out. And that's what I said I would do. I'm just doing what I said I would do when we won by a very, very large electoral college vote.
And I knew that was going to happen. I knew this is what people were wanting. And that wasn't the only reason, that wasn't my only thing that we did so well on. But that was something was very important. And I said we will get the criminals out, the drug lords, the gang members. We're getting them out.
General Kelly, who is sitting right here, is doing a fantastic job. And I said at the beginning, we are going to get the bad ones—the really bad ones, we're getting them out. And that's exactly what we're doing.
I think that in the end everyone is going to be extremely happy. And I will tell you right now, a lot of people are very, very happy right now.
Prime Minister Trudeau. Canada has always understood that keeping Canadians safe is one of the fundamental responsibilities of any government. And that's certainly something that we're very much focused on.
At the same time, we continue to pursue our policies of openness towards immigration, refugees, without compromising security. And part of the reason we're—we have been successful in doing that over the past year—welcoming close to 40,000 Syrian refugees—is because we have been coordinating with our allies, the United States and around the world, to demonstrate that security comes very seriously to us. And that's something that we continue to deal with.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
It is clear that if you want to have a healthy and secure society or safe society, you have to make sure that you maintain—that you focus on security. And we have welcomed refugees from Syria. We have been very successful, but we have always taken our responsibility toward security very seriously. And our allies, including the United States, understand this focus very well. And they have done so since the very beginning.
President Trump. Kaitlan Collins [Daily Caller], please.
U.S. National Security/North Korea/Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan/Immigration 
Q. Thank you. President Trump, now that you've been in office and received intelligence briefings for nearly 1 month, what do you see as the most important national security matters facing us?
And, Prime Minister Trudeau, you've made very clear that Canada has an open-door policy for Syrian refugees. Do you believe that President Trump's moratorium on immigration has merit on national security grounds?
President Trump. Okay. Thank you. Many, many problems. When I was campaigning, I said it's not a good situation. Now that I see it—including with our intelligence briefings—we have problems that a lot of people have no idea how bad they are, how serious they are, not only internationally, but when you come right here. Well, I mean, obviously, North Korea is a big, big problem, and we will deal with that very strongly. We have problems all over the Middle East. We have problems just about every corner of the globe, no matter where you look. I had a great meeting this weekend with Prime Minister Abe of Japan and got to know each other very, very well—extended weekend, really. We were with each other for long periods of time and our staffs and representatives.
But on the home front, we have to create borders. We have to let people that can love our country in, and I want to do that. We want to have a big, beautiful, open door, and we want people to come in and come in our country. But we cannot let the wrong people in, and I will not allow that to happen during this administration. And people—citizens of our country—want that, and that's their attitude too, I will tell you.
We are getting such praise for our stance, and it's a stance of common sense—maybe a certain toughness, but it's really more than toughness, it's a stance of common sense—and we are going to pursue it vigorously. And we don't want to have our country have the kinds of problems that you're witnessing taking place not only here, but all over the world. We won't stand for it. We won't put up for—with it. We're just not going to let it happen. We're going to give ourselves every bit of chance so that things go well for the United States. And they will go well. Thank you.
Prime Minister Trudeau. Canada and the United States have been neighbors a long time, and Canadians and Americans have stood together, worked together at home and around the world. We've fought and died together in battlefields in World War I and World War II, in Korea, in Afghanistan. But there have been times where we have differed in our approaches, and that's always been done firmly and respectfully.
The last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves. My role, our responsibility, is to continue to govern in such a way that reflects Canadians' approach and be a positive example in the world.
President Trump. Okay.
Prime Minister Trudeau. Richard Latendresse [Groupe TVA].
Canada-U.S. Trade/Mexico-U.S. Trade/Job Creation 
Q. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. I'll ask my question in French first, and then, for you, I'll get—again in English.
[The reporter spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Mr. Prime Minister, if I heard you correctly, you said that Canadian businesses, Canadian workers are concerned for their businesses and for their work and jobs concerning the renegotiation of NAFTA. So what guarantees did you get from this government that we will keep our jobs and our businesses in the renegotiation of NAFTA?
[The reporter spoke in English as follows.]
Mr. President, again, during the last 3 months, you have denounced NAFTA. You have talked over and over about the Mexican portion of the agreement, very little about the Canadian one. My questions in two short part is, is Canada a fair trader? And when you talk about changes to NAFTA concerning Canada, are we again—are you talking about big changes or small changes? Thank you.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Prime Minister Trudeau. First of all, Richard, thank you for your question. It is a real concern for many Canadians because we know that our economy is very dependent on our bonds, our relationship with the United States. Goods and services do cross the border each way every single day, and this means a lot of millions of jobs for Canadians and good jobs for Canadians. So we are always focusing on these jobs, but there are also good jobs, millions of jobs, in the United States that depend on those relationships between our two countries.
So when we sit down as we did today, and as our teams will be doing in the weeks and months to come, we will be talking about how we can continue to create good jobs for our citizens on both sides of the border. And during this exercise, we continue to understand that we have to allow this free flow of goods and services, and we have to be aware of the integration of our economies, which is extremely positive for both our countries. And this is the focus that we will have in the coming weeks and months to come.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]
Canadians are rightly aware of the fact that much of our economy depends on good working relationships with the United States, a good integration with the American economy. And the fact is, millions of good jobs on both sides of the border depend on the smooth and easy flow of goods and services and people back and forth across our border.
And both President Trump and I got elected on commitments to support the middle class, to work hard for people who need a real shot at success. And we know that by working together, by ensuring the continued effective integration of our two economies, we are going to be creating greater opportunities for middle class Canadians and Americans now and well into the future.
President Trump. I agree with that a hundred percent. We have a very outstanding trade relationship with Canada. We'll be tweaking it. We'll be doing certain things that are going to benefit both of our countries. It's a much less severe situation than what's taken place on the southern border. On the southern border, for many, many years, the transaction was not fair to the United States. It was an extremely unfair transaction. We're going to work with Mexico; we're going to make it a fair deal for both parties. I think that we're going to get along very well with Mexico; they understand, and we understand.
You probably have noticed that Ford is making billions of dollars of new investments in this country. You saw Intel the other day announce that because of what I've been doing and what I'm doing in terms of regulation—lowering taxes, et cetera—they're coming in with billions and billions of dollars of investment and thousands of thousands of jobs. General Motors, likewise, is expanding plants and going to build new plants. Fiat Chrysler was at a meeting where they're doing the same. Jack Ma—we have so many people that want to come into the United States. It's actually very exciting.
I think it's going to be a very exciting period of time for the United States and for the workers of the United States, because they have been truly the forgotten man and forgotten women. It's not going to be forgotten anymore, believe me.
So our relationship with Canada is outstanding, and we're going to work together to make it even better. And as far as the southern border is concerned, we're going to get that worked
out. We're going to make it fair, but we are going to make it so that everybody is happy. It's very important to me.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much."
"February 16, 2017",The President's News Conference,Donald J. Trump,"Donald J. Trump, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/323569",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1138,"The President. Thank you very much. I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for Secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr. Alex Acosta. He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student. Former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito. And he has had a tremendous career. He's a member, and has been a member, of the National Labor Relations Board, and has been through Senate confirmation—three times, confirmed—did very, very well. And so Alex, I've wished him the best. We just spoke. And he's going to be—I think he'll be a tremendous Secretary of Labor.
And also, as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, a former Congressman, has just been approved—weeks late, I have to say that. Weeks, weeks late. Office of Management and Budget. And he will be, I think, a fantastic addition. Paul Singer just left. As you know, Paul was very much involved with the anti-Trump or, as they say, ""Never Trump."" And Paul just left, and he's given us his total support. And it's all about unification. We're unifying the party, and hopefully, we're going to be able to unify the country. It's very important to me. I've been talking about that for a long time, but it's very, very important to me. So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office. He was a very strong opponent, and now he's a very strong ally. And I appreciate that.
I think I'll say a few words, and then we'll take some questions. And I had this time, we were—we've been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible. Just absolutely catastrophic, in terms of what was happening. And we've done some really good work. We're very proud of that.
And then, right after that, you prepare yourselves, we'll do some questions. Unless you have no questions; that's always a possibility.
I'm here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last 4 weeks since my Inauguration. We have made incredible progress. I don't think there's ever been a President elected who, in this short period of time, has done what we've done.
A new Rasmussen poll, in fact—because the people get it; much of the media doesn't get it. They actually get it, but they don't write it. Let's put it that way. But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up. The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is—to me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, oh, that's good. Now it means that's good for jobs. Very different. Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States and big league: Ford, General Motors, so many of them.
I'm making this presentation directly to the American people with the media present—which is an honor to have you this morning—because many of our Nation's reporters and folks will not tell you the truth and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve. And I hope going forward, we can be a little bit different and maybe get along a little bit better, if that's possible. Maybe it's not, and that's okay too. Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, DC, along with New York, Los Angeles, in particular, speaks not for the people, but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system. The press has become so dishonest that if we don't talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people—tremendous disservice. We have to talk about it to find out what's going on, because the press, honestly, is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control.
I ran for President to represent the citizens of our country. I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well. I am talking, and really talking, on this very entrenched power structure, and what we're doing is, we're talking about the power structure, we're talking about its entrenchment. As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through to oftentimes distort—not all the time—and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say; they're honest and fantastic. But much of it is not, they—the distortion. And we'll talk about it; you'll be able to ask me questions about it.
But we're not going to let it happen, because I'm here, again, to take my message straight to the people. As you know, our administration inherited many problems across Government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess—it's a mess—at home and abroad. A mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country. You see what's going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places: low pay, low wages. Mass instability overseas, no matter where you look: the Middle East, a disaster; North Korea. We'll take care of it, folks. We're going to take care of it all. I just want to let you know: I inherited a mess.
Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges. On foreign affairs, we've already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders—much of it you've covered—to move forward toward stability, security, and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, of which there are many.
We've had great conversations with the United Kingdom—and meetings—Israel, Mexico, Japan, China, and Canada. Really, really productive conversations. I would say far more productive than you would understand. We've even developed a new council with Canada to promote women's business leaders and entrepreneurs. Very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka.
I have directed our defense community, headed by our great General, now Secretary Mattis—he's over there now, working very hard—to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world. It used to be a small group; now it's in large sections of the world. They've spread like cancer. ISIS has spread like cancer, another mess I inherited.
And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, who's totally taken advantage of our previous administration. And they're the world's top sponsor of terrorism. And we're not going to stop until that problem is properly solved. And it's not properly solved now. It's one of the worst agreements I've ever seen drawn by anybody.
I've ordered plans to begin for the massive rebuilding of the United States military. I've had great support from the Senate. I've had great support from Congress, generally. We've pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military. And I will tell you, that is my—I would be so happy if we never had to use it. But our country will never have had a military like the military we're about to build and rebuild. We have the greatest people on Earth in our military, but they don't have the right equipment. And their equipment is old. I used it—I talked about it at every stop. Depleted—it's depleted. It won't be depleted for long. And I think one of the reasons I'm standing here instead of other people is that, frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military. We have to have strong law enforcement also. So we do not go abroad in the search of war. We really are searching for peace, but it's peace through strength.
At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the Government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years. In each of these actions, I'm keeping my promises to the American people. These are campaign promises. Some people are so surprised that we're having strong borders. Well, that's what I've been talking about for a year and a half, strong borders. They're so surprised—""Oh, he—having strong borders."" Well, that's what I've been talking about to the press and everybody else.
One promise after another, after years of politicians lying to you to get elected. They lied to the American people in order to get elected. Some of the things I'm doing probably aren't popular, but they're necessary for security and for other reasons. And then, coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests, which is more important to many politicians.
I'm here, following through on what I pledged to do. That's all I'm doing. I put it out before the American people. Got 306 electoral college votes. I wasn't supposed to get 222. They said there's no way to get 222; 230 is impossible. Two hundred and seventy, which you need, that was laughable. We got 306 because people came out and voted like they've never seen before. So that's the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan.
In other words, the media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made, and they're not happy about it for whatever reason. And—but a lot of people are happy about it. In fact, I'll be in Melbourne, Florida, 5 o'clock on Saturday, and I heard—just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there.
I turn on the TV, open the newspapers, and I see stories of chaos—chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can't get my Cabinet approved, and they're outstanding people. Like Senator Dan Coats who's there—one of the most respected men of the Senate—he can't get approved. How do you not approve him? He's been a colleague, highly respected, brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it. We're waiting for approval.
So we have a wonderful group of people that's working very hard, that's being very much misrepresented about, and we can't let that happen. So if the Democrats, who have—all you have to do is look at where they are right now—the only thing they can do is delay, because they've screwed things up royally, believe me.
Let me list to you some of the things that we've done in just a short period of time. I just got here. I got here with no Cabinet. Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people. So we'll go over just some of them, and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks coming.
We've withdrawn from the job-killing disaster known as Trans-Pacific Partnership. We're going to make trade deals, but we're going to have one-on-one deals, bilateral. We're going to have one-on-one deals.
We've directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing and called for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure, and that means plant, equipment, roads, bridges, factories. People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory. They go in for a permit—it's many, many years—and then, at the end of the process—they spend tens of millions of dollars on nonsense—and at the end of the process, they get rejected. Now, they may be rejected with me, but it's going to be a quick rejection, not going to take years. But mostly, it's going to be an acceptance. We want plants built, and we want factories built, and we want the jobs. We don't want the jobs going to other countries.
We've imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential Federal workers. We've imposed a temporary moratorium on new Federal regulations. We've issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. Makes sense. Nobody has ever seen regulations like we have. You go to other countries, and you look at industries they have, and you say, let me see your regulations, and they're a fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have. And I want regulations because I want safety, I want environmental—all environmental situations to be taken properly care of. It's very important to me. But you don't need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing.
We've stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing Federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence. We've directed the creation of a Task Force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation—take a look at Chicago and others—taking place right now in our inner cities. Horrible. We've ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs. We're becoming a drug-infested nation. Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars, and we're not going to let it happen any longer.
We've undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our Nation and our tax dollars safe and are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border. Met with General, now Secretary Kelly yesterday, and we're starting that process. And the wall is going to be a great wall, and it's going to be a wall negotiated by me. The price is going to come down, just like it has on everything else I've negotiated for the Government. And we're going to have a wall that works. We're not going to have a wall like they have now, which is either nonexistent or a joke.
We've ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with Federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we've ordered an end to the policy of catch-and-release on the border. No more release, no matter who you are—release. We've begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers, and others who pose a threat to public safety. We are saving American lives every single day—court system has not made it easy for us—and are even creating a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, of which there are many.
We've taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. Though parts of our necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by a judge's, in my opinion, incorrect and unsafe ruling, our administration is working night and day to keep you safe—including reporters safe—and is vigorously defending this lawful order. I will not back down from defending our country. I got elected on defense of our country. And I keep my campaign promises. And our citizens will be very happy when they see the result. They already are, I can tell you that.
Extreme vetting will be put in place, and it already is in place in many places. In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a Circuit that has been overturned at a record number. I've heard 80 percent—I find that hard to believe; that's just a number I heard—that they're overturned 80 percent of the time. I think that Circuit is—that Circuit is in chaos, and that Circuit is, frankly, in turmoil. But we are appealing that, and we are going further.
We're issuing a new executive XE ""Subject: Immigration and naturalization : Foreign nationals and refugees, U.S. admission policy"" action next week that will comprehensively protect our country, so we'll be going along the one path and, hopefully, winning that. At the same time, we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people, and that will be done sometime next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part.
We've also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines—thousands and thousands of jobs—and put new ""buy American"" measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines. In other words, they build a pipeline in this country, and we use the powers of Government to make that pipeline happen, we want them to use American steel. And they're willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along. Even this order was drawn, and they didn't say that. And I'm reading the order, I'm saying, why aren't we using American steel? And they said, that's a good idea. We put it in.
To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, DC, I've started by imposing a 5-year lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government. We've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster, folks. It's a disaster. You can say, oh, Obamacare—I mean, they fill up our rallies with people that you wonder how they get there, but they're not the Republican people that our Representatives are representing. So we've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back. Going to bring our jobs back to this country, big league. It's already happening, but big league.
I've also worked to install a Cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats. You've seen what they've done over the last long number of years. That will be one of the great Cabinets ever assembled in American history. You look at Rex Tillerson—is out there negotiating right now. General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly. We have great, great people. Mick is with us now. We have great people.
Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens. Now, look, fair trade—not free, fair. If a country is taking advantage of us, we're not going to let that happen anymore. Now, every country takes advantage of us, almost. I may be able to find a couple that don't. But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do.
Jobs have already started to surge. Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs. Fiat-Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2,000 new American jobs. They were with me a week ago. You know. You were here. General Motors, likewise, committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave. And if I didn't get elected, believe me, they would have left. And these jobs and these things that I'm announcing would never have come here.
Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with. And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs. Walmart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives. And there will be many, many more. Many more. These are a few that we're naming. Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades—decades and decades and decades, folks. And we're not going to let that happen anymore. Not going to let it happen.
And one more thing: I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a Justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution. Highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats. You may not see that, but he'll get there one way or the other. But he should get there the old-fashioned way, and he should get those votes.
This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country. Again, I say it: There has never been a Presidency that's done so much in such a short period of time. And we haven't even started the big work yet. That starts early next week. Got some very big things are going to be announced next week.
So we're just getting started. We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5 p.m. I hope to see you there. And with that, I just say, God bless America, and let's take some questions.
Mara [Mara Liasson, NPR]. Mara, go ahead. You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference.
Former National Security Adviser Michael T. Flynn/Leaking of Classified Information/News Media 
Q. Mr. President, did you fire Mike Flynn?
The President. Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation. He respectfully gave it. He is a man who—there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today. And I was not happy with the way that information was given.
He didn't have to do that, because what he did wasn't wrong, what he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally. That's the real problem. And you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a fake news, fabricated deal to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats, and the press plays right into it. In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this—they know nothing about it. They weren't in Russia; they never made a phone call to Russia, they never received a phone call. It's all fake news. It's all fake news.
The nice thing is, I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal, Mara—and I think it's very important—the illegal giving out classified information. And let me just tell you, it was given out, like, so much. I'll give you an example. I called, as you know, Mexico. It was a very confidential, classified call, but I called Mexico. And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well, that's nice. Spoke to the President of Mexico. I had a good call. All of a sudden, it's out for the world to see. It's supposed to be secret. It's supposed to be either confidential or classified, in that case. Same thing with Australia. All of a sudden, people are finding out exactly what took place.
The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn. Everybody saw this, and I'm saying—the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is, how does the press get this information that's classified? How do they do it? You know why? Because it's an illegal process, and the press should be ashamed of themselves. But more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves. Really ashamed. Yes, go ahead. 
Ms. Liasson. Why did you keep your Vice President in the dark for almost 2 weeks?
The President. Because when I looked at the information, I said, I don't think he did anything wrong. If anything, he did something right. He was coming into office, he looked at the information. He said, huh, that's fine; that's what they're supposed to do. They're supposed to be—and he didn't just call Russia. He called and spoke to, both ways—I think there were 30-some-odd countries. He's doing the job.
You know, he was just doing his job. But the thing is, he didn't tell our Vice President properly, and then he said he didn't remember. So either way, it wasn't very satisfactory to me. And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position, and that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision.
But he didn't tell the Vice President of the United States the facts, and then he didn't remember. And that just wasn't acceptable to me.
Russia/2016 Presidential Election/News Media 
Q. President Trump, since you brought up Russia, I'm looking for some clarification here. During your campaign, did anyone from your team communicate with members of the Russian Government or Russian intelligence? And if so, what was the nature of those conversations?
The President. Yes, well, the failing New York Times wrote a big, long, front page story yesterday. And it was very much discredited, as you know. It was—it's a joke. And the people mentioned in the story—I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia. They weren't even a part, really—I mean, they were such a minor part, they—I hadn't spoken to them. I think the one person, I don't think I've ever spoken to him. I don't think I've ever met him. And he actually said he was a very low-level member of, I think, a committee for a short period of time. I don't think I ever met him. Now, it's possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don't think I ever met him. I didn't talk to him ever. And he thought it was a joke.
The other person said he never spoke to Russia, never received a call, look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera. And the other person, people knew that he'd represented various countries, but I don't think he represented Russia—but knew that he represented various countries. That's what he does. I mean, people know that. That's Mr. Manafort, who's, by the way—who's, by the way, a respected man. He's a respected man. But I think he represented the Ukraine, or Ukraine Government, or somebody. But everybody—people knew that. Everybody knew that. So these people—and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia. And he said that very forcefully. I saw his statement. He said it very forcefully. Most of the papers don't print it, because that's not good for their stories.
So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it. And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don't have any deals in Russia. President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election. He then called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the Inauguration, which was terrific. But so did many other leaders, almost all other leaders from almost all other countries. So that's the extent.
Russia is fake news. Russia, this is fake news put out by the media. The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration, because they're there—because we have our new people going in place right now. As you know, Mike Pompeo is now—taken control of the CIA; James Comey at FBI. Dan Coats is waiting to be approved. I mean, he is a Senator, and a highly respected one. And he's still waiting to be approved. But our new people are going in.
And just while you're at it, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Times's story yesterday. And it talked about—you saw it, front page. So Director of National Intelligence just put out—Acting—a statement: ""Any suggestion that the United States intelligence community""—this was just given to us—""is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the President and his national security team is not true.""
So they took this front page story out of the Wall Street Journal—top—and they just wrote the story, that it's not true. And I'll tell you something, I'll be honest, because I sort of enjoy this back and forth, and I guess I have all my life, but I've never seen more dishonest media than, frankly, the political media. I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest. But I will say that I never get phone calls from the media. How do they write a story like that in the Wall Street Journal without asking me? Or how do they write a story in the New York Times, put it on front page? That was like that story they wrote about the women and me: front page, big massive story. And it was nasty.
And then, they called. They said, ""We never said that. We like Mr. Trump."" They called up my office—we like Mr. Trump; we never said that. And it was totally—they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you—totally misrepresented. I said, give us a retraction. They never gave us a retraction. And frankly, I then went on to other things.
Okay, go ahead.
2016 Presidential Election 
Q. Mr. President—excuse me.
The President. You okay?
Q. You said—I am, just wanted to get untangled. Very simply, you said today that you had the biggest electoral margins since Ronald Reagan with 304 or 306 electoral votes. In fact, President Obama got 365 in 2008.
The President. Well, I'm talking about Republican. Yes.
Q. President Obama, 332——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——and George H.W. Bush, 426 when he won as President. So why should Americans trust——
The President. Well, no, I was told—I was given that information. I don't know. I was just given. We had a very, very big margin.
Q. I guess my question is, why should Americans trust you when you accused the information they receive of being fake, when you're providing information that's fake?
The President. Well, I don't know. I was given that information. I was given—I've, actually, I've seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory. Do you agree with that? Q. You're the President.
The President. Okay, thank you. [Laughter] I—that's, good answer. Yes.
Q. Mr. President, thank you so much.
The President. Good, sure.
U.S. Intelligence Community/Former National Security Adviser Michael T. Flynn/Leaking of Classified Information 
Q. Good afternoon to you, sir. Can you tell us, in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn—where there's no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed? Did you ask for transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly the Ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, who he was communicating with? What evidence did you weigh to determine that there was no wrongdoing?
And further than that, sir, you've said on a couple of occasions this morning you were going to aggressively pursue the source of these leaks.
The President. We are.
Q. Can we ask what you're doing to do? And also, we've heard about a review of the intelligence community headed by Stephen Feinberg. What can you tell us about that?
The President. Well, first of all, about that, we now have Dan Coats—hopefully, soon—Mike Pompeo and James Comey, and they're in position. So I hope that we'll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else. The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man. And he has offered his services, and it's someth","ing we may take advantage of. But I don't think we'll need that at all because of the fact that I think that we're going to be able to straighten it out very easily on its own.
As far as the general is concerned, when I first heard about it, I said, huh, that doesn't sound wrong. My counsel came—Don McGahn, White House Counsel—and he told me, and I asked him, and he can speak very well for himself. He said he doesn't think anything is wrong. Really didn't think—it was really what happened after that, but he didn't think anything was done wrong. I didn't either, because I waited a period of time, and I started to think about it. I said, well, I don't see—to me, he was doing the job.
The information was provided by—who I don't know, Sally Yates—and I was a little surprised, because I said, doesn't sound like he did anything wrong there. But he did something wrong with respect to the Vice President, and I thought that was not acceptable. As far as the actual making the call—in fact, I've watched various programs, and I've read various articles where he was just doing his job. That was very normal. At first, everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong. After they thought about it, it turned out, he was just doing his job.
So—and I do—and by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he's a fine man.
Yes, Jon.
Q. On the leaks, sir——
The President. Yes, go ahead, finish off, then I'll get you, Jon.
Q. I'm sorry, what will you do on the leaks? You have said twice today—— The President. Yes, we're looking at them very, very seriously. I've gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies, and we're—I've actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks. Those are criminal leaks. They're put out by people either in agencies. I think you'll see it stopping because now we have our people in. You know, again, we don't have our people in because we can't get them approved by the Senate. We just had Jeff Sessions approved in Justice, as an example. So we are looking into that very seriously. It's a criminal act.
You know what I say, when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked. Because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment. When I was called out on Mexico, I was—honestly, I was really, really surprised. But I said, you know, it doesn't make sense, that won't happen. But that wasn't that important to call; it was fine. I could show it to the world, and he could show it to the world—the President who is a very fine man, by the way. Same thing with Australia. I said, that's terrible that it was leaked, but it wasn't that important. But then, I said, I mean, I said, what happens when I'm dealing with the problem of North Korea? What happens when I'm dealing with the problems in the Middle East? Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information—very important, very—I mean, at the highest level, are you going to be reporting about that too?
So I don't want classified information getting out to the public. And in a way, that was almost a test. So I'm dealing with Mexico. I'm dealing with Argentina. We were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn. All this information gets put into the Washington Post and gets put into the New York Times. And I'm saying, what's going to happen when I'm dealing on the Middle East? What's going to happen when I'm dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea? We've got to stop it. That's why it's a criminal penalty.
Yes, Jon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News].
News Media/The President's Cabinet Nominations 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to get you to clarify just a very important point. Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign? And on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks?
The President. Well, the leaks are real. You're the one that wrote about them and reported them. I mean, the leaks are real. You know what they said; you saw it. And the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake, because so much of the news is fake.
So one thing that I felt it was very important to do—and I hope we can correct it, because there is nobody I have more respect for—well, maybe a little bit, but—than reporters, than good reporters. It's very important to me and especially in this position. It's very important. I don't mind bad stories. I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it's true. And over a course of time, I'll make mistakes, and you'll write badly, and I'm okay with that. But I'm not okay when it is fake. I mean, I watch CNN—it's so much anger and hatred, and just the hatred. I don't watch it anymore because it's very good—he's saying no. It's okay, Jim. It's okay, Jim. You'll have your chance. But I watch others too. You're not the only one, so don't feel badly.
But I think it should be straight. I think it should be—I think it would be, frankly, more interesting. I know how good everybody's ratings are right now, but I think they'd actually be—I think they'd actually be better. People—I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress. I think that's right. I don't know, Peter [Alexander, NBC News], is that one right? Because, you know, I think they have lower—I heard, lower than Congress.
But honestly, the public would appreciate it. I'd appreciate it. Again, I don't mind bad stories when it's true. But we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult. I think we're setting a record, or close to a record in the time of approval of a Cabinet. I mean, the numbers are crazy. When I'm looking—some of them had them approved immediately. I'm going forever, and I still have a lot of people that we're waiting for.
And that's all they're doing, is delaying. And you look at Schumer and the mess that he's got over there, and they have nothing going. The only thing they can do is delay. And you know, I think they'd be better served by approving and making sure that they're happy and everybody is good. And sometimes, I mean—I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way. And that's okay. That's fine.
But I think it would—I think they would be much better served, Jon, if they just went through the process quickly. This is pure delay tactics. And they say it, and everybody understands it.
Yes, go ahead, Jim. 
Mr. Karl. The first part of my question on contacts, do you definitively say that nobody——
The President. Well, I had nothing to do with it. I have nothing to do with Russia. I told you, I have no deals there. I have no anything.
Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give—they're not giving classified information. They're giving stuff—what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates—which, by the way, nobody mentions. Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates.
Can you imagine—seriously—can you imagine if I received the questions? It would be the electric chair—[laughter]—okay? ""He should be put in the electric""—you would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, okay? Maybe not you, Jon.
Yes, we'll do you next, Jim. I'll do you next. Yes, yes?
Former National Security Adviser Michael T. Flynn 
Ms. Liasson. Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to clarify one other thing.
The President. Sure.
Q. Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss the sanctions with the Russian Ambassador?
The President. No, I didn't. No, I didn't.
Q. [Inaudible]—prior to the Inauguration——
The President. No, I didn't. But Mike——
Q. Did you fire him because—[inaudible].
The President. Excuse me. No, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence, very simple. Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries and his counterparts. So it certainly would have been okay with me if he did it. I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn't doing it. I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him because that's his job.
And it came out that way—and in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job. And I agreed with him. And since then, I've watched many other people say that.
No, I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn't do it, okay?
Jim [Jim Acosta, CNN].
WikiLeaks/2016 Presidential Election/News Media 
Q. Mr. President, thank you very much. And just for the record, we don't hate you, I don't hate you.
The President. Okay.
Q. So just wanted to pass that along.
The President. Ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job, okay?
Q. If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far here, sir.
The President. Well, not too many. We do have other people. You do have other people, and your ratings aren't as good as some of the other people that are waiting.
Q. They're pretty good right now, actually Mr. President.
The President. Okay. Go ahead, Jim.
Q. If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that WikiLeaks was revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign during the election cycle. You welcomed that at one point.
The President. I was okay with it.
Q. You said you loved WikiLeaks. At another campaign press conference, you called on the Russians to find the missing 30,000 e-mails. I'm wondering, sir, if you——
The President. Well, she was actually missing 33 and then that got extended with a whole pile after that, but that's okay.
Q. Maybe my numbers are off a little bit too.
The President. No, no, but I did say 30, but it was actually higher than that.
Q. If I may ask you, sir, it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged in the campaign.
The President. Okay, fair question. Ready?
Q. So if I may ask you that——
The President. No, no, but are you—let me do one at a time.
Q. If I may ask a follow-up——
The President. Do you mind?
Q. Yes, sir. The President. All right. So in one case, you're talking about highly classified information. In the other case you're talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss. I will say this: If John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun. He said terrible things about her. But it wasn't classified information.
But in one case, you're talking about classified. Regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong—at my suggestion—and I give Reince great credit for this—at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism. I don't want to be hacked. And we did that, and you have seen that they tried to hack us, and they failed.
The DNC did not do that. And if they did it, they could not have been hacked. But they were hacked, and terrible things came. And the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so—they were—when I heard some of those things, I said—I picked up the papers the next morning, I said, oh, this is going to front page. It wasn't even in the papers.
Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers. I would have been the headline in every newspaper.
I mean, think of it. They gave her the questions to a debate, and she should have reported herself. Why didn't Hillary Clinton announce that, ""I'm sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it's inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job""?
Q. And if I may follow up on that—just something that Jonathan Karl was asking you about—you said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake. I guess I don't understand. It seems that there is a disconnect there. If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake?
The President. No, the reporting is fake.
Q. And if I may ask——
The President. Look, look——
Q. I just want to ask one other—yes, sir.
The President. Jim, you know what it is? Here's the thing. The public isn't—they read newspapers, they see television, they watch. They don't know if it's true or false, because they're not involved. I'm involved. I've been involved with this stuff all my life. But I'm involved. So I know when you're telling the truth or when you're not.
I just see many, many untruthful things. And I'll tell you what else I see. I see tone. You know the word ""tone."" The tone is such hatred. I'm really not a bad person, by the way. No, but the tone is such—I do get good ratings, you have to admit that. The tone is such hatred.
I watched this morning, a couple of the networks, and I have to say ""Fox & Friends"" in the morning, they're very honorable people. They're very—not because they're good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong. But they have the most honest morning show. That's all I can say. It's the most honest. But the tone, Jim. If you look—the hatred. The—I mean, sometimes——
Q. [Inaudible]—don't hate you, sir. The President. ——sometimes, somebody gets. Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o'clock in the evening. You just take a look at that show. That is a constant hit. The panel is almost always exclusive anti-Trump. The good news is, he doesn't have good ratings. But the panel is almost exclusive anti-Trump. And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth, the hatred coming from other people on your network.
Now, I will say this. I watch it. I see it. I'm amazed by it. And I just think you'd be a lot better off—I honestly do. The public gets it, you know. Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN. They want to throw their placards at CNN.
I think you would do much better by being different. But you just take a look. Take a look at some of your shows in the morning, in the evening. If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it's brutal.
Now, they'll take this news conference. I'm actually having a very good time, okay? But they'll take this news conference—don't forget that's the way I won. Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day.
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. No, that's how I won. I won with news conferences and probably speeches. I certainly didn't win by people listening to you people, that's for sure. [Laughter]
But I am having a good time. Tomorrow they will say, ""Donald Trump rants and raves at the press."" I'm not ranting and raving. I'm just telling you, you're dishonest people. But I'm not ranting and raving. I love this. I'm having a good time doing it. But tomorrow the headlines are going to be: ""Donald Trump Rants and Raves."" I'm not ranting and raving.
Q. But I'm—if I may just——
The President. Go ahead. 
Q. One more follow-up because——
The President. Should I let him have a little bit more? What do you think, Peter?
Q. Just because of this——
The President. Peter, should I have let him have a little bit more? Sit down. Sit down.
Q. Just because of the attack——
The President. We'll get it.
Q. Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir——
The President. I'm changing it from fake news though.
Q. Doesn't that undermine——
The President. Very fake news now. [Laughter]
Q. I know, but aren't you——
The President. Okay, go ahead.
Q. Real news, Mr. President. Real news.
The President. And you're not related to our new—— Q. I am not related, sir, no. [Laughter] I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say, Mr. President.
The President. I looked—you know, I looked at that name. I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there? Alex Acosta. [Laughter]
Q. I'm sure you checked that out, sir.
The President. No, I checked it. I said—they said, no, sir. I said, do me a favor, go back and check the family tree. [Laughter]
Q. But aren't you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people's faith in the First Amendment freedom of the press, the press in this country when you call stories you don't like ""fake news""? Why not just say it's a story I don't like?
The President. I do that. No, I do that.
Q. When you call it fake news, you're undermining confidence——
The President. No, no, I do it.
Q. ——in our news media.
The President. Here's the thing.
Q. Isn't that important?
The President. Okay, I understand—and you're right about that, except this. See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad. And sometimes, I'll say, wow, that's going to be a great story, and I'll get killed. I know what's good and bad. I'd be a pretty good reporter, not as good as you. But I know what's good. I know what's bad.
And when they change it and make it really bad, something that should be positive. Sometimes, something that should be very positive, they'll make okay. They'll even make it negative. So I understand it, so—because I'm there. I know what was said. I know who is saying it. I'm there. So it's very important to me.
Look, I want to see an honest press. When I started off today by saying that it's so important to the public to get an honest press. The press—the public doesn't believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that, I don't know. But they don't believe you.
If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right? Of course, he had some questions also. But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster; I would be your biggest fan in the world—including bad stories about me. But if you go—as an example, you're CNN—I mean, it's story after story after story is bad. I won. I won. And the other thing: chaos. There's zero chaos. We are running—this is a fine-tuned machine. And Reince happens to be doing a good job. But half of his job is putting out lies by the press.
I said to him yesterday, they—you know, this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don't talk about the real subject, which is illegal leaks. But I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper. And I'm saying, here's my Chief of Staff, a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC. I mean, we won the election, right? We won the Presidency. We got some Senators. We got some—all over the country, you take a look, he's done a great job. And I said to myself, you know—and I said to somebody that was in the room—I said, you take a look at Reince, he's working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires. I mean, they're fake. They're not true. And isn't that a shame, because he'd rather be working on health care. He'd rather be working on tax reform, Jim. I mean that. I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right. Now, I sort of understand there's a certain bias, maybe by Jeff or somebody, for whatever reason. But—and I understand that. But you've got to be at least a little bit fair. And that's why the public sees it—they see it. They see it's not fair. You take a look at some of your shows, and you see the bias and the hatred. And the public is smart. They understand it.
Okay, yes, go ahead. Go ahead.
Russia-U.S. Relations 
Q. We have no doubt that you believe this story is fake news. But for those who believe that there is something to it, is there anything that you have learned over these last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isn't fake news? And secondly——
The President. I think they don't believe it. I don't think the public believes. That's why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof. I don't think they believe it. Well, I guess one of the reasons I'm here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing, that's a ruse. That's a ruse. And by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that. Now, tomorrow you'll say, ""Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia; this is terrible."" It's not terrible, it's good.
We had Hillary Clinton try and do a reset. We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country. You know what uranium is, right? This thing called nuclear weapons and other things. Like, lots of things are done with uranium, including some bad things. Nobody talks about that. I didn't do anything for Russia. I've done nothing for Russia. Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium. Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember, with the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks? Here, take a look. He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button? Hillary Clinton—that was a reset. Remember? It said ""reset.""
Now, if I do that, oh, I'm a bad guy. If we could get along with Russia, that's a positive thing. We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who is going to be meeting with them shortly. And I told him, I said, I know politically it's probably not good for me. Hey, the greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that's 30 miles offshore right out of the water. Everyone in this country is going to say, oh, it's so great. That's not great. That's not great. I would love to be able to get along with Russia.
Now, you've had a lot of Presidents that haven't taken that tact. Look where we are now. Look where we are now. So if I can—now, I love to negotiate things. I do it really well and all that stuff, but it's possible I won't be able to get along with Putin. Maybe it is. But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people—the false, horrible, fake reporting—makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia. And probably, Putin said, you know—he's sitting behind his desk, and he's saying, you know, I see what's going on in the United States, I follow it closely; it's got to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he's got with this fake story. Okay? And that's a shame. Because if we could get along with Russia—and by the way, China and Japan and everyone—if we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing. Tax Reform/Health Care Reform 
Q. Tax reform—[inaudible]
Q. Mr. President, since you——
The President. Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly. We're doing Obamacare; we're in final stages. We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say. And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first. It's not like—frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the health care sooner. So we'll be submitting health care sometime in early March, mid-March. And after that, we're going to come up—and we're doing very well on tax reform.
Yes.
Russia-U.S. Relations 
Q. Mr. President, you mentioned Russia. Let's talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as President of the United States.
The President. Okay.
Q. You mentioned the vessel, the spy vessel, off the coast of the United States.
The President. Not good.
Q. There was a ballistic missile test that many interpreted as a violation——
The President. Not good, not good.
Q. ——of the agreement between the two countries. And a Russian plane buzzed a U.S. destroyer.
The President. Not good.
Q. I listened to you——
The President. Excuse me——
Q. ——during the campaign——
The President. ——excuse me, when did it happen? It happened when—if you were Putin right now, you would say, hey, we're back to the old games with the United States. There's no way Trump can ever do a deal with us because the public—you have to understand, if I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say—you would say—oh, isn't that wonderful. But I know you well enough. Then, you would say, oh, he was too tough, he shouldn't have done that. Look, all of the things——
Q. I'm just trying to find out your orientation to those——
The President. Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Excuse me just one second. 
Q. I'm just trying to find out what you're doing to do about them, Mr. President.
The President. All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he's not going to be able to make a deal with me because it's politically not popular for me to make a deal. So Hillary Clinton tries to reset, it failed. They all tried. But I'm different than those people. Go ahead.
Q. How are you interpreting those moves? And what do you intend to do about them?
The President. Just the way I said it.
Q. Have you given Rex Tillerson any advice or counsel on how to deal?
The President. I have. I have. And I'm so beautifully represented. I'm so honored that the Senate approved him. He's going to be fantastic.
Yes, I think that I've already——
Q. Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir?
The President. No, I don't think so. I think Putin probably assumes that he can't make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal. I can't believe I'm saying I'm a politician, but I guess that's what I am now. Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we're not going to make a deal.
Now, I don't know that we're going to make a deal. I don't know. We might; we might not. But it would be much easier for me to be so tough—the tougher I am on Russia, the better. But you know what, I want to do the right thing for the American people. And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world.
If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along—and don't forget, we're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. There's no upside. We're a very powerful nuclear country, and so are they. I've been briefed. And I can tell you, one thing about a briefing that we're allowed to say, because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it: Nuclear holocaust would be like no other. They're a very powerful nuclear country, and so are we.
If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.
Q. So when you say they're not good, do you mean that they are——
The President. Who did I say is not good?
Q. No, when I read off the three things that have recently happened, and each one of them you said, they're not good.
The President. No, it's not good, but they happened.
Q. But do they damage the relationship?
The President. They all happened recently.
Q. Do they undermine this country's ability to work with Russia?
The President. They all happened recently, and I understand what they're doing, because they're doing the same thing. Now, again, maybe I'm not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried. And if I don't, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump? Does anybody in this room really believe that? Okay.
But I tell you one thing: She tried to make a deal. She had the reset. She gave all that valuable uranium away. She did other things. You know, they say I'm close to Russia. Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States. She's close to Russia. Q. Can we——
The President. I gave—you know what I gave to Russia? You know what I gave? Nothing.
Q. Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations?
The President. Yes, I'm not going to tell you anything about what response I do. I don't talk about military response. I don't say I'm going into Mosul in 4 months. ""We are going to attack Mosul in 4 months."" Then, 3 months later: ""We are going to attack Mosul in 1 month."" ""Next week, we are going to attack Mosul."" In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult. Do you know why? Because—I don't talk about military, and I don't talk about certain other things. You're going to be surprised to hear that. And by the way, my whole campaign, I'd say that.
Q. Right.
The President. So I don't have to tell you—— 
Q. There will be a response?
The President. I don't want to be one of these guys that say, ""Yes, here's what we're going to do."" I don't have to do that.
Q. There will be a——
The President. I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea
Q. In other words, there will be a response, Mr. President?
The President. Wait a minute. I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea. And I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do with Iran. You know why? Because they shouldn't know. And eventually, you guys are going to get tired of asking that question. So when you ask me, what am I going to do with the ship—the Russian ship, as an example—I'm not going to tell you. But hopefully, I won't have to do anything. But I'm not going to tell you. Okay.
Q. Thanks.
Q. Can I just ask you—thank you very much, Mr. President—the Trump——
The President. Where are you from? 
Q. BBC.
The President. Okay. Here's another beauty. [Laughter]
Q. That's a good line. Impartial, free, and fair.
The President. Yes, sure.
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Just like CNN, right? 
The President's Executive Order on Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States 
Q. On the travel ban—we could banter back and forth. On the travel ban, would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of Government, that fine-tuned—— The President. Yes, I do. I do. And let me tell you about the travel——
Q. Were there any mistakes in that?
The President. Wait, wait, wait. I know who you are. Just wait. Let me tell you about the travel ban. We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban, but we had a bad court. We got a bad decision. We had a court that's been overturned—again, maybe wrong, but I think it's 80 percent of the time. A lot. We had a bad decision. We're going to keep going with that decision. We're going to put in a new Executive order next week sometime. But we had a bad decision. That's the only thing that was wrong with the travel ban.
You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports. You had some people that were put out ","there, brought by very nice buses, and they were put out at various locations. Despite that, the only problem that we had is, we had a bad court. We had a court that gave us, what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision. Very bad for the safety and security of our country. The rollout was perfect.
Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same Executive order, but said one thing—and I said this to my people: Give them a 1-month period of time. But General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, said, if you do that, all these people will come in, in the month—the bad ones. You do agree, there are bad people out there, right? They're not everybody that's like you. You have some bad people out there.
So Kelly said, you can't do that. And he was right. As soon as he said it, I said, wow, never thought of it. I said, how about 1 week? He said, no good. You've got to do it immediately, because if you do it immediately, they don't have time to come in. Now, nobody ever reports that, but that's why we did it quickly.
Now, if I would have done it a month, everything would have been perfect. The problem is, we would have wasted a lot of time and maybe a lot of lives, because a lot of bad people would have come into our country.
Q. But just——
The President. Now, in the meantime, we're vetting very, very strongly. Very, very strongly. But we need help, and we need help by getting that Executive order passed.
Q. Just a brief follow-up, and if it's so urgent, why not introduce——
The President. Yes, go ahead.
Russia/2016 Presidential Election 
Q. Thank you. I just was hoping that we could get a yes-or-no answer on one of these questions involving Russia. Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election?
The President. Well, I told you, General Flynn obviously was dealing. So that's one person. But he was dealing, as he should have been——
Q. During the election?
The President. No, no, nobody that I know of. Nobody——
Q. So you're not aware of any contacts during the course of the election?
The President. Look, look, how many times do I have to answer this question? Q. Can you just say yes or no on it?
The President. Russia is a ruse. Yes, I know you have to get up and ask a question—so important. Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia, haven't made a phone call to Russia in years. Don't speak to people from Russia. Not that I wouldn't, I just have nobody to speak to. I spoke to Putin twice. He called me on the election—I told you this—and he called me on the Inauguration a few days ago. We had a very good talk, especially the second one—lasted for a pretty long period of time. I'm sure you probably get it, because it was classified, so I'm sure everybody in this room perhaps has it. But we had a very, very good talk. I have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge, no person that I deal with does.
Now, Manafort has totally denied it. He denied it. Now, people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia. I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine or people that—whoever. But people knew that. Everybody knew that.
Q. But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election?
The President. I have—you know what, he said no. I can only tell you what he—now, he was replaced long before the election. You know that, right? He was replaced long before the election. When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election. But Paul Manafort, who's a good man also, by the way—Paul Manafort was replaced long before the election took place. He was only there for a short period of time.
How much longer should we stay here, folks? Five more minutes, is that okay? Five? 
Q. Mr. President, on national security——
The President. Wait, let's see, who's—I want to find a friendly reporter. Used to say it was Joe—are you a friendly reporter? Watch how friendly he is. Wait, wait—watch how friendly he is. Go ahead. Go ahead. 
Anti-Semitism 
Q. I've been here through the entire campaign, Mr. President.
The President. Go ahead.
Q. So, first of all, my name is Jake Turx from Ami magazine. And I, despite what some of my colleagues may have been reporting, I haven't seen anybody in my community accuse either yourself or any of the—anyone on your staff of being anti-Semitic. We understand that you have Jewish grandchildren; you are their zayde.
The President. Thank you. 
Q. However, what we are concerned about, and what we haven't really heard being addressed, is an uptick in anti-Semitism and how the Government is planning to take care of it. There has been a report out that 48 bomb threats have been made against Jewish centers all across the country in the last couple of weeks. There are people who are committing anti-Semitic acts or threatening to——
The President. You see, he said he was going to ask a very simple, easy question. And it's not. It's not. Not a simple question, not a fair question. Okay, sit down. I understand the rest of your question. So here's the story, folks. Number one, I am the least anti-Semitic person that you've ever seen in your entire life. Number two, racism—the least racist person. In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican.
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. Quiet, quiet, quiet. See, he lied about—he was going to get up and ask a very straight, simple question. So you know, welcome to the world of the media. But let me just tell you something—that I hate the charge. I find it repulsive. I hate even the question, because people that know me—and you heard the Prime Minister, you heard Netanyahu yesterday—did you hear him, Bibi? He said, I've known Donald Trump for a long time, and then he said, forget it.
So you should take that, instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that.
Yes, go ahead. Go ahead.
Q. Thank you. I'm Lisa from the PBS——
The President. See, it just shows you about the press, but that's the way the press is.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Good.
Q. Lisa Desjardins from the PBS NewsHour.
The President. Good.
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Policy/Immigration 
Q. On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the Executive order you plan for next week, even its broad outlines?
The President. Yes.
Q. Will it be focused on specific countries?
The President. It's a very fair question.
Q. And in addition, on the DACA program for immigration——
The President. Right.
Q. ——what is your plan? Do you plan to continue that program or to end it?
The President. We're going to show great heart. DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you. To me, it's one of the most difficult subjects I have, because you have these incredible kids, in many cases—not in all cases. In some of the cases, they're having DACA, and they're gang members, and they're drug dealers too. But you have some absolutely incredible kids—I would say mostly—they were brought here in such a way—it's a very, very tough subject.
We are going to deal with DACA with heart. I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don't forget, and I have to convince them that what I'm saying is right. And I appreciate your understanding on that.
But the DACA situation is a very, very—it's a very difficult thing for me. Because, you know, I love these kids. I love kids. I have kids and grandkids. And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do. And you know, the law is rough. I'm not talking about new laws. I'm talking the existing law is very rough. It's very, very rough.
As far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to the—what I consider to be a very bad decision, but we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways more. But we're tailoring it now to the decision. We have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it. And the new Executive order is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court. Okay?
Q. Mr. President——
The First Lady 
Q. Mr. President, First Lady Melania Trump announced the reopening of the White House Visitors Office.
The President. Yes.
Q. And she does a lot of great work for the country as well. Can you talk a little bit about what First Lady Melania Trump does for the country? And there is a unique level of interest in your administration, so by opening the White House Visitors Office, what does that mean to you and the rest of the——
The President. Now, that's what I call a nice question. [Laughter] That is very nice. Who are you with?
Q. UNF News, it's an independent—— 
The President. Good. I'm going to start watching, all right. Thank you very much.
Melania is terrific. She was here last night. We had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife, who is, by the way, lovely. And we had a really good discussion about Cuba, because we have very similar views on Cuba. And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election as you know, the Cuban people, Americans. And I think that Melania is going to be outstanding. That's right, she just opened up the Visitors Center, in other words, touring of the White House.
She, like others that she's working with, feel very, very strongly about women's issues, women's difficulties—very, very strongly. And she's a very, very strong advocate. I think she's a great representative for this country. And a funny thing happens, because she gets so unfairly maligned. The things they say—I've known her for a long time. She was a very successful person. She was a very successful model. She did really well. She would go home at night and didn't even want to go out with people. She was a very private person. She was always the highest quality that you'll ever find. And the things they say—and I've known her for a long time—the things they say are so unfair. And actually, she's been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies.
I'd just tell you this: I think she's going to be a fantastic First Lady. She's going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people. And helping her and working her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman. And they're not doing this for money. They're not doing this for pay. They're doing this because they feel it, both of them. And Melania goes back and forth, and after Barron finishes school—because it's hard to take a child out of school with a few months left—she and Barron will be moving over to the White House. Okay, thank you. That's a very nice question. Go ahead.
Q. Mr. President.
The President. Yes. Hi—oh, this is going to be a bad question, but that's okay.
Q. No, it's not going to be a bad question.
The President. Good, because I enjoy watching you on television. Go ahead.
The President's Urban Policy Agenda/Congressional Black Caucus/Representative Elijah E. Cummings 
Q. Well, thank you so much. Mr. President, I need to find out from you—you said something as it relates to inner cities. That was one of your platforms during your campaign.
The President. Fix the inner cities, right?
Q. Fixing the inner cities. What will be that fix and your urban agenda, as well as your HBCU Executive order that's coming out this afternoon? Now, see, it wasn't bad, was it?
The President. That was very professional and very good.
Q. I'm very professional, yes.
The President. Yes, well, we'll be announcing the order in a little while, and I'd rather let the order speak for itself. But it will be something, I think, that will be very good for everybody concerned. But we'll talk to you about that after we do the announcement.
As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign. I think it's probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get. We did much higher than people thought I was going to get, and I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher. And by the way, if I might add, including the women's vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get.
So we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities: having to do with education, having to do with crime. We're going to try and fix as quickly as possible—you know it takes a long time. It's taken a hundred years or more for some of these places to evolve, and they evolved, many of them, very badly.
But we're going to be working very hard on health and health care, very, very hard on education. And also, we're going to working in a stringent way, and a very good way, on crime. You go to some of these inner city places, and it's so sad when you look at the crime. You have people—and I've seen this, and I've sort of witnessed it. In fact, in two cases, I have actually witnessed it. They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day. They're living in hell. We can't let that happen. So we're going to be very, very strong.
It's a great question, and it's a very difficult situation, because it's been many, many years. It's been festering for many, many years. But we have places in this country that we have to fix. We have to help African American people that, for the most part, are stuck there—Hispanic American people. We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities, and they're living in hell.
I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago. There are two Chicagos, as you know. There's one Chicago that's incredible, luxurious and all, and safe. There's another Chicago that's worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk about and that you talk about every night on the newscasts. So we're going to do a lot of work on the inner cities. I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities. 
Q. Well, when you say—when you say the inner cities, are you going to include the CBC, Mr. President, in your conversations with your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well
as——
The President. Am I going include who?
Q. Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus——
The President. Well, I would. I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting?
Q. ——as well as——
The President. Do you want to set up the meeting?
Q. No, no, no.
The President. Are they friends of yours?
Q. I'm just a reporter.
The President. No, go ahead, set up the meeting.
Q. I know some of them, but I'm sure they're watching right now.
The President. Let's go set up a meeting. I would love to meet with the Black Caucus. I think it's great—the Congressional Black Caucus. I think it's great. I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings, and he was all excited, and then he said, oh, I can't—move it—might be bad for me politically, I can't have that meeting. I was all set to have the meeting. You know, we called him and called him, and he was all set. I spoke to him on the phone. Very nice guy.
Q. I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well.
The President. He wanted it. But we called, called, called—they can't make a meeting with him. Every day, I walk in, I said, I would like to meet with him. Because I do want to solve the problem. But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that—some other lightweight—[laughter]—he was probably told—he was probably told, don't meet with Trump, it's bad politics. And that's part of the problem in this country.
Okay, one more. Go ahead.
Q. Yes, I have two questions, both——
The President. No, no. One question. Two, we can't handle. This room can't handle two. Go ahead, give me the better of your two.
U.S. Political Divisions 
Q. I'll follow up on my colleague's question about anti-Semitism. It's not about your personality or your beliefs. We're talking about a rise in anti-Semitism around the country, some of it by supporters in your name. What do you——
The President. And some of it—and can I be honest with you? And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up. Some of it written by our opponents. You do know that. Do you understand that? You don't think anybody would do a thing like that. Some of the signs you'll see are not put up by the people that love or like Donald Trump; they're put up by the other side, and you think it's, like, playing it straight. No. But you have some of those signs, and some of that anger is caused by the other side. They'll do signs, and they'll do drawings that are inappropriate. It won't be my people. It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you. Okay.
Q. Can I ask one more follow-up?
Q. Mr. President, one more question, sir.
The President. Go ahead.
Political Tensions in the U. S. 
Q. You are the President now. What are you going to do about it?
The President. Who is that? Where is that? Oh, stand up. You can——
Q. What are you going to do about the tensions that have been discussed?
The President. Oh, I'm working on it. No, I'm working on it very hard.
Q. Are you going to give a speech?
The President. No, no, look. Hey, just so you understand, we had a totally divided country for 8 years, and long before that, in all fairness to President Obama. Long before President Obama, we have had a very divided—I didn't come along and divide this country. This country was seriously divided before I got here.
We're going to work on it very hard. One of the questions I was asked—I thought it was a very good question—was about the inner cities. I mean, that's part of it. But we're going to work on education. We're going to work on lack—you know, we're going to stop—we're going to try and stop the crime. We have great law enforcement officials. We're going to try and stop crime. We're not going to try and stop, we're going to stop crime.
But it's very important to me. But this isn't Donald Trump that divided a nation. We went 8 years with President Obama, and we went many years before President Obama. We lived in a divided nation. And I am going to try—I will do everything within my power—to fix that.
I want to thank everybody very much. It's a great honor to be with you. Thank you. Thank you very much."

Trump, The President's News Conference With President Juan Manuel Santos Calderon of Colombia Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/327804",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-juan-manuel-santos-calderon-colombia-0,"President Trump. Thank you very much. It is a great pleasure to welcome President Santos to the White House. Colombia is one of our closest allies in the hemisphere, and today we reaffirm partnership between our two great nations.
President Santos and I had a very productive meeting, and we will continue to work very closely together to bring peace, safety, and prosperity to the hemisphere. Perhaps no area is really more important in terms of cooperation than our joint effort to end the terrible drug crimes that plague both of our countries.
Recently, we have seen an alarmed—and I mean really a very highly alarmed and alarming trend. Last year, Colombia coca cultivation and cocaine production reached a record high, which, hopefully, will be remedied very quickly by the President. We must confront this dangerous threat to our societies together.
Today I affirmed the United States willingness to assist Colombia's strategy to target and eliminate drug trafficking networks, illicit financings, coca cultivation, and cocaine production, of which there is far too much. The drug epidemic is poisoning too many American lives, and we're going to stop it many different ways. One of them will be the wall.
My administration is committed to keeping drugs and gangs from pouring into our country. Already, border crossings are down more than 73 percent. Secretary Kelly is with us; he's done a fantastic job. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. And in short, we have a tremendous group of people working with us in terms of ICE, the ICE patrol and the Border Patrol agents. They've done a fantastic job, and I'd like you to give them my highest compliments, Mr. Secretary.
And MS-13, likewise—a horrible, horrible, large group of gangs that have been let into our country over a fairly short period of time—are being decimated by the Border Patrol, by ICE, and by our incredible local police forces. And they are getting out of our country or, in some cases, going directly into prisons throughout our country. But they've literally taken over towns and cities of the United States. They will be gone very quickly.
I look forward to working with President Santos as we target drug trafficking. Both the United States and Colombia have strong law enforcement and security relationship. We've had it and especially over the last fairly short period of time. Together, we will continue to fight the criminal networks responsible for the deadly drug trade that our people have a really strong commitment to getting rid of, because they want a much brighter future.
President Santos and I also discussed the deteriorating situation in Venezuela, and it is really in a very bad state, as you see and as we all see through the media. The stable and peaceful Venezuela is in the best interest of the entire hemisphere, and America stands with all of the people in our great hemisphere yearning to be free. We will be working with Colombia and other countries on the Venezuelan problem. It is a very, very horrible problem. And from a humanitarian standpoint, it is like nothing we've seen in quite a long time. The United States and Colombia are also strong economic partners, and we will continue to pursue trade policies that benefit both of our peoples. The nations' common goals of protecting our citizens, expanding opportunity, and confronting the drug crisis will improve the lives of our people and many throughout the region.
So many people are being so horribly affected by what's going on in terms of violence and in terms of drugs, and we're going to take care of the situation. And we've both agreed to take care of it strongly and quickly.
President Santos, it was an honor to meet with you and your entire group of representatives, very talented people indeed, who have been working with us and my representatives. And I look forward to many more productive meetings, such as the one we just had. I'd like to thank you very much for being at the White House, being our guest. And I'd like to congratulate you on winning the Nobel Peace Prize. That's a very great achievement. Thank you very much.
President Santos. Mr. President, I want to thank you personally for this warm and productive visit and for the strong support Colombia has received from your administration, from Congress, and from the American people.
[At this point, President Santos spoke in Spanish, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
President Santos. As you know, our nations have had for a long time a strategic alliance and extraordinary friendship. We believe in the same principles of democracy, freedom, and the rule of law. And we work so that the Western Hemisphere can be more prosperous and safe.
The United States and Colombia, they're both democracies of greater—of longer standing in the hemisphere, we have supported each other. Our soldiers fought shoulder to shoulder in the Korean war. At the request of the United States, we sent antidrug experts to Afghanistan. And today, Colombia and the United States are working together to support Central America in their fight against drug cartels and the violence of organized crime.
I can say, Mr. President, based on our conversation this afternoon, that I have no doubt that the United States and Colombia continue to be, today, more than ever, a support, one for the other. Our alliance was strengthened. Our most valuable cooperation has been Plan Colombia, which I can sum up in very simple terms.
When Colombians were fighting to survive—for our democracy to survive, actually—faced with the threat of terrorism and drug trafficking, the United States stretched out a hand and helped us win that battle. We will never forget it.
Today, we live in a different country. Today, Colombia is a more peaceful society, a more modern and a fairer society. In November last year, we ended the longest and last armed conflict existing in our hemisphere. The guerilla is putting down weapons at this precise time to the United Nations. Insecurity has gone down significantly. Today, we have the lowest levels of violence of the last 40 years.
At the same time, we have had significant progress for our citizens on issues such as education, housing, health, and social services. Millions of Colombians have been lifted out of poverty. Today, we continue next to you as partners in Peace Colombia to consolidate peace in the most affected areas. With the robust support of your Government, we are removing thousands of antipersonnel mines that murdered and mutilated children, women, and soldiers. We are healing the wounds of our victims, and we are embarking on a big social development program.
Such as we said today, we are working with your administration to take advantage of the unique opportunity peace offers so as to reduce permanently the production of coca leaf in Colombia and fight more effectively the other links in drug trafficking, including consumption. We must continue and deepen the fight against organized crime, transnational crime responsible not just for drug trafficking, but also for human trafficking and illegal mining.
Our shared agenda, framed within a high-level dialogue that we Colombians value so much, includes cooperation which has allowed us to have unprecedented progress towards quality education for everyone. And this is a priority in the policies of my Government, and we wish to do more with regards to innovation and technology.
With the active participation of the private sector, we have reached trade agreements, investment agreements that are mutually beneficial. This morning we established the entrepreneurial council between the United States and Colombia. We are and wish to continue to be the best destination in Latin America for American businesses. Colombia will continue to be very proudly a close friend and a strategic ally of the United States.
Dear President Trump, I hope you can visit us soon so that you can personally witness the transformation underway in our country. I hope to be able to welcome you to a Colombia in peace, a more equitable Colombia, a better educated Colombia that you have so much contributed to.
Thank you so much.
President Trump. Thank you very much. Does anybody have any questions? [Laughter] I'm shocked.
Jon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News], go ahead.
Q. Mr. President, thank you very much.
President Trump. Thank you.
Russia's Efforts To Influence the 2016 Presidential Election/Job Creation and Growth/Islamic State of Iraq and Syria 
Q. I'd like to get your—Mr. President, I'd like to get your reaction to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's decision to appoint a Special Counsel to investigate the Russia—Russian interference in the campaign. Was this the right move, or is this part of a ""witch hunt""?
President Trump. Well, I respect the move, but the entire thing has been a witch hunt. And there is no collusion between certainly myself and my campaign, but I can always speak for myself—and the Russians, zero.
I think it divides the country. I think we have a very divided country because of that and many other things. So I can tell you that we want to bring this great country of ours together, Jon. And I will also say very strongly, we've had tremendous success. You look at our job numbers, you look at what's going on at the border, as we discussed before; if you look at what will be happening—you're going to see some incredible numbers with respect to the success of General Mattis and others with the ISIS situation. The numbers are staggering, how successful they've been, the military has been. Tomorrow, as you know, I'm going to Saudi Arabia, going to Israel. I'm going to Rome. And we have the G-7. We have a lot of great things going on.
So I hate to see anything that divides. I'm fine with whatever people want to do, but we have to get back to running this country really, really well. We've made tremendous progress in the last hundred-some-odd days. Tremendous progress. And you see job numbers; you see all of the production that's starting. Plants starting to open again. Haven't been open in years. I'm very proud of it. That's what I want to be focused on. Because, believe me, there's no collusion. Russia is fine. But whether it's Russia or anybody else, my total priority, believe me, is the United States of America.
So thank you very much.
President Santos. [Inaudible]
Venezuela 
[A reporter spoke in Spanish, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Q. President Trump, President Santos, can we say that today we are setting a new roadmap in the relationship between Colombia and the United States? Which are the concrete commitments? You were talking about the postconflict time. Many funds are needed for that.
And on the issue of Venezuela, President Trump, many deaths, human rights violations. There's plenty to be done.
President Trump. Well, that's true. Venezuela is a very, very serious problem. We haven't really seen a problem like that, I would say, Mr. President, in decades, in terms of the kind of violence that we're witnessing. The President was telling me—and I knew—that Venezuela was a very, very wealthy country, just about the wealthiest in your neck of the woods, and had tremendous strengths in so many different ways. And now it's poverty stricken. People don't have enough to eat. People have no food. There's great violence. And we will do whatever is necessary—and we'll work together to do whatever is necessary—to help with fixing that. And I'm really talking on a humanitarian level.
When you look at the oil reserves that they have, when you look at the potential wealth that Venezuela has, you sort of have to wonder, why is that happening? How is that possible? But it's been unbelievably poorly run for a long period of time. And hopefully, that will change, and they can use those assets for the good and to take care of their people. Because right now what's happening is really a disgrace to humanity.
And, Jon, I think you also had a question for the President, if you'd like to.
Q. Does he have another one?
[President Santos spoke briefly in English as follows.]
President Santos. I answered his question about the commitment.
[President Santos continued in Spanish, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
President Santos. The commitment on President Trump's side and his administration was shown through the approval of the budget that, for Colombia, means an increase in the support to fund the postconflict era. Last night we received from a very important organization, The Atlantic Council, a report, which includes both parties presided by a Republican Senator and a Democrat Senator with a roadmap recommending the governments of the United States and Colombia to follow.
This morning we established this entrepreneurial council, United States-Colombia, so that the private sector can also have a voice in that roadmap. This means we are working together on every front that can be convenient for both countries. But we'll continue to work together. We have ratified that commitment today during our conversation.
And as I said before, we have the best of relations with the United States. We are strategic allies in the region, and we will continue to be so.
Mexico-U.S. Border Security 
Mr. Karl. Thank you, Mr. President. President Santos, to you, you heard President Trump say that critical to stopping the flow of drugs into the United States will be the wall that he wants to build on the Mexican border. Do you agree with him? Would that wall be a step, a positive step and a step towards reducing the flow of drugs across the border?
[President Santos spoke in English as follows.]
President Santos. I believe that the best way to fight the drug trafficking is by collaborating. This is not a problem of Colombia only or a problem of the United States only, it's a world problem. And we have to all work together. We declared the war on drugs 40 years ago. The world declared the war on drugs. And it's a war that has not been won. So we must be more effective and more efficient.
Now, we are doing a very big effort, because of the peace process, to have a new strategy: carrot and stick. Stick, by forced eradication. We have already eradicated, this year only, 15,000 hectares, which is the whole volume that we eradicated last year. And we're starting to eradicate—to substitute voluntarily, through a program where the peasants—and we have 80,000 families already in the program—that they are going to substitute for legal crops. And this is the first time that this could be done because of the peace. Before, the conflict did not allow us to build roads and to give these peasants an alternative. Now we have. So we have to take advantage of this opportunity and continue reducing the production of coca.
In the meantime, we will work together, the U.S. and Colombia, with other countries—Central America—to fight the other links of the chain, the intermediaries. We have destroyed 22,000 laboratories in the Colombian jungles, seizing the cocaine in the transit. We have seized record amount of tons last year, and this year, we're doing even better than last year.
So by working together, we can be much more effective, and that is the commitment we just made or ratified this afternoon.
President Trump. And that was a long and very diplomatic answer to your question. [Laughter] I will say it a little bit shorter: Walls work. Just ask Israel. They work. Believe me, they work. And we have no choice.
Peter Baker [New York Times]. Yes.
Former National Security Adviser Michael T. Flynn 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. In the light of a very busy news week, a lot of people would like to get to the bottom of a couple of things, give you a chance to go on record here. Did you at any time urge former FBI Director James Comey in any way, shape, or form to close or to back down the investigation into Michael Flynn?
And also as you look back——
President Trump. No. No. Next question. [Laughter]
Investigation of Russia's Efforts To Influence the 2016 Presidential Election/Former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James B. Comey, Jr./Health Care Reform/Job Creation and Growth 
Q. Next question. As you look back over the past 6 months or year, have you had any recollection where you've wondered if anything you have done has been something that might be worthy of criminal charges in these investigations or impeachment, as some on the left are implying?
President Trump. I think it's totally ridiculous. Everybody thinks so. And again, we have to get back to working our country properly so that we can take care of the problems that we have. We have plenty of problems. We've done a fantastic job. We have a tremendous group of people. Millions and millions of people out there that are looking at what you had just said and said, ""What are they doing?""
Director Comey was very unpopular with most people. I actually thought when I made that decision—and I also got a very, very strong recommendation, as you know, from the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein. But when I made that decision, I actually thought that it would be a bipartisan decision, because you look at all of the people on the Democratic side—not only the Republican side—that were saying such terrible things about Director Comey.
Then, he had the very poor performance on Wednesday. That was a poor, poor performance, so poor, in fact, that I believe—and you'd have to ask him, because I don't like to speak for other people—but I believe that's why the Deputy Attorney General went out and wrote his very, very strong letter.
And then, on top of that, after the Wednesday performance by Director Comey, you had a person come and have to readjust the record, which many people have never seen before, because there were misstatements made. And I thought that was something that was terrible.
We need a great Director of the FBI. I cherish the FBI. It's special. All over the world, no matter where you go, the FBI is special. The FBI has not had that special reputation with what happened in the campaign, what happened with respect to the Clinton campaign, and even you could say—directly or indirectly—with respect to the much more successful Trump campaign.
We're going to have a Director who is going to be outstanding. I'll be announcing that director very soon, and I look forward to doing it. I think the people in the FBI will be very, very thrilled.
And just in concluding, we look forward to getting this whole situation behind us so that when we go for the jobs, we go for the strong military, when we go for all of the things that we've been pushing so hard and so successfully, including health care—because Obamacare is collapsing. It's dead; it's gone. There's nothing to compare anything to because we don't have health care in this country. You just look at what's happening. Aetna just pulled out. Other insurance companies are pulling out. We don't have health care. Obamacare is a fallacy. It's gone. We need health care. We need to cut taxes. We're going to cut taxes. Forget what I want; it will be the biggest tax cut in the history of our Nation. And that's what I want. It's going to bring back companies. It's going to bring back jobs. We lost so many jobs and so many companies to countries that are not so far from you, Mr. President—they're very close to you, actually—and to many other places throughout the world. We're going to change that. We're going to have expansion.
We already do. You look at what's happening with Ford and with General Motors in Michigan and Ohio. You look at the tremendous number of jobs that are being announced in so many different fields. That's what I'm proud of, and that's what we want to focus our energy on.
The other is something I can only tell you: There was no collusion. And everybody—even my enemies have said, there is no collusion.
So we want to get back and keep on the track that we're on. Because the track that we're on is record setting, and that's what we want to do, is we want to break very positive records.
Thank you. You could ask a question.
President Santos. Ricardo.
[President Santos spoke in English as follows.]
Oh, sorry, you have another question?
Mr. Baker. For you—yes, sir, Mr. President. My question is, as someone who led a nation that's really done a lot of rebuilding and had to rebound from an epidemic of crime and drugs over quite a many years, what do you make of Mr. Trump's America first policy? And further, you've had a tough time with conservative radio, sometimes been called a punching bag. And you've said you have to persevere. I'm curious if you've given any advice to President Trump on how to do so.
[President Santos spoke in English as follows.]
President Santos. I don't think I'm in a position to give any advice to President Trump. He can take care of himself. [Laughter]
And what I—what we did in Colombia, you quite rightly mentioned it, is persevere. We—when you know your port of destination and we know—you know that you're doing the correct thing, you simply have to persevere. And that's what we've done in Colombia, and that's why we were on the verge of being a failed state some years ago. And now we're one of the stars of the region. And that's through hard work, perseverance, and clarity of your objectives. And that's what we have done, and we have to continue, because the trip is not over.
Ricardo Ávila [Portafolio].
Colombian Peace Agreement/Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) Insurgent Group 
[A reporter spoke in Spanish, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Q. Mr. President, I'd like to ask you about trade. You're about to start the renegotiation of NAFTA. And Colombia—and like other countries in the hemisphere—has a large trade deficit with the United States. Are you worried about the fact that that could contribute to increasing that trade deficit? [The reporter continued in English as follows.]
President Trump, what is your position on the peace process in Colombia?
President Trump. Well, it's been a long process, and it's been a great thing to watch in the sense that the President did a fantastic job. That's not easy after so many years of war. So I'm very, very proud to get to know you, and I really congratulate you. There's nothing tougher than peace, and we want to make peace all over the world. And you are really a great example of somebody that started it.
I mean, FARC is—that was a long, tough situation, as you know very well, coming from the country. But I think the President has done a magnificent job. Not easy. But he's done a magnificent job.
[President Santos spoke in Spanish, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
President Santos. Clearer impossible. [Laughter]
On the trade issue, our deficit with the United States is not so large. It is a moderate deficit, which, of course, both countries will try to increase the volume of trade in both directions and investments also in both directions.
Colombia is becoming an important investor here in the United States, and this is something not many people know. But we have considerable investments in the United States.
We have attempted to give dynamism to these flows of trade, of investment, getting together those main players who are the investors in the private sector. I believe the foundations have been laid. We have the free trade agreement, which is working well. The number of Colombian businesses that are exporting to the United States has grown. And we both believe that we can take greater advantage of those agreements in order to increase flows in both directions for the benefit both of the Colombian and American peoples.
President Trump. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, thank you."

Trump, The President's News Conference With President Emmanuel Macron of France in Paris, France Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/329517",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-emmanuel-macron-france-paris-france,"[President Macron spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
President Macron. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. First and foremost, I meant to thank President Trump for his visit to Paris this afternoon and tomorrow—tomorrow morning—as well as thank his delegation. I was very pleased that—to be able to welcome President Trump and his spouse today. He accepted the invitation I extended a couple of weeks ago in order to invite him to join the ceremonies of the 14th of July tomorrow.
I think it is both a symbol and an important—very important that the President of the United States could be with us tomorrow on the occasion of our National Day and attend a military parade which will—to which the American troops will take part. We will be also commemorating the hundredth anniversary of the American troops joining World War I with the Allies in France.
I think it is important because, beyond daily news, we live in countries with roots which are deeper and go further and beyond who we are. So the presence of President Trump was, in my eyes, not only natural, and I think it is also an excellent thing for the history of both our countries.
Earlier today we started by sharing part of our joint history at the Invalides Museum, the Army Museum. Then, we had a working session. And I shall say that I'm extremely pleased about it. We've been able to talk about a number of topics of joint interest, and we underlined a number of shared convictions and, most importantly, a joint roadmap for—in order to work together in the coming months.
We agreed to do our utmost to have—to implement free and fair trade, and in the field—and this is what G-20 in Hamburg also expressed in terms of sensitivity—we want to work together in order to implement some efficient measures to tackle dumping anywhere it is taking place in all the fields, by sharing the information that we have and making sure that both the European Unions and the United States can take the necessary measures in order to protect within the context of free trade, but of fair, free trade that we can protect all over sectors of activities where we are active.
We then had a long discussion which enabled us to cover all of the topics of international policies and the challenges for the security—security challenges for the people as well. When it comes to fighting terrorism, from day one, I can say that we've seen eye to eye, and we are strongly determined to take any necessary measures in order to root out terrorism and to eradicate it no matter where, in particular their narrative. On the internet, we agreed to strengthen our action and our cooperation in fighting against propaganda.
We want to get the—all the major operators to limit the propaganda and also tackle cyber criminality. These topics, I believe, are fundamental. And I do hope that we can strengthen the cooperation between both our countries. And it is a lot—with a lot of satisfaction that I heard from President Trump the very same approach. And our services will then, therefore, be working together in the coming weeks and months to have a solid action map for that. Regarding the situation in Iraq and in Syria, here again, we agreed to continue to work together, in particular, in order to be able to launch together some diplomatic initiatives in order to put in place a roadmap for what will come after the war.
We talked about our role, our postconflict role, but initially, we want to put in place a contact group in order to be more efficient, in order to be able to support what is being done by the U.S.—by the United Nations, in order to support a political roadmap, in particular for Syria after the war. It is important to put in place some inclusive political solutions for that period of time. We know where destabilization comes from. The roadmap will take care of that. We'll cover it. And we'll also ask our diplomats and our staff to work along those lines so that, in the coming weeks, some concrete initiatives can be taken. And they're supported by the P-5.
We also share the same intentions regarding Libya. And like I told President Trump, I very much want to take a number of diplomatic initiatives, strong ones, given the situation that we know, and which requires more stability and better control over the region.
With Libya or the Sahel, I think I can say that we have the same vision, a very coherent understanding of the situation in the region, and the same willingness to act very clearly against any form of terrorism and destabilization.
Next, climate. Well, here we know what our disagreements are. We have expressed them on a number of occasions. But I think it is important that we can continue to talk about it. I very much respect the decision taken by President Trump. He will work upon implementing his campaign promises. And as far as I'm concerned, I remain attached to the Paris accord, and we'll make sure that, step by step, we can do everything which is in the accord.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is in summary what we've been talking about. We will continue under a friendly—with a friendly tone and informal one this evening. Regarding trade and security for both our countries, the fight against terrorism, stability in the Near and Middle East, in Libya or in the Sahel, I can say that we have a shared determination. The United States is extremely involved in the Iraq war, and I would like to thank President Trump for everything that's been done by the American troops against this background. But I would like him to know that I am fully determined to act together with him in this respect, fully determined.
I very much want both our countries in these matters to increase their cooperation in the coming months, because the threat we are facing is a global one. The enemies—our enemies—are trying to destabilize us by any way. And I believe that this is very much at the heart of the historic alliance between our two countries, and which fully justifies the presence of President Trump today and tomorrow in Paris.
Thank you. Thank you, dear Donald. Thank you.
President Trump. Well, thank you very much, President Macron. And Melania and I are thrilled to join you and Mrs. Macron. This is a wonderful national celebration, and we look very much forward to it. It will be spectacular tomorrow: Bastille Day.
We're honored to be here in your beautiful country—and it certainly is a beautiful country—with its proud history and its magnificent people. And thank you for the tour of some of the most incredible buildings anywhere in the world. I was very, very—a very beautiful thing to see. Thank you.
When the French people rose up and stormed the Bastille, it changed the course of human history. Our two nations are forever joined together by the spirit of revolution and the fight for freedom. France is America's first and oldest ally. A lot of people don't know that. Ever since General Lafayette joined the American fight for independence, our fates and fortunes have been tied unequivocally together. It was a long time ago, but we are together, and I think together, perhaps, more so than ever. The relationship is very good.
This visit also commemorates another milestone. One century ago, the United States entered World War I. And when the President called me, he had mentioned that fact—a hundred years ago—that was—I said, Mr. President, I will be there. That's a big, important date. One hundred years.
We remember the tens of thousands of Americans who gave their lives in that valiant and very difficult struggle. We also pay tribute to the heroic deeds of the French troops whose courage at the Battle of Marne and countless other battles will never be forgotten by us. More than 1 million French soldiers laid down their lives in defense of liberty. Their sacrifice is an eternal tribute to France and to freedom. French and American patriots have fought together, bled together, and died together in the fight for our countries and our civilizations.
Today, we face new threats from rogue regimes like North Korea, Iran, and Syria and the governments that finance and support them. We also face grave threats from terrorist organizations that wage war on innocent lives. Tomorrow will mark 1 year since a joyous Bastille Day celebration in Nice turned into a massacre. We all remember that, how horrible that was. We mourn the 86 lives that were stolen, and we pray for their loved ones. We also renew our resolve to stand united against these enemies of humanity and to strip them of their territory, their funding, their networks, and ideological support.
Today President Macron and myself discussed how we can strengthen our vital security partnerships. We just had a meeting with our generals and our representatives, and it went very well. France has excellent counterterrorism capabilities. The French troops are serving bravely in places like Mali to defeat these forces of murder and destruction. The United States and our allies strengthen our commitments to defeat terrorism.
We're also making tremendous progress. Earlier this week, with the strong support of the United States and the Global Coalition, Iraq forces liberated the city of Mosul from ISIS control. Now we must work with the Government of Iraq and our partners and allies in the region to consolidate the gains and ensure that the victory stays a victory, unlike the last time.
Last week, the G-20 leaders also reaffirmed the right to sovereign nations to control their borders. We must be strong from within to defend ourselves from threats from the outside. The nations of the West also face domestic challenges of our own creation, including vast government bureaucracy that saps the strength from our economies and from our societies.
For this reason, I applaud President Macron on his courageous call for that ""less bureaucracy."" It's a good chant: ""Less bureaucracy."" We can use it too. [Laughter] And a Europe that protects its citizens. We did not become great through regulation—and in the United States, Mr. President, we also have cut regulations at a level that we've never seen before, so we're very proud of that, over the last 6 months—but by allowing our people to follow their dreams. That's what it's all about. To achieve these dreams, however, we must also confront unfair trade practices that hurt our workers and pursue trade deals that are reciprocal and fair.
Both President Macron and I understand our responsibility to prioritize the interests of our countries and, at the same time, to be respectful of the world in which we live. We live in a very complex world. We have to respect it. The United States remains committed to being a leader in environmental protection while we advance energy security and economic growth. The friendship between our two nations—and ourselves, I might add—is unbreakable. Our occasional disagreements are nothing compared to the immortal bonds of culture, destiny, and liberty that unite us. So strongly unite us also. As long as we have pride in who we are, where we've come from, how we got here, and what we've achieved as free and democratic nations, then there is nothing we cannot accomplish together.
France helped us secure our independence. A lot of people forget. In the American Revolution, thousands of French soldiers fought alongside American troops so that, as Lafayette said, liberty would have a country. Ever since then, courageous heroes from both nations have fought for the same noble values and the same righteous cause.
Tomorrow the French Tricolor will once again wave proudly alongside the American Stars and Stripes. Our brave soldiers will march side by side, and we will all be inspired to protect and cherish the birthright of freedom that our ancestors won for us with their sweat and with their blood.
President Macron, thank you for inviting Melania and myself to this historic celebration. And to you and your spectacular country: May God bless France, and may God bless America.
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.
President Macron. Thank you. Very well. I think we will be taking four questions.
Neither President Trump nor myself have a microphone. [Laughter]
President Trump. [Inaudible]
Q. Mr. President. Mr. President. Mr. President.
President Trump. He's getting first question, President?
Paris Agreement on Climate Change 
[The reporter spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Q. A question from LCI, sir. A question for President Macron regarding what you said on the occasion of the press conference together with Chancellor Merkel. Do you still hope that President Trump or did you still hope that President Trump could change his mind regarding the Paris accord? And now, President Trump, is it possible for you to come back to the Paris accord and change your mind?
Next, regarding your relations, how would you describe it today? What about the dinner tonight? Is it going to be a dinner between friends?
President Macron. Well, regarding climate, well, we have a number of disagreements, which are in particular due to the commitments taken by President Trump vis-à-vis his—during the Presidential campaign—so did I. I'm aware of how important that that is, but we, therefore, talked about our disagreement. And we actually discussed the matter even before President Trump reached the decision.
Next, should that have an impact on the discussions we are having on all other topics? No, absolutely not. This is the reason why we share the same views and some major common goals on many other topics, on all other topics, which we've been discussing today and we shall move forward together. Next, well of course, President Trump will tell you about it, but he's made a number of commitments, and we're going to be working together, and my willingness to continue to work with the United States and the President on these very major topics. I understand that it's important to save jobs. That being said, we shall leave the United States of America work on what is its roadmap and continue to talk about it.
So today there is nothing new, unprecedented; otherwise, we would have told you about it. But I believe there is a joint willingness to continue to talk about this and try and find the best possible agreement. As far as I'm concerned, I am very much remain extremely attached to the framework of the Paris accord, which has been a major international breakthrough, and it is within that framework that I'm working on our priorities, including for the European Unions.
Lastly, as you know, I never very much want to comment who we are and what we are doing personally. But I can tell you that this evening, at the Eiffel Tower, it will be a dinner between friends, because we are the representatives of two countries which have been allies forever and because we've been able to build a strong relation which is dear to me, because it matters a great deal for both our countries. It will, therefore, give me great pleasure to have dinner together with you tonight.
President Trump. I think that I can reiterate. We have a very good relationship, a good friendship. And we look forward to dinner tonight at the Eiffel Tower. That will be something special. And yes, I mean, something could happen with respect to the Paris accord. We'll see what happens. But we will talk about that over the coming period of time. And if it happens, that will be wonderful. And if it doesn't, that will be okay too. But we'll see what happens.
But we did discuss many things today, including the cease-fire in Syria. And we discussed the Ukraine. We discussed a lot of different topics. We briefly hit on the Paris accord. And we'll see what happens, okay?
Yes, ma'am. Go ahead.
Federal Bureau of Investigation/Donald J. Trump, Jr./2016 Presidential Election 
Q. Thank you. Merci, Mr. President. Mr. President, your FBI nominee said if someone in a campaign got an email about Russia, like the one that your son Don Jr., received, that they should alert the FBI rather than accept that meeting. Is he wrong? Also, were you misled by your team in not knowing about this meeting?
And, Mr. President, thank you very much. You have heard President Trump say that it may have been Russia, it may have been others, who interfered with the U.S. election. Is President Trump taking a hard enough line on Russia, as you see it? Merci.
President Trump. Well, I'll start off by saying, first of all, I believe that we will have a great FBI Director. I think he's doing really well, and we're very proud of that choice. I think I've done a great service to the country by choosing him. He will make us all proud, and I think someday we'll see that, and, hopefully, someday soon. So we're very proud of him.
As far as my son is concerned, my son is a wonderful young man. He took a meeting with a Russian lawyer, not a government lawyer, but a Russian lawyer. It was a short meeting. It was a meeting that went very, very quickly, very fast. Two of the people in the room, they—I guess one of them left almost immediately and the other one was not really focused on the meeting. I do think this: I think from a practical standpoint, most people would have taken that meeting. It's called opposition research or even research into your opponent. I've had many people—I have only been in politics for 2 years—but I've had many people call up, ""Oh, gee, we have information on this factor or this person, or frankly, Hillary."" That's very standard in politics. Politics is not the nicest business in the world, but it's very standard where they have information and you take the information.
In the case of Don, he listened. I guess they talked about, as I see it, they talked about adoption and some things. Adoption wasn't even a part of the campaign. But nothing happened from the meeting. Zero happened from the meeting. And honestly, I think the press made a very big deal over something that really a lot of people would do.
Now, the lawyer that went to the meeting, I see that she was in the Halls of Congress also. Somebody said that her visa or her passport to come into the country was approved by Attorney General Lynch. Now, maybe that's wrong. I just heard that a little while ago. But I was a little surprised to hear that. So she was here because of Lynch.
So, again, I have a son who's a great young man. He's a fine person. He took a meeting with a lawyer from Russia. It lasted for a very short period, and nothing came of the meeting. And I think it's a meeting that most people in politics probably would have taken.
Mr. President.
[President Macron spoke in English as follows.]
President Macron. Yes, to answer your question, I will not interfere in U.S. domestic policy. And I think it's always good between partners and allies not to interfere in others' domestic life.
President Trump. What a good answer that was. [Laughter]
[President Macron continued in English as follows.]
President Macron. And I do believe that both of us have a direct relationship with Russia. President Trump had a 2 hours—more than 2 hours' meeting with President Putin during this past G-20. So that's—and I myself had two very long meetings with President Putin: the very first one in Versailles and the second one during the G-20. And this relationship is very important. We have a lot of disagreements. We have a lot of discrepancies, obviously, with Russia. But in the current environment, especially in Middle East, it's a necessity to work together, to exchange information, to share disagreements, and to try to build solutions.
So that's my relationship with Russia. And we don't have, obviously, the same relationship as the one with the U.S. But that's a longstanding relationship with Russia as well, and I think it's important that both of us have direct discussion and contact with the President Putin.
President Trump. One of the great things that came out of that meeting, by the way—even though it's not part of the question—was the fact that we got a cease-fire that now has lasted for, I guess, Mr. President, almost 5 days. And while 5 days doesn't sound like a long period of time, in terms of a cease-fire in Syria, that's a very long period of time. And that was a result of having communication with a country. So during that 5-year—5-day period, a lot of lives have been saved. A lot of people were not killed. No shots have been fired in a very, very dangerous part of the world, and this is one of the most dangerous parts of Syria itself.
So by having some communication and dialogue, we were able to have this cease-fire, and it's going to go on for a while. And frankly, we're working on a second cease-fire in a very rough part of Syria. And if we get that and a few more, all of a sudden, you're going to have no bullets being fired in Syria. And that would be a wonderful thing.
Mr. President, you have a question.
[President Macron spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
President Macron. Third question.
President Trump's View of President Macron 
[The reporter spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Q. From BFMTV, a question to President Macron. You went to Lausanne in order to support Paris's bid for the Olympic Games, and on this occasion, you somehow criticized President Trump's policy without naming him. You said that France made a very clear choice to leave his—its border open and not to build walls to protect its people. Do you condemn the Muslim ban and the building of the wall between the United States and Mexico?
Regarding Syria, as it was just mentioned by President Trump, is France yet ready to talk directly with Bashar al-Asad in the negotiation that you mentioned?
[The reporter spoke in English as follows.]
You've mentioned a friend, Jim, who told you that Paris is no longer Paris. You were implying at the time that Paris was not safe anymore. You've also said that France and Germany are infected by terrorism, and, quote, ""it's their fault because they let people enter their territory."" Those are very strong words. Would you repeat them today? And do you still believe that France is not able to fight terrorism on its own territory? Thank you.
President Trump. You'd better let me answer that one first. That's a beauty. [Laughter] He's the one that asked the question. That wasn't even one of my picks.
You know what, it's going to be just fine, because you have a great President. You have somebody that's going to run this country right. And I would be willing to bet because I think this is one of the great cities, one of the most beautiful cities in the world, and you have a great leader now. You have a great President; you have a tough President. He's not going to be easy on people that are breaking the laws and people that show this tremendous violence.
So I really have a feeling that you're going to have a very, very peaceful and beautiful Paris, and I'm coming back. [Laughter] You'd better do a good job, please. [Laughter] Otherwise, you're going to make me look very bad.
[President Macron spoke in English as follows.]
President Macron. And you're always welcome.
President Trump. Thank you.
[President Macron spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
President Macron. Regarding the first question, like I said, I believe that the discussions that we've had today is the proper answer to terrorism. The right answer—strengthen cooperation between our services and never-ending fight against terrorists no matter where they are—this is what I was referring to; this is what we're working on actively together. So, in this respect, there is no difference and no gap between the French and the American positions. When I have something to say, I say it clearly, and I do say who I'm aiming at. And when I refer to those who have been my opponents in the French political battle, I also mention the names. So let us not mix up everything.
And regarding the fight against terrorism, I think the right approach is to have a strengthened cooperation in the field of intelligence—is also to be working together on all the theaters of operation where we are. And I think that the decisions we've reached today, they will enable us to do more.
Next, your question regarding Bashar al-Asad, which is an important one. Let me put it simply: Indeed, we now have a new approach of Syria because we want some results and we want to be closely working together with our partners, including the United States of America. We have one main goal, which is to eradicate terrorism. No matter who they are, we want to build an inclusive and sustainable political solution. Against that background, I do not require Asad's departure. This is no longer a prerequisite for France to work on that, because I can only tell you that for 7 years we did not have an Embassy in Damascus, and still we have no solution.
Next, we also have a common redline together with President Trump. He intervened before I was elected, and I said it to President Putin after my election: No use whatsoever of chemical weapons. Any use will lead to reaction—an attack against a reaction regarding the storage places.
And next, we also want humanitarian corridors. Also, we want to build a sustainable political stability for Syria. This is our roadmap. In order to stick to it, we need diplomatic initiative beyond our military actions. This is what we've been agreed upon—agreeing upon, because we want to take an initiative with the members of the Security Council and a number of countries involved in the process, in the matter. Of course, there will be representatives of Asad that will enable us to put in place the roadmap for after the war, but there will also be representatives of the Syrian opposition and people with different backgrounds, and we will talk to all of them against that background.
One last question for an American journalist.
President Xi Jinping of China/North Korea 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
President Trump. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Q. Phoenix TV of China.
[The reporter spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
For both Presidents: Mr. Macron, you had your first meeting with the Chinese President during the G-20 summit. What will France do? How will France cooperate with all of these areas with China? And what do you think personally of Mr. Xi Jinping?
[The reporter spoke in English as follows.]
You have just met Chinese President, during the G-20 summit. And what—how do you want continue to work with China? And what do you personally think about Mr. Xi Jinping? Thank you very much. President Trump. Well, he's a friend of mine. I have great respect for him. We've gotten to know each other very well. A great leader. He's a very talented man. I think he's a very good man. He loves China, I can tell you. He loves China. He wants to do what's right for China.
We've asked him for some assistance with respect to North Korea. Probably, he could do a little bit more, but we'll find out. We're now working on some trade deals. He's been very nice. He's let, as you know, beef go back in, certain financing go back in, credit card financing, and various other things go back in at my request, which is a great thing for our farmers. So a lot of good things are happening, but we're going to be working on some very major trade components.
But President Xi is a terrific guy. I like being with him a lot, and he's a very special person.
Okay? Thank you.
[President Macron spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
President Macron. I first talked to President Xi over the telephone; then, I got to meet him in the margin of the G-20 summit in Hamburg. Earlier—early next year, I will be traveling to China. We've agreed to it. So I cannot say that he's a friend of mine or that I know him very well, because I very much want to say things as they are. But we had some initial contacts which were extremely fruitful and positive.
I have a lot of respect for President Xi, and I would like to say that over the past few months he did express his willingness to have a vision for multilateralism and wanted to commit himself on a number of topics. I think that many of us remember his words in Davos, and he there very strongly expressed his vision of the role of China. We have a number of joint commitments, including on climate. He's very committed to that, and he told me that he wanted to do more in the field, and I can only be happy about it. He wants strong cooperation.
And like President Trump said, the—also the trade issues and regarding the number of activities—there are issues, there are differences, but a joint willingness to sort out—sort them out. And as permanent members of the Security Council, we want to work together on all of the topics we've been discussing today.
And China, in this respect, is a key partner in order to build peace all around the world, and I share what President Trump just said, that China is to play a very specific role regarding the rising tension, the growing tension in—with North Korea. And it's important that China can play fully its role in the region.
In summary, I think he is today one of the great leaders of our world, implementing a major and ambitious reform of China society and the economy in China. And therefore, my willingness, in this respect as well, is to have a strategic dialogue, the purpose of which is to continue to talk about the industry of—civil nuclear industry, economic matters, and talk about any difficulties we may have together.
Very well. Allow me to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and once again thank President Trump for his visit. And I will be seeing him in a few moments in a friendly atmosphere.
President Trump. Thank you very much. Great honor. Thank you.
President Macron. Thank you, my friend.
President Trump. Thank you. Pr",esident Macron. Thank you.
"August 28, 2017",The President's News Conference With President Sauli Niinistö of Finland,Donald J. Trump,"Donald J. Trump, The President's News Conference With President Sauli Niinistö of Finland Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/330995",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-sauli-niinisto-finland,"President Trump. Thank you. Thank you very much. It is my great honor to welcome President Niinistö to the White House. We've just concluded a very positive meeting.
And I want to begin today by extending my thoughts and prayers for those affected by Hurricane Harvey and the catastrophe of flooding and all of the other difficulties that they're currently going through in Houston, in Southeast Texas. And now it's looking more and more like the State of Louisiana will be also affected.
My administration is coordinating closely with State and local authorities in Texas and Louisiana to save lives, and we thank our first responders and all of those involved in their efforts. We're working directly with Texas Governor Greg Abbott—who, by the way, is doing a fantastic job—and his entire staff, likewise, as well as with Governor John Bel Edwards, who's very much involved in starting the process of Louisiana. We've pledged our full support as Texas and Louisiana battle and recover from this very devastating and historic storm. There's probably never been anything like this.
Under the supervision of FEMA Administrator Brock Long, there has been a tremendous amount of work done. He has been so outstanding in so many ways. More than 8,500 Federal workers are involved in the Texas effort alone. I've also today declared emergencies in Louisiana at the request of Governor Edwards.
Recovery will be a long and difficult road, and the Federal Government stands ready, willing, and able to support that effort. Right now the single most important thing is the safety and security of those still in harm's way, including the first responders who have been so terrific and brave. Protecting the lives of our people is my highest priority. Every asset at my command is at the disposal of local officials.
Tragic times such as these bring out the best in America's character. Strength, charity, and resilience are those characters. We see neighbor helping neighbor, friend helping friend, and stranger helping stranger. And you see that all over. You watch on television, you just see such incredible work and love and teamwork. We are one American family. We hurt together, we struggle together, and believe me, we endure together. We are one family.
To the people of Texas and Louisiana: We are 100 percent with you. We're praying for you; we're working closely with your leaders and officials. And I will be visiting the impact zone tomorrow to ensure that you're receiving full support and cooperation from the Federal Government. And on Saturday, we think we're going back to Texas, and also, we will be going to Louisiana.
Nothing can defeat the unbreakable spirit of people of Texas and Louisiana. Right now every American heart sends its love and support to those whose lives have been upended—totally upended, totally—by this very horrible storm.
We ask God for his wisdom and strength. We will get through this. We will come out stronger. And believe me, we will be bigger, better, stronger than ever before. The rebuilding will begin, and in the end, it will be something very special. And I just want to thank everybody in the affected area, because it has been absolutely incredible to watch: the spirit, the cooperation, and the love.
I would also like to share a message to the people of Finland who have recently suffered a terrorist attack in Turku: We stand in solidarity with you against the terrorist threat. We must all work together to deny terrorists safe havens, cut off their finances, and defeat their very wicked ideology.
Mr. President, Americans are grateful for your steadfast support as an ally in the fight against terrorism—appreciate it—including your membership in the coalition to defeat ISIS. Finland makes important contributions to the coalition and its effort in Afghanistan and has troops on the ground in Iraq training Iraqi soldiers.
In Afghanistan, Finland provides troops and financial contributions to support the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces on a modern-day frontier between barbarism and civilization. That's what you have: It's barbarism versus civilization. We are particularly grateful to the Finnish citizens who have sacrificed for our mutual security.
Finland is a leading expert in cybersecurity. In fact, we should be calling you pretty soon. You do do a fantastic job with cybersecurity, and I congratulate you. And I think in a very short period of time, we're going to be right there with you, believe me. The United States is a very proud partner of Finland's European Center of Excellence to counter modern threats, including cyberattacks.
In addition, we look forward to your leadership as chair of the Arctic Council. The Arctic region has strategic and economic importance for both of our nations, very much so.
The foundation of our friendship is our shared love of freedom. On behalf of all Americans, I congratulate you and the Finnish people on the 100th anniversary of Finland's independence—100 years. It's fantastic. In honor of Finland's centennial, the United States is contributing an additional half-million dollars to the Fulbright Finland Foundation. Through the Fulbright program, we are sending more of our best and brightest to Finland, forging lasting connections between Americans and Finns.
On the economic front, we seek fair and reciprocal trade to benefit both of our countries. I applaud Finnish companies for their commitment to increase investment in the United States, adding new technologies and adding good jobs for hard-working Americans. Thank you.
The U.S.-Finnish partnership is rooted in our shared interests and common values. As President—and I must say, and I want to thank you, President—we've discussed and we look forward to further strengthening these bonds of culture, commerce, and cooperation between our two countries so that our citizens and our nations can thrive and prosper together.
Mr. President, I'd like to thank you very much for being at the White House, and we had a great meeting in the Oval Office. It's my honor to have you here. Thank you. Thank you very much.
President Niinistö. Mr. President, I want to thank you for your very kind words. And I just want to tell you that it is a great pleasure and honor to be here today. I thank you also for the discussions we have had. They have been of most interest.
President Trump. Thank you.
President Niinistö. We have been closely following Hurricane Harvey. Our thoughts are with the people of Texas and Louisiana. They and you, Mr. President, have shown strength and courage to overcome this catastrophe. It has been touching to watch the TV and see how people help each other. That is what we basically are built of: helping each other.
Finland highly appreciates our close relationship with the United States. Today, they are broader than ever, ranging from security to defense cooperation, to trade and innovation. We are indeed celebrating our hundred years of independence. I want to thank you for the generous gift presented to the Fulbright Finland Foundation.
I want to also—to take this opportunity to greet the almost 700,000 Americans who have Finnish origin. Mr. President and I exchanged views on several international issues. Our broad headline was security. We discussed the importance of the transatlantic bond between the European Union and the United States. History has taught us Europeans the value of unity.
The U.S. and NATO presence in Europe are—and in Baltic Sea—are most important, and they are increasing rapidly. Finland is doing its part. We promote dialogue. To reduce risks, Finland has proposed steps to improve flight safety in the Baltic Sea area. They are small, but positive steps in reopening dialogue between NATO and Russia. We remain committed to supporting Afghanistan, and we are a dedicated member of the global coalition against ISIS.
Finland took the chairmanship of the Arctic Council from the United States in May. We can't afford losing the pristine Arctic nature. Finland firmly believes that business and environment can both be winners in the Arctic. A good example is reducing black carbon.
Mr. President, I'm looking forward to even closer cooperation with you and your great nation. I want to thank you. Thank you.
President Trump. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
So we'll take a couple of questions. How about we go to Texas? Todd Gillman [Dallas Morning News]. Todd. Hello, Todd.
Hurricane Harvey Response and Recovery Efforts 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
President Trump. Yes.
Q. I'm wondering what you can tell the people of Texas to expect in terms of long-term recovery efforts. And in particular, you have been feuding with some key congressional leaders. You've also threatened a Government shutdown, potentially next month, over border wall funding. Are these going to hamper long-term—the funding that will be needed long term for recovery?
President Trump. No, Todd. I think that you're going to very rapid action from Congress, certainly from the President. And you're going to get your funding. It's a terrible tragedy. Your Governor has been absolutely outstanding in the job he's done and his entire staff.
And I will say that—I just spoke with Greg, and he is working, like, 24/7. We expect to have requests on our desk fairly soon, and we think that Congress will feel very much the way I feel. Very—in a very bipartisan way, that will be nice. But we think you're going to have what you need, and it's going to go fast.
Texas is a unique place. It's a great, great State, great people, and I think you you'll be up and running very, very quickly. Really, very quickly. So yes, I think you're going to be in fantastic shape. I've already spoken to Congress, and everybody feels for you and feels for what you're going through. But at the same time, they have great respect—even additional respect for the State—because you've handled it so well, so brilliantly.
But it's a long road. Still pouring, still a lot of rain. Nobody has ever seen anything like it. They've—I've heard the words ""epic,"" I've heard ""historic""—that's what it is. But you will have what you want, I think, very, very quickly.
Q. Does this——
The President. And, Todd, you can ask a question to the President too.
Hurricane Harvey Response and Recovery Efforts/Federal Government Shutdown 
Q. Sure, thank you. Does this situation make you reconsider the possibility of a Government shutdown next month?
President Trump. I think it has nothing to do with it, really. I think this is separate. This is going to go really very, very quickly. Again, I have spoken to many of the people we're talking about, and everybody feels the same way I do.
Q. Thank you. And, Mr. President, I wanted to ask you: Your neighbor Russia has meddled in U.S. politics. They have a military exercise coming up in the next few weeks. In the Baltic, there are tensions over there. What kind of advice have you offered, and can you offer, to the United States in dealing with this adversary?
President Niinistö. Sir, we are not feeling ourselves as advisers, but we are feeling ourselves as doing all what is possible to maintain peace. And that is what we are doing in Baltic Sea area too.
With the—actually, you refer to a different kind of military training, which is going to happen there. I have to tell you that a couple of weeks ago, I met President Putin, and there were media interested in why Chinese Navy is having training together with Russians in Baltic Sea area. Putin answered that it is not a bloc; it's not against anybody. My answer was that we are also training in Baltic Sea with United States and Sweden, and it's not a bloc; it's not against anybody.
So we have to be very careful that this huge training, huge military trafficking over Baltic doesn't cause any accidental problems. Because we know that from accidents might grow whatever. And that is why I think it's important that we continue to work with NATO to enhance, like I said, dialogue between Russia and NATO. And it is going forward.
President Trump. You have a question?
President Niinistö. Finnish Broadcasting Company. Where you are? Okay.
Baltic States 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question to President Trump, if I may. As President Niinistö told, he's been raising the issue about the security situation in the Baltic region and the Baltic Sea, specifically, and has been concerned about the Russian planes flying there without transponders on. So my question to you, Mr. President, would be: Mr. Trump, would you consider Russia as a security threat? Thank you.
President Trump. Well, I consider many countries as a security threat, unfortunately, when you look at what's going on in the world today. As you know, a few weeks ago our great Vice President, Mike Pence, who's right here, was in the region and spent quite a bit of time there. We consider that a very, very important part of the world. We have great relationships there. We have a great relationship with Finland.
And so I would consider many countries threats, but these are all threats that we'll be able to handle if we have to. Hopefully, we won't have to handle them, but if we do, we will handle them.
Baltic States 
Q. Can I have a follow-up, as he had also? So if the situation in the Baltic were to escalate, what would the U.S. be ready to do in that unfortunate circumstances? Thanks.
President Trump. Well, we are very protective of that region. That's all I can say. We are very, very protective. We have great friends there, great relationships there. We are extremely protective. Okay? Thank you.
Q. Thank you, sir.
President Trump. A question for the President? Yes.
President Niinistö. No. Sometimes, he——
President Trump. Do you have a question for the President? Do you have a question for the President?
Q. What if——
President Trump. It's all right. Somebody else could.
President Niinistö. You don't have to. [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President—[inaudible]—from Finland.
President Niinistö. Okay.
Arctic Region/Environment 
Q. Did you speak about climate change at all? And what about your, Mr. President Niinistö, initiative about cleaning up the Arctic and doing it together with the United States? What kind of response did your idea receive here in Washington, DC?
President Niinistö. We discussed a lot about black carbon. And to explain to everybody: What happens is that, from atmosphere, black carbon covers the Arctic, and we know what happens when sunshine meets black. It melts the ice. And the problem is not only Arctic; if we lose the Arctic, we lose the globe. That is reality.
So we must fight against those emissions spreading black carbon. I understood that the United States is going to put it in half, and we know that black carbon sources are a lot of them in Russia. They are old-fashioned energy plants producing heating. The other problem is flaring. You know that in oil fields they flare up the extra gas, and the amount is huge. Yearly, they flare 40 times more than Finland spends gas.
So if we can—and here comes also a business to picture—it would be a good business to renew those old-fashioned plants, to make more with less energy. It would be a business to stop flaring, to take use of that gas which is now burned for wind.
And I think that these elements are shots that we can continue discussing in Arctic Council. We have inherited the chairmanship from the United States, and we continue the work. President Trump. We had a very good discussion——
President Niinistö. Yes. 
President Trump. ——in particular, on the Arctic and black carbon. And I think we have much in agreement.
One of the things we also agree on: We want crystal-clean water, and we want clean air, the cleanest ever. Very important. So we have a lot of agreement.
John Roberts [Fox News]. Yes.
Former Sheriff Joseph M. Arpaio of Maricopa County, AZ/Presidential Pardons and Commutations 
Q. Mr. President, thank you so much. President Niinistö, I have a question for you as well, but if I could start with President Trump. In the middle of Hurricane Harvey hitting on Friday night, you chose to pardon former Sheriff Joe Arpaio. I wonder if you could tell us what was behind your thinking for issuing the pardon for the sheriff. And as well, what do you say to your critics, even some in your own party, who say it was the wrong thing to do?
President Trump. Well, a lot of people think it was the right thing to do, John. And actually, in the middle of a hurricane, even though it was a Friday evening, I assumed the ratings would be far higher than they would be normally. You know, the hurricane was just starting, and I put it out that I had pardoned, as we call—as we say, Sheriff Joe.
He's done a great job for the people of Arizona. He's very strong on borders, very strong on illegal immigration. He is loved in Arizona. I thought he was treated unbelievably unfairly when they came down with their big decision to go get him right before the election voting started, as you know. And he lost in a fairly close election. He would have won the election, but they just hammered him just before the election. I thought that was a very, very unfair thing to do.
When I mentioned him the other night—you saw the massive crowd we had—the people went crazy when I said, ""What do you think of Sheriff Joe?"" or something to that effect. The place went absolutely crazy when I was in Arizona last week.
And as far as pardons are concerned, I actually did this just before the meeting, because I assumed that somebody would ask me the question. I didn't know it would be you, as you can attest. You didn't even know you were going to be called. But I thought I would. And you know, Sheriff Joe is a great veteran of the military, great law enforcement person, somebody that's won many, many elections in the State of Arizona. But I wanted to look at some of the other people that were pardoned over the years.
And if you look at, as an example, President Clinton pardoned Marc Rich, who was charged with crimes going back decades, including illegally buying oil from Iran while it held 53 American hostages—wasn't allowed to do that—selling to the enemies of the United States. He was pardoned after his wife donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Clintons.
Then, you have dangerous criminals. President Clinton pardoned Susan Rosenberg, a member of the Weathered Underground, charged as part of a bank robbery that led to a guard and two police officers being killed. Drug dealers: President Clinton commuted the sentence of Carlos Vignali, a central player in a cocaine ring that stretched from California to Minnesota. Criminal leaker, you've heard the word ""leaker."" President Obama commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning, who leaked countless sensitive and classified documents to WikiLeaks, perhaps and others. But a horrible, horrible thing that he did. Commuted the sentence and perhaps pardoned. President Obama commuted the sentence of Oscar Lòpez Rivera, who was charged as part of a violent independence group from Puerto Rico, responsible for 28 Chicago-area bombings and many deaths in the 1970s and 1980s.
Sheriff Joe is a patriot. Sheriff Joe loves our country. Sheriff Joe protected our borders. And Sheriff Joe was very unfairly treated by the Obama administration, especially right before an election, an election that he would have won. So—and he was elected many times. So I stand by my pardon of Sheriff Joe, and I think the people of Arizona, who really know him best, would agree with me.
Thank you very much.
Q. Mr. President, I'd like to claim prescience that you did all the research, but I'm afraid I have to confess, the question was fairly obvious.
And President Niinistö, I'm sure that President Trump either briefed you today, or you're aware of his new plan for Afghanistan that really relies, at its core, in bringing the Taliban to the table for negotiations. Given the history and the ideology of the Taliban, do you ever believe that they would honor any kind of an agreement that was ever made? Or would they, when the United States and Finland and other countries leave Afghanistan, renege on that deal?
President Niinistö. Yes, first of all, I want to underline that Finland has been involved, from the very beginning, to all the attempts to solve the situation in Afghanistan. We have troops there. We have also financial aid going on all the time.
We have to try. We have to try in all possible ways to solve the situation in Afghanistan. It has been ongoing quite a long time, for decades. But to solve it by negotiations, surely, you have to have full respect to the one you negotiate and to also full belief that what is negotiated is also fulfilled. These elements has to be all the time present when you discuss with whichever party in Afghanistan.
President Trump. Okay?
President Niinistö. Yes.
President Trump. I know there might be a couple of more questions, but do you want to take one more? Would you want to take one more? Go ahead, pick. [Laughter] Go ahead.
President Niinistö. Please.
President Trump. Again? You're going to give her the same one?
President Niinistö. No, she's not the same lady. [Laughter]
President Trump. Other one. Go ahead.
President Niinistö. They are sitting side by side.
Q. We have a lot of blonde women in Finland.
President Trump. Go ahead.
Russia-U.S. Relations/Finland-Russia Relations Q. Mr. President Trump, what kind of role do you see as Finland having in the U.S.-Russia relations? Do you think Finland could be of assistance, helping U.S. get better relations with Russia?
President Trump. Well, I hope that we do have good relations with Russia. I say it loud and clear; I've been saying it for years: I think it's a good thing if we have great relationships or at least good relationships with Russia. That's very important, and I believe someday that will happen. It's a big country, it's a nuclear country, it's a country that we should get along with, and I think we will eventually get along with Russia.
Finland is respected by Russia. Finland has been free of Russia, really—just about one of the few countries in the region that has been—for a hundred years. And Russia has a lot of respect for Finland, so that's always good. But I think Finland is doing fine with Russia, and I hope that the United States will someday be able to have a very good relationship with Russia also. I think that's very good for world peace and for other things.
Thank you.
Finland-U.S. Relations/Finland's Military Capacity 
Q. As a follow-up, if Finland's relationship with Russia were to deteriorate, would the U.S.—what kind of assistance would the U.S. be willing to give to Finland bilaterally if we needed it?
President Trump. Well, as I said before, that, you know, our relationship with Finland is a very close one, and we're always ready to help Finland. One of the things that is happening is, you're purchasing large amounts of our great F-18 aircraft from Boeing, and it's one of the great planes, one of the great fighter jets, and you're purchasing lots of other military equipment and, I think, purchasing very wisely. I know all of the military equipment, and I actually agree with everything you purchased. We talked about it before.
I think Finland is really a respected country militarily. It's got large armed forces for its size as a country, really, proportionally, probably one of the biggest in the world if you think of it.
President Niinistö. I guess so.
President Trump. But they're very respected militarily, and they're respected beyond militarily. So, hopefully, it will never come to that. Thank you.
Q. And President Niinistö? President Niinistö, did you discuss Russia? And did you offer any assistance to the U.S. with their relationship with Russia?
President Niinistö. Well, we, like I said earlier on, we did discuss about Russia. But actually, I don't feel myself or Finland being any adviser to anybody, but we try to do our best, and hopefully, we get also results from that.
I want to remind you that, in NATO meeting, a year ago approximately, it was stated by all NATO countries that with Russia you have to be deterrence, but you have to exercise dialogue too. These two-way elements have to be there.
President Trump. Yes, go ahead.
Federal Emergency Management Agency/Hurricane Harvey Response and Recovery Efforts Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Trey Yingst with One America News. In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, do you believe that cutting FEMA's budget is the right thing to do?
President Trump. No, I think what's going to happen is, the FEMA money is relatively small compared to the rebuilding money. So FEMA, right now we have the money necessary for Texas and Louisiana, if we need, but the all—the real number, which will be many billions of dollars, will go through Congress. I think it'll happen very quickly, it'll go very fast, and I want to congratulate you on the network. It's a great network.
Mexico/Border Security/North American Free Trade Agreement 
Q. Thank you. If I may follow up on one other question from earlier.
President Trump. Yes.
Q. The southern border wall. Is your plan still to have Mexico pay for the wall?
President Trump. Yes, it will. One way or the other, Mexico's going to pay for the wall. That's right.
Q. Sir——
President Trump. It may be through reimbursement, but one way or the other, Mexico will pay for the wall.
We're right now negotiating NAFTA. In my opinion, Mexico has been very difficult, as they should be. Why wouldn't they be? They had a sweetheart deal for so many years. It's one of the great deals of all time for them. One of the worst trade deals ever signed. I guarantee you, Mr. President, Finland would never have signed NAFTA with Russia or whoever you wanted. [Laughter] This is not a deal that you would want to sign. This is not a deal that Finland would know about. [Laughter]
NAFTA is one of the worst trade deals ever signed at any time, anywhere in the world. And I can understand why Mexico is being difficult, because why wouldn't they be? They've had it their way.
But no, Mexico will pay for the wall. It may be through a reimbursement. We need the wall very badly. As you know, Mexico has a tremendous crime problem—tremendous—one of the number two or three in the world. And that's another reason we need it. And the—just to add on, tremendous drugs are pouring into the United States at levels that nobody has ever seen before. This happened over the last 3 to 4 years in particular. The wall will stop much of the drugs from pouring into this country and poisoning our youth.
So we need the wall. It's imperative. We may fund it through the United States. But ultimately, Mexico will pay for the wall.
Federal Government Shutdown/Mexico/Border Security/North American Free Trade Agreement/Canada 
Q. Sir, if I may follow up. On Tuesday, you said, if we have to close down our Government, we are building that wall.
President Trump. Well, I hope that's not necessary——
Q. If Mexico is paying for wall, why would we close down our Government? President Trump. Let me just tell you, yes, I hope that's not necessary. If it's necessary, we'll have to see. But I hope it's not necessary. The wall is needed from the standpoint of security. The wall is needed from the standpoint of drug—tremendous, the drug scourge, what's coming and the—through that area, through the areas that we're talking about. As you know, I have General Kelly here. We stopped traffic coming through, 78 percent. It's going to be, I think, 81 percent this quarter, which is a record. In other administrations, if they stopped it just a little bit, like 1 or 2 or 3 percent, they considered that a great thing. We're up to almost 80 percent. We'll soon be over 80 percent.
But you need the wall to do the rest, and you need the wall for the drugs. The drugs are a tremendous problem. The wall will greatly help with the drug problem, and ultimately, that's a good thing for Mexico also. We have a very good relationship with Mexico, but I will say that dealing with them—I've always said—I've talked about NAFTA, you've heard me many times—and I've said that we will either terminate it or renegotiate it.
We're in the process of renegotiating right now, renegotiating the deal. I believe that you will probably have to at least start the termination process before a fair deal could be arrived at, because it's been a one-sided deal. And this includes Canada, by the way. Great respect for Canada, great love for Canada, but it's been a one-sided deal for Canada and for Mexico.
And the United States workers, all of these incredible people who have lost their jobs because of NAFTA, they're not going to be suffering any longer. It's been unfair for too long.
So we will build the wall, and we will stop a lot of things, including the drug—the drugs are pouring in at levels like nobody has ever seen. We'll be able to stop them once the wall is up.
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, everybody.
President Niinistö. Thank you."
"October 16, 2017",The President's News Conference With Senate Majority Leader A. Mitchell McConnell,Donald J. Trump,"Donald J. Trump, The President's News Conference With Senate Majority Leader A. Mitchell McConnell Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/331193",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-senate-majority-leader-mitchell-mcconnell,"The President. Thank you very much. I just want to say that we just spent quite a bit of time inside with the Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, who has been a friend of mine for a long time, long before my world of politics, early into his world of politics, I think. [Laughter] But we've been friends for a long time. We are probably now, despite what we read, we're probably now—I think, at least as far as I'm concerned—closer than ever before. And the relationship is very good.
We're fighting for the same thing. We're fighting for lower taxes, big tax cuts, the biggest tax cuts in the history of our Nation. We're fighting for tax reform as part of that. We are getting close to health care. It will come up in the early to mid-part of next year. We're going to have a vote; I think we already have the votes. We feel confident we have the votes. You pretty much know what the plan is.
I believe Republicans and Democrats are, as we speak, working together very hard, right now—working together to do an intermediate plan, a short-term plan, because Obamacare is a disaster. The rates have gone up. The premiums have gone up. The deductibles have gone through the roof. I mean, it's terrible. If you look at the deductibles, unless you really have a problem, you're not going to be able to use them.
So we have been working together long and hard. We think we're in good shape for the budget, we hope. And we hope to be in good shape with, again, the largest tax cuts ever passed in this country. It's going to spur business. You look at other countries, what they've done, and we're competing with other countries. When China is at 15 percent, when I hear that Ireland is going to be reducing their corporate rates down to 8 percent from 12. But you have other countries also reducing. We can't be at 35 percent and think we're going to remain competitive in terms of companies and in terms of jobs. So we worked on that.
I was very honored to see a man that I've had a lot of respect for, James Lee Witt, of the Clinton administration—the head of FEMA. He gave us an A-plus; I just see—it just came out. And I've always had respect for him. He gave us—he's the FEMA director of the Clinton administration—gave us an A-plus for how we responded to the hurricane aftermath, all of the hurricanes. And that includes Puerto Rico.
So I just want to thank Mr. Witt, wherever you may be now, wherever you may be listening. I just want to say, I really much appreciate it. Because that took it out of politics—out of the world of politics, in that he was with the Clinton administration and I'm sure remains loyal to the Clinton administration. I hope he does.
So just to finish off, my relationship with this gentleman is outstanding, has been outstanding. We are working very hard to get the tax cuts. We will continue to work hard to get the health care completed. I'm going to be surprising some people with an economic development bill later on, but I haven't even told Mitch, because I want to focus on tax cuts and some other things right now.
One of the unspoken elements that we discussed at lunch—and it just is not talked about—yes, we got a great Justice—Justice Gorsuch—into the United States Supreme Court. He is going to be outstanding, hopefully, for many, many years. But something that people aren't talking about is how many judges we've had approved, whether it be the court of appeals, circuit judges, whether it be district judges. We have—tremendous—right now under review; the Democrats are holding them up beyond anything—beyond comprehension, they're holding them up.
I mean, frankly, they have terrible, terrible policy—terrible policy—and perhaps they're not even good politicians, but they are good at obstruction. So I looked at some of these numbers, between the judges—and I want to say that we will set records in terms of the number of judges.
And if you read the Wall Street Journal, I have to give them a little bit of a—a person, a writer, I won't mention names—but you can see who has really been a really fair person—wrote an article or wrote an editorial, in a sense, saying how well we're doing with judges and appointments. I think it's one of the big unsung things of this administration, in addition to the fact that we have had a lot of legislation passed on the VA and lots of other things.
But the judge story is an untold story. Nobody wants to talk about it. But when you think about it, Mitch and I were saying, that has consequences 40 years out, depending on the age of the judge, but 40 years out. So numerous have been approved. Many, many are in the pipeline. The level of quality is extraordinary.
And I just wanted to say that we're working very closely on that also and getting really great reviews from those people and, in many cases, some scholars that have been studying it. There has never been anything like what we've been able to do together with judges.
So with that, I'd like to have Mitch say a few words, and if you want to do a little question-and-answer, we can do that also.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Leader McConnell. Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. I want to underscore what the President said. We have the same agenda. We've been friends and acquaintances for a long time. We talk frequently. We don't give you a readout every time we have a conversation. But frequently we talk on the weekends about the issues that are before us.
Obviously, passing the budget, which enables tax reform and tax reduction comes next, then a supplemental to take adequate care of those who have been harmed by the natural disasters we've been afflicted with lately. And of course, the Senate's unique role—that it seems to me, a lot of people forget—we're in the personnel business. There are 1,200 of the President's nominations subject to confirmation in the Senate. The House is not in the personnel business. We are.
The single most significant thing this President has done to change America is the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. But it's not just the Supreme Court. There are a lot of vacancies at both the circuit court and district court level, as the President has indicated, young, conservative—and when we say conservative about a judge, what we're talking about here are, the kind of the people the President is appointing to the courts believe that the role of a judge is to try to rule based upon what the law says, not what they hoped the outcome would be.
As Justice Scalia used to say, if the judge is not occasionally unhappy with the conclusion he reached, he's not a very good judge. Or as Justice Gorsuch put it down in my State a couple of weeks ago, judges don't wear red, they don't wear blue—they wear black. And those are the kind of people the President is sending up to the Senate to be confirmed. Many of them, as he pointed out, younger, that will be on the bench for a long time and have a great deal to do with what kind of country we're going to have far into the future.
Legislatively, obviously the top priority is tax reduction. And I think what the President and I would both like to say to you today, contrary to what some of you may have reported: We are together totally on this agenda to move America forward.
The President. John [John Roberts, Fox News].
Tax Reform/Health Care Reform 
Q. Mr. President, in terms of the timetable for tax reform, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has said he wants to get it done by the end of this year. He would make the House stay through the Christmas break in order to get it done. The Senate Majority Leader has said we'll get it done this Congress. Would you be okay if tax reform were not passed until next year as opposed to this year?
The President. Well, I would like to see it be done this year, John.
Leader McConnell. I would too.
The President. I would like very much to see it be done this year. So we won't go a step further. If we get it done, that's a great achievement.
But don't forget it took years for the Reagan administration to get taxes done. I've been here for 9 months, a little more than 9 months. I can say the same thing for health care. If you look at Obama—first of all, you look at Clinton, they weren't able to get it done. You look at other administrations, they weren't able to get it done. President Obama, after a long period of time, was able to finally push it through, but pushed through something that's now failed—it's really failing badly. But again, we're meeting—Democrat, Republican are meeting right now, and right now they're working on something very special.
But I have to tell you, I really believe that we have a very good chance, and I think Mitch feels the same way of getting the——
Leader McConnell. Yes, let me——
The President. ——of getting the taxes done, hopefully, fairly long before the end of the year. That's what we'd like to see.
Go ahead.
Leader McConnell. Could I just add? Yes, let me just—let me just add to what the President said. The goal is to get it done this calendar year. But it is important to remember that Obama signed Obamacare in March of year 2. Obama signed Dodd-Frank in July of year 2. We're going to get this job done, and the goal is to get it done by the end of the year.
The President. And just to finish up for Mitch—and we're 9 months, right? So—[laughter].
Leader McConnell. Yes.
The President. So we could have a long way to go, but that's okay.
Yes. Health Care Reform/Office of National Drug Control Policy Director-Designate Thomas A. Marino/Opioid Crisis 
Q. Thank you very much.
The President. Thank you.
Q. Question, one, do you both have confidence in Representative Tom Marino to be your drug czar? And on health care, in a recent tweet, you said: ""The only problem I have with Mitch McConnell is that after hearing repeal and replace for 7 years, he failed. That should never have happened."" Do you still think he failed? Do you have confidence—[inaudible]?
The President. Well, let's go to the second part of your question, with Mitch. Again, we've been doing health care for, really, 7 months, and probably 6 months, if you think about it, because we started in probably a total of 6 months. Others were 2½ years and much more than that. Others were 8 years, and they didn't get it passed. This man is going to get it done, okay? And I think get it done long before anybody else, and I think it's going to be a great health care.
As far as Tom Marino, so he was a very early supporter of mine, the great State of Pennsylvania. He's a great guy. I did see the report. We're going to look into the report, and we're going to take it very seriously. Because we're going to have a major announcement, probably next week, on the drug crisis and on the opioid massive problem. And I want to get that absolutely right. This country—and frankly, the world—has a drug problem. The world has a drug problem. But we have it, and we're going to do something about it.
So I'm going to have a major announcement on that problem next week. We're going to be looking into Tom.
Former White House Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon/President's Relations With Congress/Republican Party 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Trey Yingst with One America News Network. I'd like to ask you: Do you support the plan by people who previously served in your administration, such as the Steve Bannon, to primary Republican candidates in the 2018 elections who do not support your agenda?
The President. Well, I have a very good relationship, as you know, with Steve Bannon. Steve has been a friend of mine for a long time. I like Steve a lot. Steve is doing what Steve thinks is the right thing. Some of the people that he may be looking at, I'm going to see if we talk him out of that, because, frankly, they're great people.
What Mitch will tell you is that maybe, with the exception of a few—and that is a very small few—I have a fantastic relationship with the people in the Senate and with the people in Congress. I mean, I have a—with our House of Representatives. I have a great relationship with political people. If you read the papers, you think, I'm, like, on one island and they're, like, on the other. Well, it's not the way it is.
We have a fantastic relationship. I'm friends with most of them, I can say. And I don't think anybody could have much of a higher percentage. But I'm friends with most of them. I like and respect most of them, and I think they like and respect me.
Just so you understand, the Republican Party is very, very unified. When we get things approved, we have to go through hell because we have no Democrat support, we have nobody. We don't have a vote from the Democrats. As an example, massive tax cuts, we may not get any Democrat votes. Now, we also may get three of four, but we may get no—for massive tax cuts. We're the highest taxed country in the world, and yet we may get no Democrat support. And that's because they're obstructionists, and they just basically want us to do badly, but that's not going to happen.
Yes, go ahead.
Office of National Drug Control Policy Director-Designate Thomas A. Marino/Opioid Crisis 
Q. On the opioid crisis, I listened to you on the campaign trail talk about that repeatedly.
The President. Right.
Q. You said you watched the ""60 Minutes"" report last night.
The President. Yes.
Q. Number one, do you want to reverse the law that Congressman Marino helped pass that DEA whistleblowers say has contributed to the expansion of the opioid crisis?
The President. We're going to look at that very closely.
Q. And does his sponsorship of that law in any way undermine your confidence in him as drug czar?
The President. Well, he's a good man. I have not spoken to him, but I will speak to him, and I'll make that determination. And if I think it's——
Q. Do you have——
The President. I think—if I think it's 1 percent negative to doing what we want to do, I will make a change, yes.
Q. Mr. McConnell——
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Wait, one second. Yes.
Opioid Crisis 
Q. What about declaring a written national emergency for this crisis? You've talked about it, but you haven't put that piece of paper together.
The President. We are going to be doing that next week. By the way, you know that's a big step. By the way, people have no understanding of what you just said. That is a very, very big statement. It's a very important step. And to get to that step, a lot of work has to be done, and it's time-consuming work. We're going to be doing it next week, okay?
Q. Did you have a chance, during your lunch today, to discuss the comments that Steve Bannon made this weekend? And what do you make of those comments, declaring war on the Republican Party, declaring war on you?
Leader McConnell. Look, you know, the goal here is to win elections in November. Back in 2010 and 2012, we nominated several candidates: Christine O'Donnell, Sharron Angle, Todd Akin, Richard Mourdock. They're not in the Senate. And the reason for that was that they were not able to appeal to a broader electorate in the general election. My goal as the leader of the Republican Party in the Senate is to keep us in the majority. The way you do that is not complicated. You have to have nominate people who can actually win, because winners make policy and losers go home. We changed the business model in 2014; we nominated people who could win everywhere. We took the majority in the Senate. We had one skirmish in 2016; we kept the majority in the Senate. So our operating approach will be to support our incumbents and, in open seats, to seek to help nominate people who can actually win in November. That's my approach, and that's the way you keep a governing majority.
Health Care Reform/Prescription Drug Costs 
Q. Mr. President, earlier today you criticized drug companies and also insurance companies, saying that drug companies were charging prices that are too high——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——and insurance companies were taking Government money——
The President. Exactly right.
Q. What specifically would you like to see both of those types of companies do?
The President. So the insurance companies have made a fortune with Obamacare, an absolute fortune. As you know, what I did with the cuts at the end, which were all going—you know, you're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars a month going right into the pockets of the insurance companies. And I'm very happy with what I did.
And because of that, people are talking now. Democrats are talking to the Republicans for a short-term taking care of, what we will call, health care so that people can have good health care without big spikes. You would have had massive spikes—you already have. I mean, every year the massive spikes to Obamacare have been ridiculous.
As far as—and I didn't speak to Mitch about this today, but a priority of mine—and you know that this is coming up—will be the cost of prescription drugs. We are going to get the costs way down, way down, and those drugs companies—so you have the insurance companies, in the one case; in the other case—actually, with regard to both, you have the drug companies.
They contribute massive amounts of money to political people. I don't know, Mitch, maybe even to you. [Laughter] But I have to tell you, they contribute massive amounts of money. Me, I'm not interested in their money. I don't need their money. I will tell you, you have prescription drugs—you go to England, you go to various places, Canada—you go to many, many countries, and the same exact pill from the same company, the same box, same everything, is a tiny fraction of what it costs in the United States.
We are going to get drug prices—prescription drug prices—way down, because the world has taken advantage of us. The world has taken advantage of us when that happens, so that's going to be very important.
Health Care Reform 
Q. Thank you. On health care, there are about 6 million people that get subsidies to help pay for Obamacare. About 70 percent, by one study, come from States that you won in November.
The President. Yes. Q. Now that you've cut off these payments, are you going to ensure that those people will still get help from the Federal Government to pay that insurance?
The President. Well, that's what we're looking to do, Joe [Jonathan Karl, ABC News]. We want to get it down so that people can have affordable health care. Look, you look at some States—116 percent up. In Alaska, over 200 percent up. In other States, 50 percent, 70 percent up, and those are some of the States that are doing better. Obamacare is a wreck, it's a mess, it's destroying lives. We want to get it in those States—the States that I did so well in—but also in States that I didn't win.
I want to get health care that's much more affordable and much better health care, and that's what we're doing.
Yes.
Tax Reform 
Q. Let me ask you about tax reform.
The President. Go ahead, tax reform.
Q. Yes, tax reform. You had said the other day that there were some adjustments being made.
The President. Yes.
Q. Gary Cohn said today that there would be some—some things that are negotiable.
The President. Sure.
Q. What exactly, in your eyes, is negotiable? And then, for the Leader, you said that the top priority is tax reduction—you did not say tax reform—in 2017, Leader McConnell. So can you commit specifically to tax reform in 2017? For the both of you.
The President. So we are doing minor adjustments. We want to make sure that the middle class is the biggest beneficiary of the tax cuts and tax reform. And that's, I'm sure, what Mitch meant also, because people get it confused.
We are doing massive tax cuts. We're also doing simplification and reform. Simplification, where, literally, if we can do it on page; now, in some cases, it may be two pages. But we're doing major simplification. We're bringing the categories down from—if you include zero, because there are zero—we're bringing it from eight to four. That's a big, big simplification, just that alone.
But we are doing a—the massive cuts. And I will say this: Wherever I've been, this has been so popular with the people. Now we have to get a couple of additional people to raise their hands.
Mitch.
Leader McConnell. Yes, I agree with the President, it's about both reduction and reform. It's been 30 years since this kind of effort was undertaken successfully, and we're going to succeed this time. The bills, the details of them, will be written by the Ways and Means and Finance Committees after we approve the budget. And obviously, the budget opens the path to tax reform. But it's a both—it's about both—about both reform and reduction. U.S. Servicemembers Killed in Niger/Presidential Communications With Families of Servicemembers Killed in Action 
Q. Why haven't we heard anything from you so far about the soldiers that were killed in Niger? And what do you have to say about that?
The President. I've written them personal letters. They've been sent, or they're going out tonight, but they were written during the weekend. I will, at some point during the period of time, call the parents and the families—because I have done that, traditionally. I felt very, very badly about that. I always feel badly. It's the toughest—the toughest calls I have to make are the calls where this happens, soldiers are killed. It's a very difficult thing. Now, it gets to a point where, you know, you make four or five of them in one day—it's a very, very tough day. For me, that's by far the toughest.
So, the traditional way—if you look at President Obama and other Presidents, most of them didn't make calls, a lot of them didn't make calls. I like to call when it's appropriate, when I think I'm able to do it. They have made the ultimate sacrifice.
So, generally, I would say that I like to call. I'm going to be calling them. I want a little time to pass. I'm going to be calling them. I have—as you know, since I've been President, I have. But in addition, I actually wrote letters individually to the soldiers we're talking about, and they're going to be going out either today or tomorrow.
Yes.
U.S. Embassy Personnel in Cuba 
Q. General Kelly said on—just last week that you believe that Cuba could stop the attacks against Americans. Do you believe them, that Cuba is—do you believe Cuba is responsible?
The President. I do. I think Cuba knew about it, sure. I do believe Cuba is responsible. I do believe that. And it's a very unusual attack, as you know, but I do believe Cuba is responsible, yes.
Republican Senatorial Candidate Roy S. Moore of Alabama 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Roy Moore, down in Alabama, has said that he believes homosexuality should be illegal and that Muslims should be barred from serving in the U.S. Congress. What makes you comfortable with someone with those beliefs serving in the U.S. Senate? And the same question to you, Mr. Leader.
The President. Well, I'm going to be meeting with Roy sometime next week, and we're going to talk to him about a lot of different things. But I'll be meeting with him.
He ran a very strong race. The people of Alabama, who I like very much and they like me very much, but they like Roy. And we'll be talking to him, and I can report to you then. Okay?
Go ahead.
Judicial Confirmation Process 
Q. Mr. President, thank you. This is a question for you and for Leader McConnell following up on your comments on budgets. One of the issues outstanding right now is whether the Senate Judiciary Committee will keep the tradition of blue slips. I'm wondering what your position is, Mr. President, and what your position is, Leader McConnell, since, you know, this is the tradition that right now gives Democrats leverage over the appointments. Leader McConnell. I can give you my position. The blue slip, for those of you who are not familiar with it, is a custom determined by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. And Senator Grassley can give you his view of how he views it. I'll give you my view.
My view is that a blue slip on a circuit judge is simply a notification of how you're going to vote. To conclude otherwise would have left us in the following position at the beginning of this Senate. Forty-eight Democratic Senators would have been able to blackball 62 percent of the circuit judge nominees. That's simply not a tenable place to land in a Senate that now deals with judges on the—with a simple majority.
So my own personal view is that a blue slip on a circuit judge should simply be a notification of how you intend to vote.
The President. I mean, we can talk blue slips, but my attitude is, I just want really capable people going to the courts.
Peter [Peter Alexander, NBC News].
Senate Confirmation of the President's Nominees 
Q. Mr. President, in 2012, you tweeted that ""Obama's complaints about Republicans stopping his agenda are BS,"" in your words, ""since he had full control for 2 years."" You wrote, ""He can never take responsibility."" But today you've said about some of the challenges right now in Congress and in Washington, ""I'm not going to blame myself, I'll be honest. They're not getting the job done."" So what's different then than now?
The President. Well, let me just explain what's different. We have nominations pending right now, and we have 182 approved—if you look at this: the number that he had approved was 65 percent and 70 percent, and we have 39 percent. They're holding up every single nomination.
Q. How about your agenda broadly?
The President. Schumer and the group are holding up every single nomination. They are obstructing. They're doing—it's really what—I'm telling you, they're not good politicians, but they're very good at obstruction.
They are holding up every single nomination, and I will tell you, Peter, it's not right. It's really not right. They'll bring them right out to the end, that last minute. What they're doing is unfair.
So you look at even Bush, you look at Obama, you look at Clinton, and you look at Bush original, you have 389 versus 182—these are approvals. You look at Clinton, 357 versus 182. You look at President Obama, 364 versus 182. These are nominations approved, and what they're doing to us—we have unbelievable people, and they're waiting to be approved. They've been waiting for a long period of time.
Now, I do believe that Mitch is going to start pushing them very hard, and he can do that, and he wants to do that. He also wants to get the judicial nominations through, and he wants to get them through fast too.
Go ahead, John [John Roberts, Fox News]. Okay. Go ahead, John.
The President's Relations With Democratic Congressional Leaders/Bipartisanship/The President's Legislative Agenda Q. Can I just follow on that, if I could, please? You seemed to have a budding spirit of cooperation with the Senate Minority Leader and the House Minority Leader when it came to the budget, when it came to this idea of finding a fix for DACA. But every proposal that you have floated since then, they have very critically rejected.
The President. It's true.
Q. So where is this relationship?
The President. Well, I hope to have a relationship. If we don't, we don't. I mean, we have races coming up in, as you know, in a year from now. I think we're going to probably do very well. I can say this: If we get taxes approved, we're going to do unbelievably well.
Many of the Senators are running in States that I won by massive amounts—20, over 20 percent, sometimes 30 percent; I guess in one or two cases, by over 40 percent over the Democrat.
Q. But do you think you can work with them?
The President. Well, we're going to let you know that at—I would like to give you that answer in about 7 years from now, is that okay? Meaning, one plus seven.
I hope to—John, I hope to be able to because I like the concept of bipartisan. But right now they are doing nothing but obstructing. And really, if you think about it, they're against major tax cuts that's going to make our country stronger and more competitive. That's a hard thing to win an election on, and I believe that some Democrats will be voting for us when it comes to the tax cuts.
Economic Development Legislation 
Q. What about this economic development bill that you mentioned, can you give us any of the details of what your plans are?
The President. I'm going to be proposing an economic development bill in the not-too-distant future. I want to get tax cuts, obviously, done first; maybe even the health care. But I think somewhere in between or shortly thereafter, I'm going to be developing an economic development bill that will put us so far ahead of other countries you will not even believe it. That will be very important.
Former President Barack Obama/Health Care Reform/Iran/National Economy/Immigration 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Last week, your administration made two major announcements on rolling back the Iran deal and getting rid of the cost-sharing reductions as part of Obamacare. And a lot of criticism has been leveled at your administration saying that, really, all you're doing is——
The President. And a lot of praise.
Q. Fair enough, sir. Rolling back—a lot of what you're doing is simply rolling back everything your predecessor accomplished. Is there a single policy of your predecessor that you specifically do not want to touch, sir?
The President. Well, we're very opposite in terms of incentives and incentives for jobs and other things. And if you look at what's happened, we just hit a new—a new high today again in the stock market. We've picked up, Mitch, it's as of this moment, $5.2 trillion in stock market value. We have the lowest unemployment rate in—I believe it's almost 17 years. We're doing well.
We're going to be doing immigration work that's going to be outstanding, and we're going to have people coming into our country based, hopefully, on a merit system, not just coming in randomly. But they're going to be coming in based on a merit system where they can help us. Because I have companies moving into this country—you saw what happened wit","h the automobile industry last week with five major plants. We have companies pouring back into this country for the first time in anybody's memory. We are actually going to be, fairly soon, at a point where we're going to need workers. Our country is going to do so well. But the tax cuts are going to be a major, major part of it.
Q. Sir, is there a policy you'd want to keep in place though? Is there a single policy you'd keep in place?
The President. Well, not too many, I must say. It's the opposite side of the spectrum.
Q. Sir, if I could follow-up on Iraq.
The President. All right, Peter [Peter Alexander, NBC News]. Go ahead, Peter.
Presidential Communications With Families of Servicemembers Killed in Action 
Q. Just a quick question: Earlier, you said that President Obama never called the families of fallen soldiers. How can you make that claim?
The President. I don't know if he did. No, no, no.
Q. Well, in fact——
The President. I was told that he didn't often. And a lot of Presidents don't; they write letters. I do——
Q. Is that based on—[inaudible]?
The President. Excuse me, Peter. I do a combination of both. Sometimes—it's a very difficult thing to do, but I do a combination of both. President Obama, I think, probably did sometimes, and maybe sometimes, he didn't. I don't know. That's what I was told. All I can do—all I can do is ask my generals. Other Presidents did not call. They'd write letters. And some Presidents didn't do anything.
Q. But why didn't——
The President. But I like the combination of—I like, when I can, the combination of a call and also a letter.
[At this point, many reporters began asking questions at once.]
All right, one at a time. Go ahead.
Investigation Into Russian Interference in 2016 Presidential Election 
Q. Thank you. If it would help you—if it would help Special Counsel Robert Mueller get to the end of the Russia investigation——
The President. Well, I'd like to see it end. Look, the whole Russian thing was an excuse—— Q. Would you agree to an interview with the Special Counsel or the legal team who is advising him?
The President. Excuse me, excuse me. The whole Russia thing was an excuse for the Democrats losing the election, and it turns out to be just one excuse. I mean, today Hillary blamed Nigel Farage. That one came out of nowhere. So that was just an excuse for the Democrats losing an election that, frankly, they have a big advantage in the electoral college. They should always be able to win in the electoral college, but they were unable to do it.
So there has been absolutely no collusion. It's been stated that they have no collusion. They ought to get to the end of it, because I think the American public is sick of it.
Go ahead.
Q. [Inaudible]—interview.
The President. Go ahead.
Q. Mr. President, Ronica Cleary with Fox 5.
The President. Yes.
Sergeant Beau R. Bergdahl, USA 
Q. Do you believe that your comments in any way affected Bowe Bergdahl's ability to receive a fair trial? And can you respond to his attorney's claims that——
The President. Well, I can't comment on Bowe Bergdahl because he's—as you know, they're—I guess he's doing something today, as we know. And he's also—they're setting up sentencing, so I'm not going to comment on him. But I think people have heard my comments in the past.
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Immigration Reform 
Q. Will you extend the deadline for DACA recipients if Congress can't pass the bill by March? Leader McConnell——
The President. Well, they should be able to do something. But we need very stronger border security, and we do want the wall.
Go ahead.
California Wildfires 
Q. My question is about the fires in Northern California. They feel like they've been left down——
The President. No, they haven't. In fact, I spoke to Governor Brown. We had a great conversation. We have FEMA there. And as you know, James Lee Witt gave us an A-plus, and I think if he didn't include the fires, he would include the fires also. We have FEMA there. We have military there. We have first responders there. It's a tragic situation. But we're working very closely with the representatives from California, and we're doing a good job.
Go ahead, back. Yes, go ahead, back.
Sexual Harassment Allegations Against the President Q. Mr. President, in the wake of an avalanche of allegations made against Harvey Weinstein, your campaign is being subpoenaed for any documents relating to sexual harassment allegations made against you. Do you have any response to that?
The President. All I can say is it's totally fake news. It's just fake. It's fake. It's made-up stuff, and it's disgraceful what happens. But that's happens in the world of politics.
Jon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News].
Immigration Reform 
Q. Mr. President, on the wall, are you going to insist that you must have wall funding before you can sign something for the DREAMers or for spending for the rest of the year?
The President. Our country needs a wall. Mexico, you see what's happening there. You see what just happened yesterday with one of their big political leaders. Mexico is not doing particularly well when it comes to the kind of thing that we have great interest in. Drugs are pouring across our border. We're stopping it, but we need a wall to really stop it. We need a wall in this country. You know it. I know it. Everybody knows it. We have to have a wall, so that's going to be part of it.
Q. [Inaudible]—North Korea, Mr. President.
Q. Sir, just to a quick follow-up on—[inaudible].
Q. Can somebody else get a——
Hurricane Maria Recovery Efforts in Puerto Rico 
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. Well, the Puerto Rico situation is so—because as you know——
Q. Do you maintain that the Federal response has been outstanding?
The President. Oh, I think—well, that's according to the Clinton administration's head of FEMA, it's been outstanding.
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. Puerto Rico is very tough because of the fact it's an island. But it's also tough because, as you know, it was in very poor shape before the hurricanes ever hit. Their electrical grid was destroyed before the hurricanes got there. It was in very bad shape, was not working, was in bankruptcy, owed $9 billion. And then, on top of that, the hurricane came.
Now, you're going to have to build a whole new electrical plant system. We're not talking about generators. We moved—Puerto Rico now has more generators, I believe, than any place in the world. There are generators all over the place. The fact is, their electrical system was in horrible shape before and even worse shape after.
So we are working right now—as you know, relief funds were just approved and are in the process of being approved by Congress. And that includes Texas, by the way. That includes Florida. And it also includes Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, et cetera. But it was in really bad shape before. We have done—I will say this, we have done——
Q. But scores of people don't have drinking water, Mr. President. People don't have drinking water. The President. We have—well, we've delivered tremendous amounts of water. Then what you have to do is you have to have distribution of the water by the people on the island. So we have massive amounts of water. We have massive amounts of food. But they have to distribute the food, and they have to do this. They have to distribute the food to the people on the island. So what we've done is, we now actually having military distributing food, something that really they shouldn't have to be doing.
But if you look at the Governor, who is a good man, by the way, but if you look at the Governor of Puerto Rico, he himself has said we've done an outstanding job. And most people have said we've done an outstanding job. But Puerto Rico is a very tough one.
Yes, go ahead.
Q. [Inaudible]—North Korea——
Abortion 
Q. [Inaudible]—support for the 20-week abortion ban bill. How important is this bill to you? And what are you doing to work with Leader McConnell to make sure it gets through the Senate?
The President. Well, I'll let Mitch. You want to talk about that, Mitch?
Leader McConnell. Was the question about the 20-week——
Q. [Inaudible]—abortion bill——
Leader McConnell. Yes, well, it's supported by virtually all of my members, and we expect to have a vote on it at some point.
The President. Go ahead.
The President's Upcoming Travel to Asia 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Previous Presidents who have traveled to South Korea have gone to the demilitarized zone. There are those who believe this would be the worst time to do that because it would be viewed as provocative. How do you view what you're trying to accomplish in South Korea? Do you intend to go to the DMZ?
The President. Well, I'll be going, as you know, to South Korea, to China, to Japan, to Vietnam for the summit. We have a big economic summit there. I may be going to the Philippines also. We've been invited. We've been invited to the Philippines, so I may be going to the Philippines. And I look forward to all of them. We haven't set the details as of this moment.
The President's Upcoming Travel to South Korea 
Q. Are you afraid of provoking North Korea by going to the DMZ?
The President. We'll take a look at that. I didn't hear in terms of provoking, but we will certainly take a look at that.
Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III/Iraq 
Q. Thank you, sir. A quick follow-up on an earlier question—[inaudible]—you discussed the Special Counsel and the investigation currently. Are you considering firing Robert Mueller? The President. No, not at all.
Q. One quick follow-up on Iraq, sir. On Iraq, the Kurdish forces and Iraqi forces last night were clashing in northern Iraq. Are you concerned about a larger conflict in the region while U.S. forces are still advising on the ground?
The President. We don't like the fact that they're clashing. We're not taking sides, but we don't like the fact that they're clashing.
Q. Do you support the Kurdish referendum for independence?
The President. We—well, let me tell you, we've had for many years a very good relationship with the Kurds, as you know. And we've also been on the side of Iraq, even though we should have never been in there in the first place. We should never have been there. But we're not taking sides in that battle.

2016 Democratic Presidential Nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton/National Football League National Anthem Controversy 
Q. Mr. President, in an interview earlier today, Hillary Clinton said that she did not believe that players taking a knee in the NFL was about disrespecting the flag, at complete odds with the way that you have referred to this. You fired back in a tweet saying that you hope that she runs again in 2020. Why——
The President. Oh, I hope Hillary runs. Is she going to run? I hope. Hillary, please run again.
Go ahead. [Laughter]
Q. So she's at odds with you over whether or not this is disrespecting the flag. Is she right, or is she wrong?
The President. I think she's wrong. Look, when they take a knee—there's plenty of time to do knees, and there's plenty of time to do lots of other things.
Q. She says taking a knee is reference to——
The President. But when you take a knee—well, that's why she lost the election. I mean, honestly, it's that thinking, that is the reason she lost the election. When you go down and take a knee or any other way, you're sitting essentially for our great national anthem, you're disrespecting our flag and you're disrespecting our country. And the NFL should have suspended some of these players for one game—not fire them—suspended them for one game. And then, if they did it again, it could have been two games and three games and then for the season. You wouldn't have people disrespecting our country right now.
Q. But what about——
The President. And if Hillary Clinton actually made the statement that, in a form, sitting down during the playing of our great national anthem is not disrespectful, then I fully understand why she didn't win. I know—I mean look, there are a lot of reasons that she didn't win, including the fact that she was not good at what she did.
Q. Sir——
The President. But I will tell you that is something that I had just heard about. Q. Sir——
The President. And I think that her statement in itself is very disrespectful to our country.
Thank you very much.
National Football League National Anthem Controversy 
Q. What about police-involving shootings? Sir, what about police-involving shootings?
The President. Thank you very much.
Q. Sir, what about police-involved shootings as it relates to the NFL? That is what the players are saying is the crux of why they're taking the knee, sir. The police-involved shooting issue, what would you do about that?
The President. It is very disrespectful to our country when they take a knee during our national anthem. It is very——
Q. What about the police-involved—what about that issue, sir?
The President. Just hear it, hear it. It is very disrespectful to our country when they take a knee during the national anthem, number one. Number two, the people of our country are very angry at the NFL. All you have to do is look at their ratings and look at their stadiums. You see empty seats where you never saw them before. A lot of people are very angry at it. It is highly disrespectful. They shouldn't do it.
Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.
Health Care Reform 
Q. Mr. President, is health care now Trumpcare?
The President. I don't think so."

Trump, The President's News Conference with Prime Minister Stefan Lofven of Sweden Online by Gerhard Peters and John T.

Thank you. I'm honored to be joined by Prime Minister Lofven of Sweden at our first meeting in the White House.
Sweden is one of our oldest and closest partners, and was among the first European nations to offer the United States an unsolicited treaty of friendship -- a treaty signed, believe it or not, in 1783. That's a long time ago.
My daughter, Ivanka, had a wonderful time watching American and Swedish athletes compete in the recent Men's Curling Final at the Olympics. (Laughter.)
PRIME MINISTER LOFVEN: (Inaudible.)
PRESIDENT TRUMP: That was something, huh? That was a little upset. But that wasn't expected, but that's okay. We'll take it. Right? All of the athletes should be immensely proud of the great job they did.
The Prime Minister and I have just concluded a series of very productive meetings. The relationship between the United States and Sweden is one based on shared values, including respect for individual rights, the rule of law, and human dignity. These common principles are the foundation of our partnership. And we have had a great partnership for many years.
We look forward to exploring further opportunities to increase our security and our cooperation in every other way. And we encourage nations around the world to share responsibility for our common defense.
We appreciate Sweden's leadership on the United Nations Security Council, and look very much forward to working together in the coming months.
The United States is also grateful to Sweden for advocating for Americans detained in North Korea. I particularly want to thank the Swedish government for its assistance in securing the release of American college student Otto Warmbier last year. Terrible, tragic event. We continue to pray for Otto's parents, Fred and Cindy -- two terrific people -- over the tragic death of their son.
And we remain determined to achieve a denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. And there's been a lot of news on that today. Hopefully, it's positive. Hopefully, it will lead to a very positive result.
In economic matters, we are striving for a relationship grounded in fairness and reciprocity. The United States is one of the largest investors in Sweden, and the Swedish investments in the United States support over 200,000 American jobs.
Earlier this afternoon, I heard from several Swedish business executives -- some of the greatest in the world. Where are you, folks? Please. Some of the great executives in the world. People I've known for a long time and certainly know of. And they're investing tremendous amounts of money in the United States and supporting, also, vocational training for American workers. We are grateful for those investments, and we are committed to working with Sweden to pursue even greater economic cooperation.
We're also continuing to pursue bilateral agreements to advance mutual prosperity. I'm pleased that Sweden intends to procure the Patriot air and missile defense system -- finest in the world -- in a deal worth over $3 billion. This system will increase stability and security in the Baltic Sea region.
A strong and balanced economic relationship strengthens security and prosperity in both of our countries. And this is just the beginning. We have a lot of things that we're working on. And we're working on them, really, very hard.
Mr. Prime Minister, I want to thank you again for joining us. And I want to thank your great staff, who we've met with, and your great business leaders. It was a very interesting and productive meeting.
The longstanding friendship between our people, anchored in our shared beliefs and values, has greatly enriched both of our countries. And this is just the beginning. Our relationship has never been better. An honor to have you here. Thank you. Thank you very much.
PRIME MINISTER LOFVEN: Thank you, Mr. President, for a warm and generous welcome. It is a true pleasure to be here at the White House. This year, Sweden and the United States celebrate 200 years of diplomatic relations, and this meeting reaffirms the strength of our relations.
History has shown that our two nations share fundamental values and interests, such as democracy and human rights. We also share a strong partnership that continues to evolve.
Today, we have discussed how to further strengthen our country's prosperity and security. As for prosperity, Sweden is one of the largest per capita investors in the United States, and my country may not be big, but we support, directly and indirectly, almost 1 million jobs in the United States. And some key executives of the companies that provide these jobs are also here with me at this visit.
At the same time, the United States is our most important foreign employer, and many U.S. companies play a vital role in providing investment and creating jobs in Sweden. President Trump and I have discussed how our nations can support jobs and growth. It's a crucial issue.
For Sweden, that means embracing new sustainable technologies which permit our economy to grow, but at the same time reducing emissions, and also how we can secure good jobs in a labor market constantly changing due to automation and digitalization.
Sweden and the United States are two of the most innovative economies in the world, and we see great opportunities ahead. Swedish prosperity is built on cooperation, competitiveness, and free trade, and I am convinced that increased tariffs will hurt us all in the long run. And as a Swede, I, of course, support the efforts of the European Union to achieve trade with fewer obstacles and as few as possible.
Turning to security, the President and I have discussed some key regional and global security challenges, such as the situation on the Korean Peninsula, but also the developments in Sweden's neighborhood.
We have also addressed the constructive cooperation between Sweden and the United States in the United Nations Security Council.
I would like to underline that the transatlantic link is strong, and it remains crucial to responding to global security challenges. Sweden is a military non-aligned country, but we build security in partnership with others, and we greatly value our broad security and defense cooperation with the United States.
One important example of that is our joint efforts to fight and combat terrorism. Sweden and the United States stand shoulder to shoulder in the global coalition against ISIS and also in the resolute support mission in Afghanistan. And these vital military efforts must go hand in hand with strong political, diplomatic, and also civilian support to create sustainable results.
So, in conclusion, as we celebrate 200 years of diplomatic relations, we're also planning for shared prosperity and security for many, many years to come. And once again, I thank you, Mr. President, for a constructive and successful meeting, and for the very warm welcome that both my delegation and I received. Thank you so much.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much.
John.
Q: Thank you, Mr. President. You spoke about North Korea in the Oval Office, so I'd like to turn to trade, if I could. My understanding is that the Prime Minister came to you with a message from the European Union Commission President saying, if you put tariffs on steel and aluminum, we'll slap you back with punitive tariffs on bourbon and jeans and the motorcycles that you talk about from Wisconsin. Are you still planning on going ahead with these tariffs? There are some people in your party who have suggested it's not a good idea.
And, Prime Minister Lofven, what's your perspective on tariffs? And what message did you convey to the President from Sweden and from the European Union? Thank you.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, the United States has been taken advantage of by other countries, both friendly and not so friendly, for many, many decades. And we have a trade deficit of $800 billion a year, and that's not going to happen with me. We have been mistreated by many, sometimes fairly, but there are, really, very few instances where that's taken place.
And I don't blame the countries. I blame our leadership for allowing it to happen. When I was with President Xi in China -- as an example, we lose $500 billion a year on trade. We have a deficit of approximately $500 billion a year with China. And we're doing things with China which are very strong, but they understand it. But I was with him and I said to him in public, I said, ""Look, I'm not blaming you. I blame our people for not doing a better job, for allowing this to happen.""
But it's like that with many countries, other than small -- the European Union has been particularly tough on the United States. They make it almost impossible for us to do business with them, and yet they send their cars and everything else back into the United States. And they can do whatever they'd like, but if they do that, then we put a big tax of 25 percent on their cars. And believe me, they won't be doing it very long. The European Union has not treated us well, and it's been a very, very unfair trade situation.
I'm here to protect. And one of the reasons I was elected is I'm protecting our workers, I'm protecting our companies. And I'm not going to let that happen.
So we're doing tariffs on steel. We cannot lose our steel industry. It's a fraction of what it once was. And we can't lose our aluminum industry. Also a fraction of what it once was.
And our country is doing well. The massive tax cuts and all of the deregulation has really kicked us into gear. But I have to work on trade deals. We're working on NAFTA right now. And if we're able to make a deal with Canada and Mexico in NAFTA, then there will be no reason to do the tariffs with Canada and Mexico.
But again, other countries we won't have that choice, unless they can do something for us. As an example, if the European Union takes off some of the horrible barriers that make it impossible for our product to go into there, then we can start talking. Otherwise, we're going to leave it the way it is.
So the fact is we've been mistreated as a country for many years, and it's just not going to happen any longer.
Q: How do you avoid this escalating -- how do you avoid this escalating into a trade war?
PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, we'll have to see. You know, when we're behind on every single country, trade wars aren't so bad. You understand what I mean by that? When we're down by $30 billion, $40 billion, $60 billion, $100 billion, the trade war hurts them; it doesn't hurt us. So we'll see what happens.
You know, you can also take it -- in some cases, we lose on trade, plus we give them military where we're subsidizing them tremendously. So not only do we lose on trade, we lose on military, and hence we have these massive deficit numbers in our country. We're going to straighten it out. And we'll do it in a very loving way. It will be a loving, loving way. They'll like us better and they will respect us much more. Because even they say -- right now, they say, ""We can't believe we've gotten away."" I mean, two countries have said, ""We cannot believe, to be honest with you, we've gotten away with this so long."" Now, one of them made that statement before I got elected. He said, ""I can't believe I made that statement before I got elected."" But it's one of those things.
We have to straighten it out. We really have no choice.
Q: And, Mr. Prime Minister, how forceful was your message to the President on what the consequences will be if he goes ahead with tariffs?
PRIME MINISTER LOFVEN: First, trade is a European Union mandate, so we're a member of the European Union. It's a European mandate to handle the trade issues. But as a member of the European Union, I think it's important for us to try to find a way to cooperate between the European Union and the United States.
I fully understand and respect the President's view that they have to look after his own country -- the country that you're leading. I under that fully. That's my primary task, as well.
But for me, leading a small country, depending on open trade, the best way for us is to do that with others, because our export equals to 50 percent of our GDP. So for us, it is crucially important that we have this open and free trade.
Today, also, I believe that the supply chains are very, very complicated to see. I know that, for example, when we sell our fighter aircraft, which is a very good aircraft, the content is perhaps 50 percent American. So we want this to be resolved in cooperation. And when it comes to steel, yes, we have an overcapacity in the world. That's obvious. But at the same time, it is China that is producing about 50 percent of the steel in the world, and European Union perhaps 10 percent and less than that.
So, to summarize, I think it was a pity. Again, it's a European Union mandate. But it was a pity, also, that the T-TIP negotiations ended, because perhaps with negotiations and talks, we can come into a situation where the European Union and the United States can cooperate. I think that would be a very good solution.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: Just to add maybe a little bit further: If you talk China, I've watched where the reporters have been writing, 2 percent of our steel comes from China. Well, that's not right. They transship all through other countries. And you'll see that a country that doesn't even have a steel mill is sending us 3 percent steel for our country. And many countries are doing it, but it comes from China.
So China doesn't send us 2 percent; they send us a much, much higher level than that. But it's called transshipping. So it doesn't look good when it all comes out of China, so they send it through other countries, and it comes to us. And it's putting our steel mills out of business. Our aluminum mills are going out of business. And we need steel and we need aluminum.
And you know there's a theory that if a country doesn't have steel, it doesn't have a country. And it's true. So this is more than just pure economics. This is about defense. This is about the country itself.
But again, remember this: We lose $800 billion a year in trade. And I think I was elected, at least partially, on this issue. And I've been saying it for 25 years -- our country has been taken advantage of by everybody. By everybody. Almost everybody. And we cannot let that happen any longer, not for our companies and not, most importantly, for our workers. So we're not going to let it happen.
Please.
PRIME MINISTER LOFVEN: Okay. Tina, TT News Agency.
Q: So, Mr. President, thank you for hosting us. You mentioned that Sweden has helped the United States with North Korea. How do you see your collaboration in the future to create a future of a peaceful Korean Peninsula? How do you see Sweden's role there? How do you both view the collaboration?
And as a follow-up to that, if I may -- Mr. President, I know that you follow the development in Sweden closely, especially when it comes to immigration politics. Now that you've spent some time with our Prime Minister, how do you view Sweden in general? What is your take? And also, on our immigration politics? Thank you.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: I think you have a wonderful Prime Minister, I have to say. We've gotten to know each other. Certainly, you have a problem with the immigration. It's caused problems in Sweden. I was one of the first ones to say it. I took a little heat, but that was okay because I proved to be right. But you do have a problem, and I know the problem will slowly disappear -- hopefully, rapidly disappear.
But as far as our relationship with Sweden, it's going to be only stronger, only better, both in a military sense and a trading sense, and economic sense. You know, Sweden is, I think, the largest -- the eighth largest investor in the United States. And they like me very much because the market is up almost 40 percent since Election Day. So I've made a lot of these business geniuses look even better. So they like Trump. But, you know, it's been up very substantially.
But I believe Sweden is about the eighth largest investor in the United States, and that's quite an achievement.
Q: What about the collaboration on North Korea?
PRESIDENT TRUMP: We've been working on North Korea. Sweden has somewhat of a relationship with North Korea. We've been working with North Korea. As I said, Otto was really brought home, unfortunately in very poor condition, but Otto was brought home largely with the help of Sweden. They're terrific -- terrific people. People from Sweden, the Swedish people, are fantastic people. I have many friends in New York and Washington from Sweden, and they are fantastic people.
Thank you.
Q: And, Mr. Prime Minister, how do you view Sweden and North Korea and the U.S.?
PRIME MINISTER LOFVEN: We have to find a dialogue. I know it's not easy, but that's the way it has to be. It's a very dangerous situation, and we need all to be very concerned about the development of nuclear weapons.
But we must look at the Peninsula, the region, the world, and this has to do with world peace or something else. So the key actors is obviously the two countries, South and North Korea, as well as the United States and other big countries. They're the key actors.
We've said that we can provide -- we can be a channel or do whatever we can to see that the dialogue is smooth. Not being naïve. It's not up to us to solve this problem, but we can definitely, with our long presence on the Peninsula -- both in South and North. We have an embassy in Pyongyang, for example. We've had that since 1973.
So with that relation with North Korea, I believe that they trust us. We are a non-aligning country, and -- on military, non-aligning country. And I think if we can -- if the President decides, the key actors decide if they want us to help out, we'll be there.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: They really have been terrific. Really terrific.
Saagar Enjeti, Daily Caller. Please, Saagar.
Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Since it's my first time before you, I thought you might indulge me with two questions. First, sir, do you believe that North Korea's recent willingness to talk is sincere, or is it an effort to buy time for their nuclear program? And to what do you owe this recent openness to talk?
PRESIDENT TRUMP: Me. No, I think that -- (laughter). Nobody got that. (Laughter.) I think that they are sincere, but I think they're sincere also because the sanctions and what we're doing with respect to North Korea, including, you know, the great help that we've been given from China. And they can do more, but I think they've done more than, certainly, they've ever done for our country before. So China has been a big help. I think that's been a factor.
But the sanctions have been very, very strong and very biting. And we don't want that to happen. So I really believe they are sincere. I hope they're sincere. We're going to soon find out.
Q: Sir, you tweeted today that you would like to see some change in the people around you. Does that include your Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, or either of your Cabinet secretaries?
PRESIDENT TRUMP: No, I don't really talk about that. I just said that the White House has tremendous energy. It has tremendous spirit. It is a great place to be working.
Many, many people want every single job. You know, I read where, ""Oh, gee, maybe people don't want to work for Trump."" And believe me, everybody wants to work in the White House. They all want a piece of that Oval Office; they want a piece of the West Wing. And not only in terms of it looks great on their résumé; it's just a great place to work.
It's got tremendous energy. It's tough. I like conflict. I like having two people with different points of view, and I certainly have that. And then I make a decision. But I like watching it, I like seeing it, and I think it's the best way to go. I like different points of view.
But the White House has a tremendous energy, and we have tremendous talent. Yeah, there will be people -- I'm not going to be specific -- but there will be people that change. They always change. Sometimes they want to go out and do something else. But they all want to be in the White House. So many people want to come in. I have a choice of anybody. I could take any position in the White House, and I'll have a choice of the 10 top people having to do with that position. Everybody wants to be there.
And they love this White House because we have energy like rarely before. Okay? Thank you very much.
Q: Thank you, sir.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: Please.
Q: Mr. Prime Minister, last year you criticized the President for drawing a link between immigrant crime and the recent arrivals of refugees. This week, one of our own flagship papers, The New York Times, actually profiled a link between hand grenade violence and immigrant gangs in your country. Do you stand by your criticism of the President?
PRIME MINISTER LOFVEN: First, Sweden -- we have our share of domestic challenges, no doubt about that. And we inherited a legislation that was not sustainable legislation on migration, which meant that, in 2015, we received 163,000 refugees seeking refuge. Bear in mind, we're a country of 10 million inhabitants. So that was a lot. Seventy percent of them came from September to December, which meant it was a dramatic increase.
We changed the legislation, so now we have decreased the number of refugees entering Sweden, and we're also putting pressure on the other European Union countries to take their share of the responsibility. This is not a responsibility for one, two, three or four countries. It is a shared responsibility. We are working with that now, within the European Union.
And we, of course -- we also have problems with crime, organized crime, in Sweden -- shootings. But it's not like you have these no-go zones. We have dealt with it. I'm dealing with it every day, allocating more resources to the police, more policemen trained, more resources to the security police, tougher law on crime, tougher law on terrorism, supporting terrorism. So we do a lot to combat that.
And we can also see some results now in our three major cities -- decreased shootings -- because we're attacking the organized crime very tough. And we'll keep on doing that because there is no space in Sweden for organized crime because they decrease freedom for ordinary people.
At the same time, Sweden has a high growth. Unemployment is going down; employment is going up. We have high investment rates. We are allocating resources to the welfare. We have a strong, strong economy with a surplus -- huge surplus -- that we're now using to develop our society with, for example, the welfare that we want.
So the pictures we need to be -- it's two pictures. Yes, we have our share of domestic problems and challenges, no doubt about that. But we're dealing with them. And we also have a good foundation for dealing with them, not least with the strong economy and the shrinking unemployment.
Okay. So it's (inaudible), Swedish Radio.
Q: Thank you. This is an election year for both of our countries, and I want to ask you, Mr. Trump: What do you think Sweden should learn from how the Russian influence campaign affected the presidential election in the U.S.?
PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, the Russians had no impact on our votes whatsoever. But, certainly, there was meddling and probably there was meddling from other countries and maybe other individuals. And I think you have to be really watching very closely. You don't want your system of votes to be compromised in any way. And we won't allow that to happen.
We're doing a very, very deep study, and we're coming out with some, I think, very strong suggestions on the '18 election. I think we're going to do very well on the '18 election, although, historically, those in the White House have a little bit of a dip. But I think we're going to do well because the economy is so good and because we're protecting our job, like -- our jobs are being protected, finally, like with what we're doing with the tariffs.
But the big thing would be the tax cut and the regulations cuts. Also, the judges. I mean, we have outstanding judges. Judge Gorsuch in the Supreme Court, and many, many judges going onto the bench all over the country.
So I think we're going to do very well, and I think it will be a tremendous surprise to people how well. The economy is so good; jobs are so good. Black unemployment, Hispanic unemployment at all-time lows. I mean, we're really doing well.
So based on that, I guess we should do pretty well, and I hope so. But you have to be very vigilant. And one of the things we're learning is, it's always good -- it's old-fashioned, but it's always good to have a paper back-up system of voting. It's called ""paper,"" not highly complex computers -- paper. And a lot of states are doing that. They're going to a paper backup, and I think that's a great idea.
But we're studying it very closely. Various agencies, including Homeland Security, are studying it very carefully.
Q: But are you worried about Russia trying to meddle in the midterm election?
PRESIDENT TRUMP: No, because we'll counteract whatever they do. We'll counteract it very strongly. And we are having strong backup systems. And we've been working, actually -- we haven't been given credit for this, but we've actually been working very hard on the '18 election and the '20 election coming up. Thank you very much.
Q: Mr. Lofven, are you guys on the same page when it comes to evaluating the threat from Russia when it comes to meddling in elections, you think?
PRIME MINISTER LOFVEN: Well, we both agree upon that the election in a country should -- the result of the election in a country should be decided by nobody else but the voters in that country. And that is also our clear stance.
And that is why our intelligence agencies now also increase in their own capacity to detect and counter, whether it's hacker attacks or financing, or producing or spreading propaganda, whatever it is. We are increasing our capacity to handle that. We are cooperating with other European Union countries. Some of our agencies are also cooperating with American counterparts. And this we'll continue to do.
So any foreign power that believes that they can interfere with our election, we will find out and we will call them out very clearly, loud.
Q: And since this is the first time that you two meet, just the two of you, where did you find most common ground and where do you differ most on political issues?
PRIME MINISTER LOFVEN: (Laughs.) We -- First, we --
PRESIDENT TRUMP: Maybe almost everything?
PRIME MINISTER LOFVEN: (Laughs.) Yeah. We -- no, first, we -- I mean, we both come from outside politics, into politics. I've spent 30 years in industry as a welder but also as a trade unionist -- trade union leader -- spending 75, 80 percent of my time cooperating with the company leaders, with the employers' organization in an effort to strengthen our industry. So that's, perhaps, a similar background. Not similar -- because it's different -- but we come from outside politics.
But, of course, also, friends differ from time to time. The Paris Agreement, the importance of the Paris Agreement, we stand by that. We think it's very important that we implement and fulfill the Paris Agreement because of the climate issue. And on that, we might differ. Terrorists, as well.
But having said that, still we know that the relationship is a good -- yes, so we can take -- that we differ as well, because the values are there and we cooperate very, very good on economic issues, making sure that we create jobs and growth, and also on security issues, both when it comes to combatting terrorism but also when it comes to defend ourselves.
Q: Just finally, a follow-up for Mr. Trump. Do you think that trade is where Sweden and the U.S. differ most right now?
PRESIDENT TRUMP: Oh, I think we have very good relationships on trade. We have had, and we are constantly in touch. We have, on the military, great cooperation, including design of various components of aircraft, et cetera. And we are -- we were discussing that. We have some of the great makers of these components in the room with us today.
No, we have a very good relationship on trade, and we always will have. Sweden is a great country. It's small, but it's very sharp, I will tell you. They are very sharp.
Thank you very much, everybody. I appreciate it. Thank you."

Thank you. Today I'm honored to host the President of Estonia, the President of Latvia, and the President of Lithuania at the U.S.-Baltic Centennial Summit. Thank you all for traveling to the White House for these really important discussions. We've just spent a long time together, and it was very interesting.
This summit proudly displays to the world America's deep and lasting friendship with the Baltic nations. On behalf of the American people, thank you very much. And we are going to have another 100-year—a very long and beautiful relationship. This is your 100th year of independence. Congratulations.
For a century, the United States has stood with the people of the Baltics in support of their independence, sovereignty, and self-determination. Through the decades of brutal Soviet occupation, the United States never ceased to recognize the sovereignty of the Baltic republics. In our discussions today, I was proud to reaffirm America's commitment to the Welles Declaration of 1940 and the U.S.-Baltic Charter of 1998. These same principles lie at the heart of America's approach to world affairs, honoring the right of peaceful citizens and nations to protect their interests and chart their own wonderful destinies.
All three Baltic republics are committed NATO Allies. I want to express our gratitude to each of your countries for fulfilling your full obligations and meeting the 2-percent GDP benchmark for national defense this year. Your commitment to burden-sharing is an example, really, that other NATO nations and partners all around the world will have to all get together and bear. Some of them do not make the same commitment. Hopefully, they soon will. When nations are committed to peace and to security, they have to pay their share. And we will all enjoy a much more safe and prosperous future.
Baltic countries are also providing security assistance and training as part of the coalition to defeat ISIS. The coalition has liberated almost 100 percent of the territory once held by ISIS in Syria and in Iraq, and we will not rest until ISIS is gone.
In economic matters, our cooperation continues to develop and grow, as you well know. We're excited about several new opportunities for collaboration, especially in science, medicine, and technology. Immediately following this summit, the Department of Commerce and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce will host a U.S.-Baltic Business Summit to expand mutual trade and investment between our nations. And they're all looking forward to seeing you.
The Baltic countries remain a key market for U.S. aircraft, automobiles, machinery, and medical equipment. And we welcome increased bilateral trade with all three nations based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity.
Finally, we are enhancing our cooperation on energy security. We're all collaborating to diversify energy sources, supplies, and routes throughout the Baltic region, including expanding exports of U.S. liquefied natural gas, of which you've become a bigger and bigger user. These are just some of the many wonderful opportunities we can seize together. To all three Baltic leaders with us today, thank you again for helping to celebrate. And this is really a very great celebration because it's a historic milestone. Our friendship will continue to grow closer, and our cooperation will continue to bring about the greater security and prosperity for our citizens. And you have done terrific jobs as leaders, as Presidents of your countries. And we tell you that, for your citizens, we are there for you.
As we begin the next 100 years of our partnership, the Baltic republics can trust the United States will remain a strong, proud, and loyal friend and ally.
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Please.
President Grybauskaite. Probably, it's my turn?
President Trump. Yes. Whatever you like.
President Grybauskaite. It looks so.
President Trump. Ladies first.
President Grybauskaite. [Laughter] So, of course, we're very thankful for the possibility to be here, especially, and not only, because of our anniversary in our region, but because of alliance which we are reaffirming today with United States by adopting the declaration, where we say that article 5 is ironclad for all of us and the collective defense issues are important to all of us.
And we understand how important NATO is for all of us and why we, during our discussions, talked so much about the reforming—further reforming—NATO, the investments into our defense, the amounts necessary to invest into our defense, and of course, together, where it is necessary, all of us. And Lithuania is with the United States on fighting the terrorists through all the world. We're back in Afghanistan. We're in Mali. We're in Central African Republic. We're in Kosovo. We're in Ukraine together. So we are partners, allies, and trustful allies.
And because of that, we are sure that the reforms of NATO, which we are investing together and preparing together, will be resultative as it was before, but especially now, because we are seeing United States leadership. We're seeing the willingness of United States to see different NATO, different quality of NATO.
And I can be, probably, open. We talked to the President. I will joke a little bit—joking about that we need leadership sometimes for decision-making, even unpredictable leadership, to make enough leverage and pressure for the rivals to believe that we can make a decision. And that's, we think, this kind of leadership in President Trump.
And this is good, because without the leverage and pressure, there will be no additional spendings in our defense, in NATO. There will be no additional decisions for rotating military forces of United States in our countries. There will be no willingness to look into the matter of air defense, which we need very much.
So from all this point of views, we trust that our partner and ally is investing seriously in the future of our defense, not only our regions, but the NATO's territorial defense and in the peace and security of the world as it was before. Of course, the businesses are coming together. Ally in military cooperation, in—goes with economic cooperation. And I am very happy that today, in our business forum, we will sign two agreements with two American companies on the liquid gas cooperation.
Lithuania has a liquid gas station and factory, so-called ""floating boat."" But we can be independent, all three Baltic States, on the gas supply because of that. And this gives us strength and possibility to make our own decisions, not to depend on one supplier. And American liquid gas will come on time and will make us more independent in our decision-making and diversifies our gas supply.
And this is about a real friendship, about real cooperation between our region and United States. And this comes also together with trade matters, where today we see some discussions on the welfare level between United States and European Union. We are together with the decisions that trade needs to be useful and equally fair to all sides. There is no sense to go to the war. But decisions—if there is disbalances, need to be find. And this we will support as ally of United States.
So, together with international obligations in military, together with the cooperation in economy, together with the United States and the European Union in solving the trade disputes and issues—we are standing with and together. And we hope that, as the President said, next hundred years will be even better, closer, together, and we will be able to achieve and make more.
Thank you.
President Trump. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Please.
President Vejonis. Your Excellency, President Trump, my esteemed Baltic colleagues, dear friends, the Baltic-U.S. President summits are a reaffirmed of our shared commitment to fundamental values, our long-lasting friendship, and the steadfast partnership that we have enjoyed for nearly a century.
The United States of America is our closest friend and ally. I appreciate that we have each other's mutual support in our endeavors as well as in the security challenges we are facing.
Today we reflected on our many achievements and set a course for our future undertakings. We have agreed to enhance our defense and security cooperation. The Baltic States appreciate the United States commitment to deterrence policy in the Baltic region and the military assistance provided to our forces. We will continue to commit 2 percent of GDP towards the development of our military capabilities for the purposes of both strengthening NATO's posture in the eastern flank and contributing to international security.
The Baltic States and the United States acknowledged the need to continue the successful existing cooperation we have encountered in modern-day security threats such as terrorism, cyber and informational warfare, and nuclear proliferation.
Today all of us committed to placing greater emphasis on advancing our economic and trade and investment relationships. We recognize great potential in areas of innovation, modern technologies, and the digital economy. And we will explore possibilities for forging new partnerships to this end. I am particularly proud of successes of Latvian companies that have generated more than 2,000 jobs in the U.S.: in Georgia, in North Carolina, in California. It's—it just shows how important is this economic cooperation.
And finally, the Baltic States and the United States agreed to continue promoting closer people-to-people contacts, because these contacts are very important for every member of our society. And let me stress that President Trump was an outstanding host today. Thanks for hosting us in this—for us—in this very important event when we celebrate 100 years anniversary of our statehood.
Thanks.
President Trump. Thank you very much. Thank you.
President Kaljulaid. President Trump, my dear neighbors, dear journalists: I would like to thank President Trump and his administration for his political leadership in our region and for the very visible commitment, which has been demonstrated through a number of high-level visits, also, to our region.
This year, we do celebrate, indeed, our centennial anniversary. Of these 100 years, for 50, we were occupied by the Soviet Union. And people in our country got up every morning knowing that there are democratic countries, led by United States, who have never recognized the occupation of the Baltic States.
Our national flag—the blue, black, and white—was waving here in America throughout these years. It couldn't have been done at that time in Estonia. It was heartwarming. It was true sign of friendship. We knew it back then, and we remember it, and we are still grateful for it, will be forever.
Today we agree the declaration also reminding us about the foundations of our relations. My friends here spoke a lot about what we do. It's always worth to remind why we do this. We believe that peace, security, and prosperity depend on strong sovereign nations that respect their citizens at home and cooperate to promote peace abroad.
Our partnership is based on principles of democracy and individual liberty and the rule of law. These things are extremely important. Today we stand together, likeminded partners and allies. Yes, Baltic States are quite small, but they are important because of their location, but not only, because of what we do as contributing partners to the global security.
We find it very important to contribute in the counterterrorism fight. We find it important, since 2011, to spend 2 percent of our GDP on defense. We find it extremely important to remember that we stand together and we form something which we call in my office, ""an axis of good."" This is an axis of good. May it be—[inaudible]—for you all.
Yes, Estonia and the United States are very different by the size of their economy. But when we are speaking about digital economies, then this doesn't matter anymore. Estonia is one of the world leading nations of digital governance. And our companies are working with companies in your country to make sure that people elsewhere could benefit.
This cannot come without cybersecurity. There is a NATO Centre of Excellence on Cybersecurity in Estonia, because we have been attacked on cyber, long before anybody else. We still work together, we contribute, and we hope that we are really helpful to all of our partners.
Yes, we have also more conventional trade which we do together. People in Walmart going for their preordered packages in a couple of years will see them delivered by Estonian-made package delivery robots. We are proud of this.
And we're also proud of our legal environment in Estonia, which invites business to try and test new ideas in our place, which is tiny, and then upscale when it makes more sense to upscale. This way we work together both on defense matters, economic matters, and always stand on our common value base. This is the foundation of our relations.
Thank you for today for making this visible, this axis of good.
President Trump. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. We'll take a few questions. We're going to also have questions specifically for the Baltics.
Steve [Steve Holland]. Reuters.
Border Security/North Atlantic Treaty Organization/Syria 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Some of your military advisers are urging you to keep a contingent of U.S. troops in Syria to ensure the defeat of ISIS. What is your current thinking on this subject? Do you still want them out?
And secondly, could you clarify what you meant about having the U.S. military guard the U.S. border along with Mexico? Thank you, sir.
President Trump. Yes. First of all, the border. The Mexican border is very unprotected by our laws. We have horrible, horrible and very unsafe laws in the United States, and we're going to be able to do something about that, hopefully, soon. Hopefully, Congress will get their act together and get in and create some very powerful laws, like Mexico has and like Canada has and like almost all countries have.
We don't have laws. We have catch-and-release. You catch, and then you immediately release. And people come back years later for a court case, except they virtually never come back.
So we are preparing for the military to secure our border between Mexico and the United States. We have a meeting on it in a little while with General Mattis and everybody. And I think that it's something we have to do.
Now, the caravan—which is over a thousand people, coming in from Honduras—thought they were going to just walk right through Mexico and right through the border.
As you know, NAFTA is a phenomenal deal for Mexico. It's been a horrible deal for the United States. We're renegotiating it now. But it has been a horrible, horrible, embarrassing deal for the United States. This should have been terminated or renegotiated many years ago.
Mexico—we have a trade deficit with Mexico of over $100 billion a year. And I told Mexico yesterday that, because of the fact that their laws are so strong, they can do things about it that, hard to believe, the United States can't. I said, ""I hope you're going tell that caravan not to get up to the border."" And I think they're doing that, because as of 12 minutes ago, it was all being broken up. We'll see what happens. But we have to have strong borders. We need the wall. We've started building the wall. As you know, we have a billion-six [dollars]But we have to have strong borders. We need the wall. We've started building the wall. As you know, we have a billion-six [dollars]But we have to have strong borders. We need the wall. We've started building the wall. As you know, we have a billion-six [dollars]*.
As far as Syria is concerned, our primary mission, in terms of that, was getting rid of ISIS. We've almost completed that task, and we'll be making a decision very quickly, in coordination with others in the area, as to what we'll do. Saudi Arabia is very interested in our decision. And I said: ""Well, you know, you want us to stay? Maybe you're going to have to pay."" But a lot of people—you know, we do a lot of things in this country. We do them for—we do them for a lot of reasons, but it's very costly for our country, and it helps other countries a hell of a lot more than it helps us.
So we're going to be making a decision. We've had a tremendous military success against ISIS, as you know. It's close to a hundred percent, as I just said. And we'll be making a decision as to what we do in the very near future. We'll be consulting, also, with groups of our people and groups of our allies. Okay?
Syria/Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) Terrorist Organization 
Q. So you're inclined to pull the troops out?
President Trump. Say it?
Q. You're inclined to pull the troops out?
President Trump. I want to get out. I want to bring our troops back home. I want to start rebuilding our Nation. We will have, as of 3 months ago, $7 trillion in the Middle East over the last 17 years. We get nothing—nothing—out of it. Nothing. And as you remember in civilian life, for years I said, ""Keep the oil."" I was always saying, ""Keep the oil."" We didn't keep the oil. Who got the oil? It was ISIS got the oil, a lot of it. That's what funded their campaigns. They took a lot of the oil, and it was largely responsible for funding. We should have kept the oil then. We didn't keep the oil.
So I want to get back. I want to rebuild our Nation. Think of it: $7 trillion over a 17-year period; we have nothing—nothing—except death and destruction. It's a horrible thing. So it's time. It's time. We were very successful against ISIS. We'll be successful against anybody militarily. But sometimes, it's time to come back home, and we're thinking about that very seriously. Okay? Thank you.
Baltic States-U.S. Relations 
Q. Lithuanian Television. Mr. President, not about getting out, but getting in. The joint declaration mentions the periodic American deployments in the Baltic countries. What, specifically, can you commit to, having heard the requests and wishes of the Baltic States?
And, President, you have mentioned Russia as a terrorist state. Did you have a meeting of minds here as to the threat that Russia poses to the neighboring countries? Thank you.
President Trump. Well, we have a very strong relationship, as the Presidents will tell you, with the Baltic States. And we are with them. We're friends, and we're allies. And we are going to have a long-term, very fine relationship. In addition, we do business on trade. We work very hard on security together. Surprisingly, large numbers of trade. These are very industrious nations. Now, you're from there so you know exactly what I'm talking about. These are tremendous people, and very, very industrious. We do a lot of business on trade.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
President Grybauskaite. The second part of your question, of course, interesting, especially because we didn't talk in that ways about the rival, especially on our border. But then, a country behaves aggressively, performs wars, threatens, we have nuclear missiles on your border—of course, you sometimes call this country not very friendful. That's why we're investing into our defense, we're investing into our security, we're investing into reforming NATO, and we would like to see strong NATO, strong alliance. And that's what we are going to do together.
President Trump. Okay. Thank you. Would you like to choose somebody, President?
President Kaljulaid. Your turn. Your turn. Go ahead.
Foreign Investment in the Baltic States 
Q. Mr. Trump, speaking about economy, about economical cooperation with my country, with Latvia, what is your message for investors in Latvia? And what is your opinion about the investment in Latvia?
President Trump. I think all three would be great places to invest: stable governments, incredible people—hard-working, industrious people. I think they would be great places to invest. I would have no problem with it. Although, I think as President of the United States, they would call it a slight conflict of interest, perhaps. [Laughter] You might be hearing from these people.
No, I think it would be a great place. I think all three would be a great place to invest. Okay?
Q. Thank you.
President Trump. Thank you.
President Kalilaid. Maria, Estonian TV.
Russia-U.S. Relations/North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Q. Maria-Ann Rohemäe, Estonian Public Broadcasting. First a question to President Trump. As said, the concern of the Baltic States is Russia. And before the press conference, you also said that, at the same time, a good relationship with Russia is not bad. But how are you going to deal with President Vladimir Putin? Is he as your enemy or as someone you can have dialogue with?
And the second question is to our President Kersti Kaljulaid. Is the defense of the Baltic States enough, or should there be something more? For example, air defense systems. Thank you.
President Trump. Well, I think we'll be able to have great dialogue, I hope. And if we can't, you'll be the first to know about it. Nobody has been tougher on Russia than I have. And you can—and I know you're nodding yes, because everyone agrees when they think about it—strong energy, the United States. My opponent was into other forms of energy, like windmills. We're very strong on energy. We're, essentially, now energy independent. We're an exporter of energy. That is not a positive for Russia, but it's certainly a positive for the United States. We just passed a $700 billion military budget; next year, $716 billion, the largest ever passed. We are going to have a military stronger than we've ever had before, by far. That's not exactly a great thing for Russia, but that's the way it is. We're going to have the strongest military that we ever had.
NATO: NATO was delinquent. They were not paying their bills. They were not paying. A lot of states, as we discussed, they were not paying what they should be paying. Since I came in, many, many billions of dollars additional have been paid by countries that weren't paying, and now they're paying. And they will have to pay more, frankly. They're going to have to pay more.
So there are many things that I've done and not only the 60 diplomats. Germany did four. France did four. We did 60. There's nobody been tougher on Russia. And with that being said, I think I could have a very good relationship with President Putin. I think. It's possible I won't. And you will know about it. [Laughter] Believe me, this room will know about it before I know about it. It's a real possibility that I could have a good relationship.
And remember this: Getting along with Russia is a good thing. Getting along with China is a good thing. Getting along with other countries, including your three countries, is a good thing, not a bad thing. So I think I could have a very good relationship with Russia and with President Putin. And if I did, that would be a great thing. And there's also a great possibility that that won't happen. Who knows? Okay? Thank you. Okay, another one.
President Kaljulaid. If I may, Maria-Ann, I would also like to contribute a little bit to your first question. As I reminded you all, we could trust the judgment of United States administrations and people, even while we were occupied. We could trust your judgment when we regained independence and seek membership of NATO, for example. We could, because we are on a common foundation. You can walk around the Mall and read. It's all written there. This foundation, our compass for both. And therefore, I trust the judgment of President Trump and his administration on that matter too.
Now, on your concrete question on air defense: Yes, we did discuss the deterrence capacity necessary to make sure that our deterrence is believable to everybody who might want to question it. But you know, equal partners don't come to talk to each other this way—that I come here to Washington to ask for visa freedom, or I come here to ask for, let's say, may you support me for this or for that. We analyze situation together, and we find the solutions together which will work for us all together, because we are in it all together. We are contributors—equal contributors—according to our size, to this process of guaranteeing our security.
Thank you.
President Trump. Okay.
President Vejonis. Maybe I will add to—that today, during our summit, we discussed security issues in our region with President Trump. And I am sure that this discussion will help a lot to continue any political dialogue with our eastern neighbor, Russia.
President Trump. Good. Pick a reporter, please. You can pick a reporter, a Baltic reporter, ideally. [Laughter] Real news, not fake news. Go ahead.
Do you want to pick? I think we have enough. Do we have enough? Yes? Go ahead. Pick—Mr. President, pick a reporter from the Baltics. Not the same man; he was very tough. Go ahead, pick a reporter.
President Vejonis. Okay, I can——
President Trump. Yes, go ahead. Yes, please.
Q. Hi. My name is Anud. I'm from Latvia. So I have a question for our President from Latvia. You're going to San Francisco after your meeting here in Washington, and you're meeting some people who are making business connections from Latvia and the U.S. Do you see any certain outcomes out of that?
Thank you.
President Vejonis. First of all, I think, during our summit I will repeat again that we discussed how we can strengthen our economic cooperation between Baltic States and the U.S. And of course, my visit to California, to Silicon Valley, will give, I think, good basis for better understanding what our businesspeople need to be presented here and what I can help—how I can help them to be here. Because, anyway, I think all these cooperations between Baltic States businesspeople and U.S. businesspeople is very important for our societies—for our business societies.
And, as I said, we are thinking not only about investments in our country, and we are trying to make better environment for investments in all of our countries, but also our businesspeople are invested here. And I think it is important for both countries: for Latvia and for U.S.—for the U.S.
President Trump. I just want to conclude by saying that I am very impressed with these three great Baltic nations and these three great Presidents. Thank you very much for being here
Thank you, everybody. Thank you."

President Trump. Thank you very much. I want to begin today by expressing my deep condolences to the entire Bush family on the passing of former First Lady Barbara Bush, a wonderful, wonderful person. For decades, Barbara was a titan in American life. Her presence and character were engraved into America's identity.
Her strength and toughness really embodied the spirit of our country. And her warmth and devotion earned the admiration of an entire Nation and, indeed, the entire world. She was a tireless champion for literacy. She was a fierce advocate for the American family. And she was a woman of proud patriotism and profound faith.
Our hearts are saddened by her passing, but our spirits are lifted by the memories of her goodness and her grace. She was a good person. Melania and I send our prayers to Barbara's husband of 73 years—I'll never beat that record—President George H.W. Bush; to the surviving children Jeb and Neil and Marvin, Dorothy, and former President George W. Bush; and to their many wonderful grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
U.S. Military Operations in Syria 
This evening I also want to send a message to all of the brave service members from the United States, France, and the United Kingdom who were involved in the very successful strikes on targets associated with the Syrian chemical weapons program last week. Once again, the unmatched skill of the United States military, and our great partners and allies, was demonstrated to the entire world. Missiles were shot. They tried to knock them down; they weren't in the least successful. They hit none.
The purpose of our strike was to establish a strong deterrent against the use of banned chemical weapons. Civilized nations must join together to prevent the horrors of chemical warfare and, in fact, warfare. And I think our allies really were absolutely world class, wonderful. We thank them for their support.
Japan-U.S. Relations 
Today I'm thrilled to be joined by my good friend, Prime Minister Abe of Japan, highly respected gentleman. Prime Minister, Melania and I are honored to host you and Mrs. Abe once again at Mar-a-Lago. We're grateful for the tremendous hospitality you showed us during our visit to your country last fall. It was a true privilege to be welcomed to the magnificent land of Japan, or as I've heard all my life, the Land of the Rising Sun. It's true. So great.
During our visit to Asia in November, we had tremendous success enlisting support for our campaign of maximum pressure on the North Korean regime. As you know, I will be meeting with Kim Jong Un in the coming weeks to discuss the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Hopefully, that meeting will be a great success. And we're looking forward to it. It would be a tremendous thing for North Korea and a tremendous thing for the world. So we will be doing everything possible to make it a worldwide success, not just for the United States or South Korea or North Korea or Japan, but for the entire world.
We hope to see the day when the whole Korean Peninsula can live together in safety, prosperity, and peace. This is the destiny of the Korean people who deserve and have gone through so much over the years. We hope it all works out; we'll be trying very hard.
I want to thank the Prime Minister for his insight and support over the past year as we have pursued the dream of a peaceful, nuclear-free Korea. Shinzo, you have worked very hard, along with us and all of our people, and we thank you very much. And we're with you. And you're a lot closer than we are, but we're working on this together. Okay? Thank you very much. Your support has been critical to getting us to this important moment in time. It's a historic moment and possibly beyond that if it works out properly.
Our discussions today reaffirmed the close cooperation between the United States and Japan on the issue of North Korea and our common defense. We will not repeat the mistakes of previous administrations. Our campaign of maximum pressure will continue until North Korea denuclearizes. We have great respect for many aspects of what they're doing, but we have to get it together. We have to end nuclear weapons, ideally in all parts of the world. That would be a goal for all of us to hope for and to cherish.
As I've said before, there is a bright path available to North Korea when it achieves denuclearization in a complete and verifiable and irreversible way. It will be a great day for them. It will be great day for the world.
During my visit to Japan last fall, I met with Japanese families who endured the terrible heartbreak of having their loved ones abducted by the North Korean regime. We want to see these families reunited as soon as possible. And I know for a fact that it's one of the truly most important things on Shinzo's mind. We talk about it often. It's so important to you. And we're going to do everything possible to have them brought back and bring them back to Japan. I gave you that promise.
The United States also supports Japan's efforts to improve its defense capabilities, and we're exploring ways to expedite the sale of American military equipment to Japan through the Foreign Military Sales program. We've stepped up our effort not only with respect to Japan, but other allies, that when they order military equipment from us, we will get it taken care of, and they will get their equipment rapidly. It would be, in some cases, years before orders would take place because of bureaucracy with Department of Defense, State Department. We are short-circuiting that. It's now going to be a matter of days. If they're our allies, we are going to help them get this very important, great military equipment. And nobody—nobody—makes it like the United States. It's the best in the world by far.
We're also working to improve our economic partnership by reducing our trade imbalance and removing barriers to U.S. exports. The United States is committed to free, fair, and reciprocal—very important word—trade. And we're committed to pursuing a bilateral trading relationship that benefits both of our great countries. Prime Minister Abe and I have agreed to intensify our trade and investment consultations. Ambassador Lighthizer, who's with us today, will take the lead for the United States.
These past 2 days have been extremely productive. The friendship between Japan and the United States has never been closer. I truly believe it has never been closer than it is today. And the bonds between our people have never been stronger. In the months ahead, we will rely on this great friendship as we face an array of old challenges and new opportunities, and we will face them together. We will work closely on trade. We will do something having to do with the imbalance that, frankly, should have been done for years and years and years.
Mr. Prime Minister, I want to thank you again for traveling to Mar-a-Lago for these important discussions and meetings. It's been a true honor to welcome you here and to work with you toward greater security, prosperity, and peace for our two truly great and wonderful nations. And thank you for being here, Shinzo. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Prime Minister Abe. Mrs. Barbara Bush, the former First Lady, she has passed away. On representing the Japanese people, I would like to express my condolences to former President Bush and to all the family members. We express our heartfelt condolences.
For the infinitely blue sky, refreshing and a soothing sea breeze, it was a great pleasure to be invited once again to this beautiful Mar-a-Lago and in a relaxed atmosphere to spend significant length of time with President Trump to engage in fruitful discussion in a frank and straightforward manner.
About a year ago at this place, at the very moment I was at dinner with President Trump, North Korea dared to launch ballistic missiles. It is absolutely intolerable. Immediately after I said so, President Trump stepped forward in front of the camera, though it was not planned, and made one following comment: The U.S. is with our ally, Japan, a hundred percent. The President sent out a message of powerful commitment to the world. Donald, your words on that occasion is still deeply etched in my mind, together with my wonderful memory of my stay here in Mar-a-Lago. With one single comment, you demonstrated the superbly strong Japan-U.S. alliance, which has a history of longer than half a century.
And I once again express my deepest respect for your remarkable leadership. A year also has passed since then. The situation surrounding North Korea, due to the decisive decision by President Trump on the first-ever U.S.-North Korea summit, is at a historical turning point. The past mistakes should never be repeated. On this point, President Trump and I were in full agreement.
On the occasion of the 1994 framework agreement or the 2005 six-party talks agreement, North Korea committed to abandon nuclear weapons development. But those promises were broken, and the effort of the international community to engage in dialogue were all entirely exploited to buy time to develop nuclear weapons and more missiles.
Based on such lessons learned, both the U.S. and Japan, together with the international community, we will demand that for all weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles complete a verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles to North Korea. By envisioning multiple scenarios, we carefully thought out our policies and directions at a concrete and detailed level.
Just because North Korea is responding to dialogue, there should be no reward. Maximum pressure should be maintained, and actual implementation of concrete actions towards denuclearization will be demanded. This firm policy has once again been completely shared between us.
On this occasion, we also agreed to continue our effort towards the earlier resolution of the top priority matter of abduction. Just now President Trump, on this spot here, has mentioned that with the return of the abductees, maximum effort will be made. With the clear promise just made here, we are deeply encouraged, Donald. Half a year ago, when you visited our country, you listened intently to each and every family members of the abductees. You listened carefully and kindly said you would like to help. Your image on that occasion is indelibly etched in the eyes and minds of many of the Japanese people. Going forward, we wish to work closely with the United States and towards the immediate return of all abductees. We are determined to strengthen our approach vis-à-vis North Korea.
North Korea has diligent workforce and is blessed with resources. If North Korea advances in the right direction, they can make their populations richer. If North Korea takes the right path under the Japan-North Korea Pyongyang Declaration, there could be a possible path to settle the unfortunate past and to normalize diplomatic relationship.
For that to happen, a comprehensive resolution of multiple concerns—including abduction, nuclear, and missiles—will be the fundamental precondition. Through the upcoming historic U.S.-North Korea summit, we strongly hope for a breakthrough in this situation.
The Japan-U.S. alliance is not just limited to the sphere of security, but it also contributes to the peace and prosperity of the world, as well as the region. On the economic front, Japan and the U.S. will take a lead and develop a free and fair market in the Indo-Pacific region.
I spent some time with President Trump to discuss ways to make that happen in a candid manner. First of all, we must further strengthen the economic ties between the two countries. Under President Trump, exports from the U.S.—including energy, aircraft, amongst others—have already been increasing significantly. Further, following the bold tax reform by President Trump, Japanese companies' investments in the U.S. have been gaining momentum, which is creating a large number of jobs in the U.S. and contributing to the expansion of the exports from the U.S.
In order to benefit both Japan and the U.S., we'll further expand trade and investment between the two countries. Building upon that foundation, we'll aim to realize economic development in the free and open Indo-Pacific region based on fair rules. To make that happen, at this time, President Trump and I agreed to start talks for free, fair, and reciprocal trade deals. And Minister Motegi will be responsible for these talks on the side of Japan. Minister Motegi and the U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer, I hope, will have very fruitful discussions.
Over the last 2 days, President Trump and I have spent more than 7 hours together over meals and playing golf, while at the same time, we were able to hold extremely fulfilling talks in a relaxing atmosphere. The last few days were the time when I was able to further deepen my friendship and relationship of trust with President Trump.
Lastly, I'd like to express my sincere appreciation to Donald and First Lady Melania for their wonderful hospitality, as well as the continued warmhearted welcome of the people of the United States. Thank you.
President Trump. Thank you very much, Shinzo. Appreciate it.

U.S. Citizens Held Captive in North Korea/North Korea's Nuclear Weapons Program/China/South Korea/U.S. Tariffs on Imported Aluminum and Steel 
Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Mr. Prime Minister, nice to see you again. Mr. President, you sent your CIA Director to Pyongyang a couple of weeks ago, and he returned without three Americans who are being detained there and also without any other visible signs of concessions the North Koreans had made to the United States in advance of your meeting with Mr. Kim.
My question is: Do you intend or are you willing to sit down with Kim Jong Un if Americans are still being held in North Korea? And will you insist on other tangible concessions from the North Koreans in return for gestures like sending a potential future Secretary of State to North Korea?
And for the Prime Minister, if I may, you, a moment ago, alluded to new trade talks between your minister and Mr. Lighthizer. Should we interpret that to mean that you are now open to negotiating a bilateral trade deal between the United States and Japan?
And then, a second question: Japan is the only major American ally that was not exempted from the steel tariffs. Did you ask the President to exempt Japan? And if so, how did he reply?
President Trump. Thank you, Mark, very much. The fact is that they do have three prisoners. We have been talking about them. We are negotiating now. We are doing our very best. As you know, they've been there a long time, and it's harsh treatment. We fought very hard to get Otto Warmbier back. And when we came back, he was in very, very bad condition. It was a very sad event.
We are likewise fighting very diligently to get the three American citizens back. I think there's a good chance of doing it. We're having very good dialogue. We will keep you informed. But we are in there, and we are working very hard on that.
We have come a long way with North Korea. We were, as you know—and when I say ""we"", for many years, they've been talking to North Korea and nothing has happened. This should have been taken care of by past administrations when they were not nearly so far along. But we put unbelievably powerful sanctions on and many other things.
I want to thank publicly President Xi of China, who has done more for us than he's done for any other administration or than any leader of China has done for any President or administration. He has clogged up the border, as you know, and he's done it very, very powerfully. He would tell you himself that he never thought he would go to this extent, and I appreciate that very much. But it's put a lot of pressure on.
And, as you know, 93 percent of the goods coming into North Korea come in from China. And President Xi understands that this is a very important set of months that are lying ahead. He doesn't want to see a Korea—North Korea or any Korea—that has nuclear weapons either. So he's also fighting for China when it comes to this. But he has been terrific. Can he be better? I always say yes, he can be better. I said: ""President, you've been great. Can you be better? Yes."" But he's been very good, and it's had a big impact. And what we've done has had a big impact.
So we've never been in a position like this with that regime, whether it's father, grandfather, or son. And I hope to have a very successful meeting. If we don't think it's going to be successful, Mark, we won't have it. We won't have it. If I think that it's a meeting that is not going to be fruitful, we're not going to go. If the meeting, when I'm there, is not fruitful, I will respectfully leave the meeting, and we'll continue what we're doing or whatever it is that we'll continue. But something will happen. So I like always remaining flexible, and we'll remain flexible here. I've gotten it to this point. President Moon of South Korea was very generous when he said, if it weren't for Donald Trump, the Olympics would have been a total failure. It was my involvement and the involvement of our great country that made the Olympics a very successful Olympics. If you look at ticket sales prior to what took place with respect to North Korea, it was going to be a big problem, and it turned out to be a very successful Olympics.
So we've gotten us here, and I think we're going to be successful. But if for any reason I feel we're not, we end. Okay? Thank you, Mark.
Prime Minister Abe. Between President Trump and myself, for benefiting both Japan and the U.S., we are—have expanded the investment and trade based on the foundation—open and fair economic development in the Indo-Pacific region. We are—have agreed to start talks for free, fair, and reciprocal trade deals at this time.
As for section 232, Japanese steel and aluminum would not exert any negative influence on the U.S. security. Rather, it's our position that the quality of Japanese product is high. Many of those products are difficult to be replaced with, and they are greatly contributing to the U.S. industries and employment. So recognizing that, we'd like to continue to respond to this matter going forward.
President Trump. I will add that the 232, having to do with aluminum and steel tariffs—30 percent, in one case; 25 percent and 10 percent—that it's got us to the bargaining table with many nations, and, in other cases, they're paying. And it's billions of dollars coming into the coffers of the United States. So they've been, actually, very important.
If you look at what we did with solar panels, where we put 30 percent tariffs on, we had 32 companies opened with pretty new plants, because it's a relatively new industry. Of the 32 plants, 30 were closed, and 2 were not doing well. Since putting the tariffs on, the two are doing very well, seven or eight are going to be opening, and a lot more will open.
Same thing with washing machines. We were, believe it not, having washing machines dumped all over the country. We put tariffs on, and we're now opening up and expanding companies that create and make—which is actually a very big business—washing machines and dryers.
So the workers of our country know what's happening. We have companies moving up from Mexico, automobile companies, and they're building new plants in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Kentucky and expanding their plants. A lot of things are happening. Our country is doing very, very well. And it's going to continue. It's going to continue. A lot of great momentum.
If you look at any chart, the enthusiasm for business in our country is at an alltime high. And unemployment, for African American workers, for Hispanic workers, unemployment is at an alltime low. In history, in the history of our country, it's at the lowest point. If you look at unemployment for women, it's at an 18-year low. So we're very proud of our achievements.
And starting know, as you see, over the last few weeks, the tax cuts are kicking in. And it's a beautiful thing to see. And people are spending money where they didn't have the money to spend previously. So we're very happy with that.
Shinzo, please.
Japanese Citizens Held Captive in North Korea Q. I'm—[inaudible]. Now, I'd like to ask a question about how to handle North Korean issues. Prime Minister Abe, the coordination for holding summits between the South Korea and North Korea, as well between the U.S. and North Korea, is underway, there is a concern in Japan that Japan may be left behind. So how are you going to proceed with dialogue with North Korea?
President Trump, you talked about the abduction issue. Are you going to consider the nuclear weapons disarmament the same level as abduction issue?
President Trump. Well, maybe I'll go first. Abduction is a very important issue for me because it's very important to your Prime Minister. I will tell you that we were having dinner last night, and he started talking about abduction and how horrible it was. And his level of enthusiasm was unbelievable. And I said to him right then and there last night at the table, I said we will work very hard on that issue, and we will try and bring those folks back home. Very, very hard.
Prime Minister Abe. Whether Japan will be left behind, that is not at all the case. In the last 2 days, together with President Trump, we have spoken about North Korea. There will be the inter-Korean talks, and a U.S.-North Korea summit is planned. We have gone into really in-depth discussion. About our policy and direction, we have reached agreement.
Regarding the upcoming U.S.-North Korea summit, we hope that it will lead to the resolution of weapons of mass destruction, nuclear missile, and of course, more than anything else, we hope it will be a historic summit that will lead to the resolution of abduction. And for that purpose, I have seriously and thoroughly discussed it with President Trump, and we have fully agreed about our direction going forward, in particular regarding abduction. As Donald has explained in our tête-à-tête, we have thoroughly discussed about this matter.
Last year, the President met with the victims of the abduction, as well as the family members. And their families' feelings have been strongly felt and understood by the President, and he has given a very encouraging comment that he would appeal towards early resolution. I highly appreciate this encouraging comment. This gives us huge courage, a very encouraging comment. And for the families of the abductees, again, this is a massively, powerfully encouraging comment.
And therefore, going forward between Japan and the U.S., or between the trilateral of Japan, U.S., and South Korea, we will cooperate closely and do our utmost to resolve the issues of North Korea, including abduction, nuclear, and missiles.
President Trump. And we will be very loyal to Japan. Thank you.
Jennifer Jacobs [Bloomberg News].
Investigation Into Russia's Interference in 2016 Presidential Election/Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III/Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. On the Mueller probe, have you concluded that it's not worth the political fallout to remove either Special Counsel Mueller or Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein?
And, Prime Minister Abe, did the President ask you to provide more funding for U.S. troops in Japan? And what agreement did you reach here in Florida on buying more military equipment from the U.S.? President Trump. Jennifer, I can say this: that there was no collusion, and that's been so found, as you know, by the House Intelligence Committee. There's no collusion. There was no collusion with Russia, other than by the Democrats, or, as I call them, the ""obstuctionists,"" because they truly are obstructionists.
So we are giving tremendous amounts of paper. This was a—really a hoax created largely by the Democrats as a way of softening the blow of a loss, which is a loss that, frankly, they shouldn't have had from the standpoint that it's very easy for them. They have a tremendous advantage in the electoral college. And this is what it is, and this is where it came from.
You look at the kind of money that was paid. Probably, some went to Russia. You look at Podesta having a company in Russia where nothing happened and people don't talk about it. You look at the fact that their server, the DNC server, was never gotten by the FBI. Why didn't the FBI take it? The FBI takes what they want. They go in; they wouldn't get the server.
This is a hoax. As far as the investigation, nobody has ever been more transparent than I have instructed our lawyers,—""Be totally transparent."" I believe we've given them 1.4 million pages of documents, if you can believe this. And I haven't used—that I know of, or for the most part—Presidential powers or privilege.
So we are, hopefully, coming to the end. It is a bad thing for our country, very, very bad thing for our country. But there has been no collusion. They won't find any collusion. It doesn't exist.
As far as the two gentlemen you told me about, they've been saying I'm going to get rid of them for the last 3 months, 4 months, 5 months. And they're still here. So we want to get the investigation over with, done with, put it behind us. And we have to get back to business with negotiating with this gentleman and plenty of others. But this gentleman is a very tough negotiator, and we have to focus on that.
Thank you very much.
Prime Minister Abe. Regarding the U.S. forces expenses, of the U.S. forces in Japan, the safety and security of Japan and the peace and stability of the Far East is being maintained. And for the forward deployment strategy of the United States in the Asia-Pacific, in terms of the presence, their presence in Japan is very meaningful and significant. In the case of Japan, across the world, in terms of paying for the expenses, Japan accounts for the largest percentage of stationing compared to other countries. And the President understands very well.
Japan-U.S. Trade/Trans-Pacific Partnership 
Q. I'm—[inaudible]—with Sankei News. I have a question for President Trump. This is the follow-up question for 232. So you don't have any intention to exempt Japan at this point in time? And President Trump and Prime Minister Abe, with regard to trade, you are going to establish new talks for trade. Is it going to be in the direction of FTA or TPP? So we'd like—I'd like to hear the views from both of you.
Prime Minister Abe. So at this time, between President Trump, talks for free, fair, and reciprocal trade deals, to initiate that has been agreed. As for this talk, Minister Motegi and Ambassador Lighthizer, USTR, will be the representative. And Mr. Aso and Vice President Pence, the U.S.-Japan economic dialogue where they will be receiving the report of these talks. As for these talks, I thought that it would be the interest of both of the countries that the investment and trade between the two countries will be expanded. And we are going to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific economic growth.
So on the U.S. side, that they are interested in a bilateral deal, we are aware of that. But at any rate, our country's position is that TPP is the best for both of the countries. And based on that position, we shall be dealing with the talks.
President Trump. Thank you very much. The United States has a massive trade deficit with Japan. It's anywhere from $69 billion to $100 billion a year. That's massive by any standpoint. We are doing 232 on steel and aluminum. And if we can come to an arrangement on a new deal between the United States and Japan, that would certainly be something we would discuss, aluminum tariffs and steel tariffs. And I would look forward to being able to, at some point in the future, take them off.
But right now we have a deficit that's a minimum of $69 billion a year. Japan sends us millions and millions of cars, and we tax them virtually not at all. And we don't send so much product, because we have trade barriers and lots of other things. So these are the things that the Prime Minister and I are going to be discussing over the next short period of time.
The media has not covered the TPP correctly. I don't want to go back into TPP, but if they offered us a deal that I can't refuse, on behalf of the United States, I would do it. But I like bilateral better. I think it's better for our country. I think it's better for our workers. And I much would prefer a bilateral deal, a deal directly with Japan. We already have a deal with 6 of the 11 nations in the TPP. So we already have trade deals, and the others we can make very easily. They're all calling wanting to make a deal. But we think that's much better for us.
So unless they offer us a deal that we cannot refuse, I would not go back into TPP. We'll see what happens. But in the meantime, we're negotiating. And what I really prefer is negotiating a one-on-one deal with Japan. And that's where we are right now, and I will say that the representatives who are sitting right here are extraordinarily competent and very tough, those representing Japan. And we will hopefully, in the not-too-distant future, have a very good deal, good for Japan and good for the United States. Okay?
Thank you all very much. We appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Prime Minister Abe. Thank you.
President Trump. Thank you very much, Shinzo.
U.S. Sanctions Against Russia/Syria 
Q. Anything sanctions on Russia, sir?
Q. Why no sanctions on Russia, sir?
Q. Mr. President, why did you delay the sanctions on Russia?
President Trump. Yes, we'll do sanctions. As soon as they very much deserve it, we will have—that is a question. There has been nobody tougher on Russia than President Donald"," Trump. Between building up the military, between creating tremendous vast amounts of oil. We raised billions and billions of dollars extra in NATO. We had a very, very severe—we were talking about it a little while—fight in Syria recently, a month ago, between our troops and Russian troops, and that's very sad. But many people died in that fight. There has been nobody tougher than me. With the media, no matter what I did, it's never tough enough, because that's their narrative. But Russia will tell you, there has been nobody tougher than Donald Trump. And then, the other night, we had a strike in Syria, which was absolute precision.
I leave it with this, with all of that said: If we can get along with China, and if we can get along with Russia, and if we can get along with Japan and other nations, that's a good thing, not a bad thing. Just remember that. If we got along with other nations, that's good, not bad.
Thank you very much, everybody."
"April 30, 2018",The President's News Conference With President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria,Donald J. Trump,"Donald J. Trump, The President's News Conference With President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/332542",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-muhammadu-buhari-nigeria,"President Trump. Thank you very much. Thank you. Today I'm honored to host President Buhari of Nigeria at the White House, right here in the beautiful Rose Garden. President Buhari, I want thank you very much for traveling to Washington for these important discussions. It's a true pleasure to welcome you to our Nation's Capital.
Nigeria is the largest democracy in Africa. As I conveyed to President Buhari in our discussions, the United States deeply values and appreciates Nigeria's role as a strong, democratic leader in the region. The United States is currently working to expand trade and commercial ties with African nations, including Nigeria, to create jobs and wealth in all of our countries. We hope to be the economic partner of choice for nations across the continent and all around the world. And you see what's happening with respect to trade and the United States. We are being respected again.
I hope all African countries and countries throughout the world, that we also will be supporting you and that they will likewise support us in our bid, along with Canada and Mexico, for the 2026 World Cup. We will be watching very closely, and any help that they could give us in that bid we would appreciate.
I'm pleased that Nigeria is one of our largest trading partners in the region, and we look forward to growing our trade relationship based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity. But we give Nigeria well over $1 billion in aid every year. And we have already started talking with the President about taking down the trade barriers—very substantial barriers—to the United States trading with Nigeria. So we think that we are owed that.
President Buhari has also taken several steps to fight corruption and improve the Nigerian business climate. And most of all to me—and again—is ripping down those trade barriers. These measures will make it easier for Nigeria and the United States companies to invest. And we will be investing substantially in Nigeria if they can create that level playing field that we have to very much ask for and maybe demand.
I especially want to thank President Buhari for Nigeria's partnership and leadership in the fight against terrorism. He's been a real leader. Nigeria was one of the first African nations to join the coalition to defeat ISIS, and Nigerian forces are currently leading regional efforts against ISIS in West Africa and doing very well, as we have.
Nigeria is also leading African nations in the fight against Boko Haram and—another ruthless jihadist terrorist group. You've been reading about them. They kidnap the young girls and young women, many of whom never are seen again. It's tough stuff. This summer, it was my honor to meet with two brave young women, Joy Bishara and Lydia Pogu, who were kidnapped by Boko Haram in April of 2014 at the secondary school in Nigeria. I was deeply moved by their inspiring stories of courage, resilience, and survival. They really were two amazing young women.
I told Joy and Lydia, my administration is committed to combating both jihadist terrorism and the scourge of human trafficking and smuggling. In the world today, there is more human trafficking than there has ever been, if you can believe this. They use the internet better than almost anybody is able to use the internet. So think of it, in a modern world, in this world, there's more human trafficking and slavery than at any time in the history of this world. It's hard to believe.
To protect Americans from these menaces, I have called on Congress to close deadly immigration loopholes that are exploited by terrorists, traffickers, and criminals. Just look at our southern border and our weak and obsolete immigration laws. They are obsolete, and they are weak, and they are pathetic. And there's no country in the world that has laws like we do. They've got to change, and they've got to change now for the safety of our country.
We're also helping our Nigerian partners by facilitating intelligence cooperation and providing training and military equipment to Nigerian forces. For example, we recently sold Nigeria 12 U.S. A-29 Super Tucano aircraft—it's a great aircraft—in the first-ever [major; White House correction.] sale of American military equipment to Nigeria. These new aircraft will improve Nigeria's ability to target terrorists and protect civilians.
Finally, we're deeply concerned by religious violence in Nigeria, including the burning of churches and the killing and persecution of Christians. It's a horrible story. We encourage Nigeria and the federal, state, and local leaders to do everything in their power to immediately secure the affected communities and to protect innocent civilians of all faiths, including Muslims and including Christians.
Mr. President, thank you again for visiting the White House and being with us today. Nigeria is a valued partner and a good friend. I look forward to working closely with you to deepen our cooperation and forge an even closer partnership. The United States is committed to working alongside Nigeria as we seek a future of strength, prosperity, and peace for both of our countries.
Mr. President, thank you very much. Thank you.
President Buhari. Mr. President of the United States of America, ladies and gentlemen of the media, it has been a pleasure and honor to visit Washington, DC, at the kind invitation of President Donald Trump.
Nigeria and the United States share a long history of close and cordial relations which encompass political, economic, military, social, and cultural cooperation. Our two countries maintain a strategic partnership for peace and security, conflict resolution, as well as a global fight against terrorism. We also share common features as secular, federal states practicing a similar democratic model of governance and committed to the universal values of fundamental human rights and freedoms: free enterprise, social justice, and rule of law.
President Trump and his team and myself and the Nigerian team discussed issues related to security, trade, governance, human rights, and humanitarian crises. We congratulated the leaders of the North and South Korea on their historic summit, and we applaud them for the positive commitment they have made towards denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. President Trump deserves a great deal of credit for his statesmanly role in transforming so dramatically the course of events in that region.
We also congratulated the United States Government on the important role it played in the defeat of ISIS, although some of the remnants have found their way to the Sahel region. We recognize the strong United States support in our fight against terrorism and also appreciated very much the United States agreement to sell 12 Super Tucano A-29 warplanes and weapons to Nigeria to effectively fight terrorism.
To contain the spate of insurgency in Nigeria, the federal Government has adopted a multisectorial approach involving related Government agencies to address the social, economic, and political dimensions, while the armed forces of Nigeria assist the civil authority to provide security and maintain law and order.
As part of efforts to address emergent cases of insurgency in the country, the Nigerian military adopted counterterrorism insurgency approach, codenamed Operation Safe Corridor, to deradicalize, rehabilitate, and reintegrate willingly surrendered Boko Haram members into the larger society. This program is currently embarking on a number of projects, including skill acquisition centers and integrated farms comprising poultry, fish pond, and greenhouse farming, among others.
A number of international partners, including the International Organization for Migration, have contributed to the success of Operation Safe Corridor. We indicated that we will appreciate whatever support we could also get from the United States. We express gratitude to the United States support in the reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts in the northeast of Nigeria, as well as humanitarian assistance to the internally displaced persons, through agencies such as the United States Agency for International Development and other international partners.
The United States of America has been, to date, the biggest contributor to the humanitarian response. And last year, it gave approximately half-a-billion United States dollars in cash and in-kind contributions through the United Nations and other intergovernmental organizations. This has mainly supported protection activities: health, food assistance, and shelter.
We are doing all we can to secure the release of the remaining abducted schoolgirls from Dapchi and Chibok. In this context, we will continue to welcome United States collaboration in intelligence gathering, hostage negotiations, and information sharing. The Government is taking necessary steps to promote the peaceful coexistence of herdsmen and farmers by focusing on boosting security and enforcing legislation that will guarantee borders and farmers' access to land.
I extend sincere congratulations to President Trump and his Government on the impressive performance of the United States economy under his watch. Our aim is to diversify our own economy by focusing on agricultural and food security, power and infrastructure. We have cut the importation of rice by 90 percent, thereby saving a significant amount of money.
We very much welcome increased United States investment in Nigerian economy, especially the nonoil sector. Economic relations between Nigeria and the United States are anchored on three major instruments, namely the binational commission, trade and investment framework agreement, and the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act. The binational commission, in particular—comprising bilateral, political, economic, governmental, and humanitarian partnership—is a basic economic framework for engagement between our two countries.
Nigeria's trade volume with the United States stood at 6.07 billion United States dollars according to 2016 statistics and comprised 4.76 billion United States dollars, also, of Nigerian exports to the United States and 1.894 billion United States dollars exports to Nigeria. We urge greater effort to increase these figures substantially. We thank the United States Government very much for cooperation we have received in our effort to recover stolen funds. Our two governments have put the machinery in place for their respective Attorney Generals to collaborate in ensuring the return to Nigeria of over 500 million United States dollars of looted funds siphoned away in banks around the world.
In this connection, we congratulate the United States Government on launching a Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, which was spearheaded by the United States Department of Justice's Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering. We hoped that we could continue to count on United States support in this area.
The Government of Nigeria remains deeply committed to the principles of human rights, as well as promotion and protection of people's freedom, even in the process of fighting terror. We commit to ensure that all documented cases of human rights abuses are investigated and those responsible for violation held responsible.
I thank you very much for listening.
President Trump. Well, thank you, Mr. President. Thank you very much. Thank you, sir.
Steve Miller of the Washington Times, please. Washington Times. Thank you, Steve.
Immigration Reform 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I had a two-parter on immigration. Last week, in the Supreme Court case over your travel ban, the lawyers for the opponents said that if you would simply apologize for some of your rhetoric during the campaign, the whole case would go away. And I was wondering if you would be willing——
President Trump. I don't think it would, number one. And there is no reason to apologize. Our immigration laws in this country are a total disaster. They're laughed at all over the world—they're laughed at—for their stupidity. And we have to have strong immigration laws.
So I think if I apologize, it wouldn't make 10 cents worth of difference to them. There's nothing to apologize for. We have to have strong immigration laws to protect our country.
Central American Migrants Seeking Asylum in the U.S./Immigration Reform/Border Security 
Q. And looking to the future: The caravan has arrived at the U.S. border.
President Trump. We've been watching it. We've been watching it, Steve.
Q. And I'm just wondering, in your opinion—or of your estimation—what percentage of those people do you believe are deserving of asylum in the U.S.?
President Trump. Well, I won't get into percentages. But we are a nation of laws. We have to have borders. We don't have borders, we don't have a country. And I've been watching for weeks as the caravan came up. And you know, the Mexican laws are very tough on immigration, extremely tough. And it started out with way over a thousand people—I guess now it's down to about a hundred—going all through Mexico. People don't realize what a big country Mexico is. But it came down by a lot.
And now we're working on the border with the worst laws any country—no matter where you go, all over the world, they can't even believe it. And we're doing the best we can with it. But we have to have changes in Congress, and we have to have it quickly. We need a wall, number one. And you see that right now. You know, where they are—even though it's not a particularly good wall and even though a small percentage can climb to the top, they have to be in extremely good shape. But a small percentage can climb that particular wall. We have a wall that's much more difficult.
But if you didn't have that, you would have thousands of people just pouring into our country. You've got to have a wall. And we need border security, and we will have border security. As you know, we're sending many, many National Guardsmen down to the border—most of them are already there—and that's having a big impact. But we need a change in the law. Catch-and-release is ridiculous. If they touch our property, if they touch our country, essentially, you catch them, and you release them into our country. That's not acceptable to anybody. So we need a change in the law.
Q. Mr. President, when you were sitting down in the Oval Office with President Trump, who ran on not wanting to be the policeman for the world, what kind of arguments did you make to convince him to continue a military presence for the U.S. in your country? And what arguments did you make to him? How receptive was he?
President Buhari. I can't understand what you mean by United States presence in my country. They sent a training team, based on their experiences, to train our officers at some of our training institutions and move to the crisis area to see how well the trainers are performing. I think this is one of the best things the United States could do for us to stabilize the country.
U.S. Foreign Policy/Trade 
Q. And he agreed with that?
President Buhari. I do, very much so. That's why I thank him for it.
Q. Thank you.
President Trump. Well, we more and more are—because it's a very fair question—we more and more are not wanting to be the policeman of the world. And we're spending tremendous amounts of money for decades on policing the world, and that shouldn't be our priority. We want to police ourselves, and we want to rebuild our country. And the President understands that. And they've come a long way. They're doing a great job. We're contributing to that job, but they have done a great job.
What we do want to do, though, is open Nigeria and other countries up to trade, because we have spent, over the last decade, a number that's so large you wouldn't even believe it. And I think we'll be treated in a reciprocal fashion now, as of today. So I think that's going to happen.
And I have great respect for the President. Okay?
Q. Thank you.
President Trump. How about Jordan Fabian? Where's Jordan? Jordan. The Hill.
Q. Thank you.
President Trump. Thank you.
Iran/Israel 
Q. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to ask you about Iran. The Israeli Prime Minister just gave a speech very critical of their nuclear program. I wanted to ask if you have made up your mind to pull out of that deal. And if you do pull out of that deal, do you think—are you worried that it sends the wrong message to North Korea, as you seek to enter nuclear talks with Kim Jong Un?
President Trump. No, I think it sends the right message. You know, in 7 years that deal will have expired and Iran is free to go ahead and create nuclear weapons. That's not acceptable. Seven years is tomorrow. That's not acceptable.
So no, if anything, it's proven right what Israel has done today with the news conference. And Prime Minister Netanyahu just gave a very—I don't know if everybody has seen it, but I got to see a little bit of it. And that is just not an acceptable situation. And I've been saying that's happening. They're not sitting back idly. They're setting off missiles, which they say are for television purposes. I don't think so.
So we'll see what happens. I'm not telling you what I'm doing, but a lot of people think they know. And on or before the 12th, we'll make a decision. That doesn't mean we won't negotiate a real agreement. You know, this is an agreement that wasn't approved by too many people. And it's a horrible agreement for the United States, including the fact, Mr. President, that we gave Iran $150 billion and $1.8 billion in cash—Nigeria would like some of that—$1.8 billion in cash and $150 billion. You know what we got? We got nothing. We got nothing.
So that doesn't mean I wouldn't negotiate a new agreement. We'll see what happens. But I think, if anything, what's happening today and what's happened over the last little while and what we've learned, has really shown that I've been 100 percent right.
Africa 
Q. And, President Buhari, I want to ask you: You're the first leader from sub-Saharan Africa to visit President Trump here at the White House. Did you address his reported comments from early this year when he reportedly used vulgar language to describe African nations?
President Buhari. Well, I'm very careful with what the press says about others than myself. I'm not sure about, you know, the validity or whether that allegation against the President was true or not. So the best thing for me is to keep quiet.
President Trump. We didn't discuss it. [Laughter] And you do have some countries that are in very bad shape and very tough places to live in. But we didn't discuss it, because the President knows me, and he knows where I'm coming from. And I appreciate that. We did not discuss it.
Mr. President, you can ask a question.
President Buhari. Yes, that lady is already up. Yes.
Nigeria-U.S. Relations/Sale of Military Aircraft to Nigeria 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. My name is Giuliana. Mr. President Trump, I would like to know: Nigeria is in dire need of the Tucano aircraft to tackle the problem back home. Will you be kind enough to release at least two before 2020 to enable the country to tackle the situation in the country? And how soon will you be visiting Nigeria?
President Trump. Well, I would like to visit Nigeria. I'd like very much to visit Nigeria. It's an amazing country. And in certain ways, I hear from the standpoint of the beauty of a country, there's no country more beautiful. So I would like to. And the first part of your question, I couldn't hear what you were saying. Go ahead.
Q. The helicopters.
President Trump. Oh, helicopters?
Q. Yes.
President Trump. Oh, oh. We love helicopters. He likes them more than I do. He likes buying helicopters. But he is—and they're buying a lot of helicopters. Helicopters——
Q. We want to know how soon——
President Trump. Very soon.
Q. ——you'll be releasing them to the country.
President Trump. Yes, very soon. We're getting it approved. Part of the problem was that you weren't allowed to buy helicopters in our country, and now you are. I worked that out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want. They weren't allowed to buy the helicopters in our country for various reasons, which, frankly, were not good reasons. But now they get them, and they get them very quickly. And they are the best helicopters anywhere in the world. We make the best military equipment in the world. And our friends can now buy that equipment.
Mr. President.
President Buhari. Thank you very much.
President Trump. Did you have a question for the President?
Q. President Trump—my question is to President Trump.
President Trump. Thank you. [Laughter]
Corruption in Nigeria 
Q. The fight against corruption is one of the major achievements that the Nigerian Government has presented to the world. And the records show that United States of America is one of the major destination countries of illicit funds and assets from Nigeria. To what extent did you discuss the need to repatriate these funds back to Nigeria to fund critical infrastructure, to cut down funding for terrorism, and also to reduce our illegal immigration from Nigeria to your country?
President Trump. Yes. We have actually discussed all of those topics at length over the last period of time. And in terms of corruption, Nigeria has a reputation, as you understand very well, for very massive corruption. I also know that the President has been able to cut that down very substantially. We talked about it; he is working on it. And they have made a lot of progress, and I think they will continue to make a lot of progress.
We have a lot of people in this country and, frankly, the country itself, that invests in Nigeria. So cutting down on that corruption element and a corrupt element is very important to us. And the President will be able to do that.
President.
Nigeria-U.S. Trade Q. And to Mr. President—to President Buhari: The United States import of crude oil from Nigeria has considerably gone down. Did you discuss the need for the U.S. to increase the import of crude oil from Nigeria?
President Buhari. No, I can't tell the United States what to do. But luckily for us, we have good market for our crude oil elsewhere. But the progress made by United States in technology is largely—is actually frightening for such a monoeconomy. I hope technology will allow them to use our crude for its quality for petrochemicals—[inaudible]—vis-a-vis the ones they are getting from shale.
Thank you.
President Trump. I think maybe more than anything else, what we discussed today was agricultural products going into Nigeria, which Nigeria wants. But we have certain barriers that don't allow that to happen. So for the good of our farmers—U.S. farmers—and for the good of Nigeria and all of Africa, it's very important that we are able to sell our great agricultural products into Nigeria. And that will happen, and we're going to be working on that right away. Okay?
Thank you all very much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you.
North Korea 
Q. Mr. President, will you meet Kim at the DMZ, sir?
Q. [Inaudible]
President Trump. It's possible. It's very possible.
Q. Is the DMZ another location you'll discuss—[inaudible]? [Laughter]
President Trump. Well, it was an interesting thought. And I had that thought. We're looking at various countries, including Singapore. And we are also talking about the possibility of the DMZ—Peace House/Freedom House.
And there's something that I thought was intriguing. I think that some people maybe don't like the look of that, and some people like it very much. I threw it out today as an idea. I also told President Moon, and through President Moon, we connected with North Korea. There's something that I like about it, because you're there. You're actually there—where, if things work out, there's a great celebration to be had on the site, not in a third-party country.
So we are looking at the possibility of doing it in that location. We're also looking at various other countries, including Singapore. I will say this, the good news: Everybody wants us. It has the chance to be a big event.
Q. [Inaudible]
President Trump. And the United States—I was talking to John Bolton about this a little while ago—the United States has never been closer to potentially having something happen with respect to the Korean Peninsula that can get rid of the nuclear weapons, can create so many good things, so many positive things, and peace and safety for the world.
So we'll see what happens. You know, I often say, ""Who knows?"" Who knows? Maybe a lot of things change. But Kim Jong Un, who has been very open and very straightforward so far—I can only say, again, ""so far."" But he's talking about getting rid of the site, which was their big site. He's talking about no research, no launching of ballistic missiles, no nuclear testing. And he has lived up to that for a long period of time, a longer period of time than anybody has seen.
So we are looking at that as a potential site, yes. I think it would be very interesting. I think it would be a great celebration if it works out well. And if it doesn't work out well, that's the way it goes.
Q. [Inaudible]—the timeframe——
Q. Are you still confident the summit will happen? Is there anything that can——
President Trump. Oh, yes, I think the summit is going to happen. They very much want it. We certainly would like to see it. I think the summit will happen. And personally, I think it's going to be a success. But we'll see. I will say this: If it's not a success—if it's not a success——
Q. How do you define success?
President Trump. He's got to get rid of the nuclear weapons. If it's not a success, I will respectfully leave. It's very simple.
Thank you all very much. Thank you.
Q. What about the timeframe? Have you—[inaudible]—the timeframe?"
"June 09, 2018","The President's News Conference in Charlevoix, Canada",Donald J. Trump,"Donald J. Trump, The President's News Conference in Charlevoix, Canada Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/332594",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-charlevoix-canada,"The President. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate it. We're getting ready to make a big trip. We're just leaving, but we wanted to have a little bit of a conference just to announce what's happened, how we've done. And I think it's been very, very successful. We've concluded a really tremendously successful G-7 and would like to provide you with an update.
And you know the gentlemen up are the legendary Larry Kudlow and the legendary John Bolton. We had a good meeting, both on defense and environment and, frankly, on tariffs, which are what we're here for.
First, I'd like to thank Prime Minister Trudeau for hosting this summit. It has worked out to be so wonderful. The people of Canada are wonderful, and it's a great country and a very beautiful country, I might add.
We tackled a variety of issues and opportunities facing our nations. At the top of the list was the issue of trade—a very important subject—because the United States has been taken advantage of for decades and decades, and we can't do that anymore. We had extremely productive discussions on the need to have fair and reciprocal, meaning, the same. People can't charge us 270 percent, and we charge them nothing. That doesn't work anymore.
I made a lot of statements having to do with clarity. We want and expect other nations to provide fair market access to American exports, and that we will take whatever steps are necessary to protect American industry and workers from unfair foreign trading practices, of which, really, there are many. But we're getting them straightened out, slowly but surely.
We also discussed the issue of uncontrolled migration and the threat that it poses to both national security and other groups and countries and our citizens and quality of life. We're committed to addressing the migration challenge by helping migrants to remain and prosper in their own home countries. A wide array of national security threats were addressed, including the threat of Iran. The G-7 nations remain committed to controlling Iran's nuclear ambitions—with or without them, those ambitions are going to be controlled—along with efforts to combat terrorism and extremism and those who spread this deadly ideology.
The nations of the G-7 are bound together by shared values and beliefs. That came out loud and clear. Each of our nations is totally unique, with our own people and our own sovereign obligations, but we can coordinate together and achieve a common good—a good for all—good for all of our people, all of our nations.
We're linked in the great effort to create a more just, peaceful, and prosperous world. And from the standpoint of trade and jobs and being fair to companies, we are really, I think, committed. I think they are starting to be committed to a much more fair trade situation for the United States, because it has been treated very, very unfairly.
And I don't blame other leaders for that. I blame our past leaders. There was no reason that this should have happened. Last year, they lost eight-hundred—we as a nation, over the years—but the latest number is $817 billion on trade. That's ridiculous, and it's unacceptable. And everybody was told that. So I don't blame them; I blame our leaders. In fact, I congratulate the leaders of other countries for so crazily being able to make these trade deals that were so good for their country and so bad for the United States. But those days are over.
In just a few minutes, I'll be leaving for Singapore. I'll be on a mission of peace, and we will carry in, really—in my heart, we're going to be carrying the hearts of millions of people, people from all over the world. We have to get denuclearization. We have to get something going. We really think that North Korea will be a tremendous place in a very short period of time. And we appreciate everything that's going on. And we appreciate the working together with North Korea. They're really working very well with us.
So I say, so far, so good. We're going to have to see what happens. And we're going to know very soon. So I'll be leaving—as soon as we're finished with this conference, I'll be leaving. And I very much look forward to it. I think it's very important for North Korea and South Korea and Japan and the world and the United States. It's a great thing. And we'll see what happens.
Okay. Any questions? Yes, yes.
North Korea 
Q. Mr. President, you are about to embark on what may be the most important meeting you've ever had in your life. What's in your gut, steel nerves or butterflies? Can you describe how you feel?
The President. Well, there's always everything. It's really—you know, this has probably rarely been done. It's unknown territory, in the truest sense. But I really feel confident. I feel that Kim Jong Un wants to do something great for his people, and he has that opportunity. And he won't have that opportunity again. It's never going to be there again.
So I really believe that he's going to do something very positive for his people, for himself, his family. He's got an opportunity, the likes of which I think almost—if you look into history—very few people have ever had. He can take that nation, with those great people, and truly make it great. So it's a one-time—it's a one-time shot. And I think it's going to work out very well.
That's why I feel positive, because it makes so much sense. And we will watch over, and we'll protect, and we'll do a lot of things. I can say that South Korea, Japan, China, many countries want to see it happen. And they'll help. They'll all help. So there's a great—there's really—this is a great time. This has not happened in all of the years that they've been separated by a very artificial boundary. This is a great opportunity for peace and lasting peace and prosperity.
Yes, ma'am.
Russia/Group of Seven (G-7) Nations 
Q. Mr. President, did you raise bringing Russia back into G-7 during your meetings? And when have you last spoken to Vladimir Putin? Do you expect to meet him in Vienna this summer?
The President. Yes, I have not spoken to Vladimir Putin in quite a while. It has been discussed. We didn't do votes or anything, but it has been discussed. Some people like the idea of bringing Russia back in. This used to be the G-8, not the G-7. And something happened a while ago, where Russia is no longer in. I think it would be an asset to have Russia back in. I think it would be good for the world. I think it would be good for Russia. I think it would be good for the United States. I think it would be good for all of the countries of the current G-7.
I think the G-8 would be better. I think having Russia back in would be a positive thing. We're looking for peace in the world. We're not looking to play games.
Okay. Question? Yes.
Trade 
Q. Mr. President, excuse me, you said that this was a positive meeting, but from the outside, it seemed quite contentious. Did you get any indication from your interlocutors that you were—they were going to make any concessions to you? And I believe that you raised the idea of a tariff-free G-7. Is that——
The President. I did. Oh, I did. That's the way it should be. No tariffs, no barriers. That would—that's the way it should be.
Trade 
Q. How did it go down?
The President. And no subsidies. I even said no tariffs. In other words, let's say Canada—where we have tremendous tariffs—the United States pays tremendous tariffs on dairy. As an example, 270 percent. Nobody knows that. We pay nothing. We don't want to pay anything. Why should we pay?
We have to—ultimately, that's what you want. You want a tariff-free, you want no barriers, and you want no subsidies, because you have some cases where countries are subsidizing industries, and that's not fair. So you go tariff-free, you go barrier-free, you go subsidy-free. That's the way you learned at the Wharton School of Finance. I mean, that would be the ultimate thing. Now, whether or not that works—but I did suggest it, and people were—I guess, they're going to go back to the drawing and check it out, right?
But we can't have—an example—where we're paying—the United States is paying 270 percent. Just can't have it. And when they send things into us, you don't have that. I will say, it was not contentious. What was strong was the language that this cannot go on. But the relationships are very good, whether it be President Macron or with Justin. We had—Justin did a really good job. I think the relationships were outstanding.
But because of the fact that the United States leaders of the past didn't do a good job on trade—and again, I'm not blaming countries, I'm blaming our people that represented our past. It's got to change. It's going to change. I mean, it's not a question of ""I hope it changes."" It's going to change, a hundred percent. And tariffs are going to come way down, because we—people cannot continue to do that. We're like the piggybank that everybody is robbing. And that ends.
In fact, Larry Kudlow is a great expert on this, and he's a total free trader. But even Larry has seen the ravages of what they've done with their tariffs. Would you like to say something on that, Larry, very quickly? It might be interesting.
National Economic Council Director Lawrence A. Kudlow. One interesting point, in terms of the G-7 group meeting—I don't know if they were surprised with President Trump's free-trade proclamation, but they certainly listened to it and we had lengthy discussions about that. As the President said, all—reduce these barriers. In fact, go to zero: zero tariffs, zero nontariff barriers, zero subsidies.
And along the way, we're going to have to clean up the international trading system about which there was virtual consensus of agreement on that. And that will be a target. And these are the best ways to promote economic growth, and we'll all be better at it, and we'll all be stronger at it. So, I myself was particularly gratified to hear my President talk about free trade. Thank you, sir.
Agriculture Tariffs 
The President. Thank you.
And it's very unfair to our farmers. Our farmers are, essentially—whether it's through a barrier, nonmonetary barrier, or whether it's through very high tariffs that make it impossible—and this is all over the world. This isn't just G-7. I mean, we have India, where some of the tariffs are a hundred percent. A hundred percent. And we charge nothing. We can't do that. And so we are talking to many countries. We're talking to all countries. And it's going to stop. Or we'll stop trading with them. And that's a very profitable answer, if we have to do it.
Yes, sir.
Trade 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Another question on trade. You just said that you think that the tariffs are actually going to come down, but it does appear that these various countries are moving forward with retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. Did you get any concessions or any agreements with any of these countries not to move forward with those tariffs? And are you willing to not move forward with——
The President. Well, if they retaliate, they're making a mistake. Because, you see, we have a tremendous trade imbalance. So when we try and bring our piece up a little bit so that it's not so bad, and then they go up—right?—the difference is they do so much more business with us than we do with them that we can't lose that. You understand. We can't lose it.
And as an example, with one country we have $375 billion in trade deficits. We can't lose. You could make the case that they lost years ago. But when you're down $375 billion, you can't lose. And we have to bring them up.
So there's very bad spirit. When we have a big trade imbalance and we want to bring it up to balance—just balance—and they keep raising it so that you never catch, that's not a good thing to do. And we have very, very strong measures that take care of that, because we do so much—the numbers are so astronomically against them in terms of anything, as per your question. We win that war a thousand times out of a thousand.
Yes. Yes, sir.
North American Free Trade Agreement 
Q. Are you close to a deal on NAFTA? Your Press Secretary said—[inaudible].
The President. So two things can happen on NAFTA. We'll either leave it the way it is, as a threesome deal with Canada and with the United States and Mexico and change it very substantially—we're talking about very big changes. Or we're going to make a deal directly with Canada, directly with Mexico. Both of those things could happen. If a deal isn't made, that would be a very bad thing for Canada, and it would be a very bad thing for Mexico. For the United States, frankly, it would be a good thing. But I'm not looking to do that. I'm not looking to play that game.
So we're either going to have NAFTA in a better negotiated form, or we're going to have two deals.
Q. And does it have to have a sunset clause in it?
The President. It will have a sunset. You have the two sunsets. I mean, you have an ISDS provision and a sunset provision. They've been very heavily negotiated. You have two sunsets, two concepts of sunset. We're pretty close on the sunset division. Okay?
Q. Like 5 years or——
The President. Well, we have one that's 5 years; you know it very well. You've studied this very well. Congratulations. That's right. You have one group that likes to have 5 years, and then a renegotiation at the end of 5 years. And you have another group that wants longer because of the investments. So—but we're pretty close.
Yes, sir.
Russia's Annexation of Crimea 
Q. Mr. President, David Herszenhorn with Politico Europe. Just to come back to Russia for a second. The ""something that happened"" that got them kicked out of the G-8 was the invasion and annexation of Crimea. Do you think that Crimea should be recognized as Russian at this point?
The President. Well, you know, you have to ask President Obama, because he was the one that let Crimea get away. That was during his administration. And he was the one that let Russia go and spend a lot of money on Crimea, because they've spent a lot of money on rebuilding it. I guess they have their submarine port there and such. But Crimea was let go during the Obama administration. And you know, Obama can say all he wants, but he allowed Russia to take Crimea. I may have had a much different attitude. But—so you'd really have to ask that question to President Obama—you know, why did he do that; why did he do that? But with that being said, it's been done a long time.
Russia/Group of Seven (G-7) Nations 
Q. But you would allow Russia back into the G-8 with Crimea still——
The President. I would rather see Russia in the G-8 as opposed to the G-7. I would say that the G-8 is a more meaningful group than the G-7, absolutely.
Yes. Yes, ma'am.
Trade/U.S. Economy 
Q. How persuasive did you find the Europeans and Canadians when they made the case to you that you shouldn't use national security as a justification for tariffs?
The President. They virtually didn't even make that case. I mean, my case is the fact that it is national security; it's our balance sheet; it's our strength. It's absolutely national security. And, you know, if you look at our—just take a look at our balance sheet. We're going to have a very strong balance sheet very soon because of what I'm doing. We have the strongest economy that we've ever had in the United States—in the history of the United States. We have the best unemployment numbers: Black unemployment, the lowest in history; Hispanic unemployment, the lowest in history. I don't mean the lowest in the last 10 years or 20 years. The lowest in the history of this country. Black unemployment is doing the best it's ever done. Hispanic doing the best. Women are now up to 21 years. Soon it's going to be the best ever in its history—in the country's history.
We have to have deals that are fair, and we have to have deals that are economic. Otherwise, that does, in fact, affect our military. Okay?
Q. How do you make that case for autos?
The President. Oh, it's very easy. It's economic. It's the balance sheet. To have a great military, you need a great balance sheet. Okay?
Yes, sir. Go ahead.
Group of Seven (G-7) Nations/News Media/U.S. Relations With Allies/Trade 
Q. As you were heading into these G-7 talks, there was a sense that the—America's closest allies were frustrated with you and angry with you and that you were angry with them and that you were leaving here early to go meet for more friendlier talks with Kim Jong Un in Singapore. And I'm wondering if you——
The President. It's well put, I think.
Q. ——if you view it the same way. And do you view the U.S. alliance system shifting under your Presidency, away from——
The President. Who are you with, out of curiosity?
Q. CNN. [Laughter]
The President. I figured. Fake News CNN, the worst. But no, I could tell by the question. I had no idea you were CNN. After the question, I was just curious as to who you were with. You're with CNN.
I would say that the level of relationship is a 10. We have a great relationship. Angela and Emmanuel and Justin. I would say the relationship is a 10. And I don't blame them. I blame—as I said, I blame our past leaders for allowing this to happen. There was no reason this should happen. There's no reason that we should have big trade deficits with virtually every country in the world. I'm going long beyond the G-7. There's no reason for this. It's the fault of the people that preceded me. And I'm not just saying President Obama. I'm going back a long way. You can go back 50 years, frankly. It just got worse and worse and worse.
You know, we used to be a nation that was unbelievably cashflow oriented, had no debt of any consequence, and that built the highway system. We built the interstate system out of—virtually out of cashflow. And it was a lot different.
No, we have a very good relationship, and I don't blame these people, but I will blame them if they don't act smart and do what they have to do—because they have no choice. I'll be honest with you, they have no choice.
They're either going to make the trades fair, because our farmers have been hurt. You look at our farmers. For 15 years, the graph is going just like this, down. Our farmers have been hurt, our workers have been hurt. Our companies have moved out and moved to Mexico and other countries, including Canada.
Now, we are going to fix that situation. And if it's not fixed, we're not going to deal with these countries. But the relationship that I've had is great. So you can tell that to your fake friends at CNN.
The relationship that I've had with the people, the leaders of these countries, has been—I would really, rate it—on a scale of 0 to 10, I would rate it a 10. That doesn't mean I agree with what they're doing. And they know very well that I don't. So we're negotiating very hard, tariffs and barriers.
As an example, the European Union is brutal to the United States. They don't take—and they understand that. They know it. When I'm telling them, they're smiling at me. You know, it's like they—the gig is up. It's like the gig is up. They're not trying to—there's nothing they can say. They can't believe they got away with it. Canada can't believe it got away with it. Mexico—we have $100 billion trade deficit with Mexico, and that doesn't include all the drugs that are pouring in because we have no wall. But we are. We started building the wall, as you know. $1.6 billion—and we're going to keep that going.
But a lot of these countries actually smile at me when I'm talking. And the smile is—we couldn't believe we got away with it. That's the smile. So it's going to change. It's going to change. They have no choice. If it's not going to change, we're not going to trade with them.
Okay, how about a couple of more? Go ahead in the back.
North Korea 
Q. Thanks, Mr. President. Eliana Johnson with Politico.
The President. Yes. Hi.
Q. Going into these talks with Kim Jong Un, do you have a clear objective of what you want to get out of them?
The President. I have a clear objective. But I have to say, Eliana, that it's going to be something that will always be spur of the moment. You don't know. You know, this has not been done before at this level. This is a leader who really is an unknown personality. People don't know much about him. I think that he's going to surprise on the upside, very much on the upside. We'll see. But never been done. Never been tested. Many people—world leaders—I'm talking about world leaders that have been right next to him have never met him.
So we're going in with a very positive spirit, I think, very well prepared. I think—and by the way, we have worked very well with their people. They have many people right now in Shanghai; our people have been—in Singapore. Our people have been working very, very well with the representatives of North Korea.
So we're going in with a very positive attitude, and I think we're going to come out fine. But I've said it many times: Who knows? Who knows? May not. May not work out. It's a good chance it won't work out. There's probably an even better chance that it will take a period of time. It will be a process.
North Korea 
Q. Is there a particular outcome that you would look for from this initial talk to judge whether you think things are going well? The President. Well, I think the minimum would be relationship. You'd start at least a dialogue. Because, you know, as a deal person, I've done very well with deals. What you want to do is start that. Now, I'd like to accomplish more than that. But at a minimum, I do believe, at least, we'll have met each other. We will have seen each other. Hopefully, we will have liked each other, and we'll start that process.
So I would say that would be the minimal. And the maximum, I think you know the answer to that. But I think that will take a little bit of time.
Okay? Yes.
North Korea 
Q. How long do you think that it will take you to figure out whether he's serious about giving up his—[inaudible]?
The President. That's a good question. How long will it take? I think within the first minute I'll know.
Q. How?
The President. Just my touch, my feel. That's what I do. How long will it take to figure out whether or not they're serious? I said maybe in the first minute. You know, the way—they say that you know if you're going to like somebody in the first 5 seconds. You ever hear that one? Well, I think that very quickly I'll know whether or not something good is going to happen.
I also think I'll know whether or not it will happen fast. It may not. But I think I'll know pretty quickly whether or not, in my opinion, something positive will happen.
Q. Are you——
The President. And if I think it won't happen, I'm not going to waste my time. I don't want to waste his time.
Yes, ma'am.
North Korea 
Q. Are you concerned about all that just like giving Kim the meeting, that he's getting a win as a deal—[inaudible]?
The President. No, no, no, no. That's only—only the fake news says that. You know, this—look, we just three hostages back. We paid nothing. They came back. They're happily in ensconced in their homes with their families. They're the happiest people in the world right now.
We have gotten—you know, we haven't done anything. Everyone said—you know, the haters, they say, ""Oh, you're giving him a meeting, you're""—give me a break, okay? There's nothing. I think if I didn't do this, it would be—and it's never been done before, you know. It's never been done before. And obviously, what has been done before hasn't worked.
And this is something—I can't stress this strong enough. You know, I talked about tariffs that previous people—and I'm not looking to criticize people that were preceding me—but on tariffs, it should have never happened.
Well, the same thing on North Korea. We shouldn't be in this position. We shouldn't be in this position on tariffs, where we're hundreds of billions of dollars down to other countries that, frankly, were never even negotiated with. They never even got spoken to. I asked a top person in China, how did it get so bad? He looked at me, he said, ""Nobody ever talked to us."" They were missing in action, our leaders.
Well, a very similar thing, if you think about it, took place with North Korea. This should not be done now. This should have been done 5 years ago and 10 years ago and 25 years ago. It shouldn't be done now.
North Korea 
Q. Have you spoken to Kim at all in the last——
The President. I can't comment on that.
Director Kudlow Sir, you've got a plane to catch, Mr. President.
The President. Okay, one more question.
Q. A follow-up on North Korea, will you raise of the gulags with Kim Jong Un and——
The President. We're going to raise every issue.
Q. ——and the—[inaudible]—and kidnappings?
The President. Every issue is going to be raised.
News Media 
Q. Mr. President, we're sitting here in Canada; you've attacked the U.S. press back home, but you've also done it now on foreign soil. I guess I want—I'd like to ask you why you do that. And do you think——
The President. Because the U.S. press is very dishonest, much of it. Not all of it. Oh, I have some folks in your profession that are with the U.S., in the U.S.—citizens, proud citizens; they're reporters. These are some of the most outstanding people I know. But there are many people in the press that are unbelievably dishonest. They don't cover stories the way they're supposed to be. They don't even report them, in many cases, if they're positive.
So there's tremendous—you know, I came up with the term, ""fake news."" It's a lot of fake news. But at the same time, I have great respect for many people in the press.
Thank you all very much. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you."
"September 18, 2018",The President's News Conference With President Andrzej Duda of Poland,Donald J. Trump,"Donald J. Trump, The President's News Conference With President Andrzej Duda of Poland Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/332681",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-andrzej-duda-poland,"President Trump. Thank you very much. Please, sit down. Today I'm very honored to host the President of Poland, a friend of mine, President Duda, and Mrs. Duda. Thank you very much for being here. Great honor.
It's lovely to have you at the White House. We spent some time in the Oval Office, and we accomplished a lot. Melania and I are deeply grateful for the incredible welcome the President and Mrs. Duda gave us in Warsaw, Poland, last year. It was a very exceptional day. Extraordinary. It's wonderful to have them both with us in Washington today. Thank you very much, Mr. President.
During my visit last summer, I had the privilege to stand before the monument to the Warsaw Uprising and address the people of Poland about our shared commitment to defending our heritage and our civilization. It was an experience I will always treasure and I will never, ever forget.
Not far from where we stand today, another monument in another square—the statue of General Kosciuszko in Lafayette Park—reminds us that the bonds between our people go all the way back to America's Revolutionary War.
This year, the United States and Poland are celebrating 100 years of Poland regaining its independence and nearly 100 years of U.S.-Polish diplomatic ties. It's a long time. I'm thrilled to say that the alliance between our nations has never been stronger with you and I at the helm. Do you agree with that?
President Duda. Yes.
President Trump. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm glad he said yes. [Laughter]
President Duda. Yes!
President Trump. In our discussions this afternoon, President Duda and I agreed to bolster our robust defense ties. We will enhance cooperation in military relations, intelligence, missile defense, technology, and training.
I'm proud to report that Poland has recently purchased a state-of-the-art Patriot missile system, which is a great system. We make the greatest military equipment by far, anywhere in the world. And it's made right here in the USA.
We are grateful for Poland's leadership on defense spending and burden-sharing in NATO. I want to commend Poland for meeting its NATO defense-spending obligations, and I am glad that it plans to increase spending beyond the 2 percent minimum obligation. Thank you very much for that.
I'd like to share my gratitude to the people of Poland for their contributions to NATO's Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan and the coalition to defeat ISIS. We've made tremendous progress with respect to the defeat of ISIS, as you've seen.
We also understand that you can't have national security without border security. Both Poland and the United States understand that strong nations must have very strong borders. The President and I likewise are exploring opportunities to advance energy security. The United States and Poland are deeply committed to energy diversity all across Europe. No nation should be dependent upon a single foreign supplier of energy.
Poland has worked tirelessly to increase energy independence nationally and across Central Europe. It is constructing a new pipeline—the highest technology—from Norway to Poland, and it recently built a liquefied natural gas import facility. Last year, the United States was proud to send its first export of LNG to Poland, and soon, our nations will launch a high-level diplomatic exchange on energy security. And, Mr. President, we are now, as of a few months ago, the largest producer of energy in the world. So that was—that's a big statement.
President Duda, I also just want to talk to you about the Three Seas Summit, where central European leaders were working hard to increase energy market access, reduce energy trade barriers—which is something we have to get done with respect to the European Union; the trade barriers, they make it very difficult for the United States—and to strengthen energy independence. The United States firmly supports these goals, and we are eager to expand commercial ties all across the region of Europe.
In our meeting today, the President and I discussed our bilateral economic relationship at length. Poland has experienced more than a quarter of century of uninterrupted economic growth, which is a very big statement; very few can say that. And we look forward to further enhancing trade, investment, and commerce between our two great nations.
My administration is committed to realizing a future of prosperity and opportunity for all Americans. This month, we celebrated the highest employment level in U.S. history. We are right now employing more people. We have more workers in the United States than at any time ever in U.S. history. I look forward to partnering with President Duda as we grow our economies together.
Mr. President, thank you for joining me today. Poland has chosen its place among the free and independent nations of the world and as a loyal ally and strategic partner of the United States. And we greatly appreciate that.
We welcome the next 100 years of friendship between our two nations. Mr. President, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
President Duda. Your Excellency, distinguished Mr. President, and distinguished ladies and gentlemen: I am delighted that in this year so important to Poland—the year of Poland regaining its independence, we celebrate our 100th anniversary of it—I'm able to be hosted here, that I'm at the seat of the President of the United States at the White House, at Washington.
And also, from this perspective, from the perspective of the centennial of Poland regaining its independence, this fact is of huge important for Poles, both those living in Poland and those living abroad, especially the 10 million Poles living in the United States. This is of huge, symbolic importance.
One reason for that is that the matter of Polish independence was one of the important points of the policy of the U.S. President Wilson. It was precisely President Wilson, before 1918, he was the one who put Polish independence on his agenda—on the agenda of his policy. That happened among others, thanks to a great Polish politician, a composer and musician, Ignacy Jan Paderewski.
But it is a fact that Poles experienced back then a lot of good from the United States and from the President of the United States. Because there are no other words to describe the fact that that great state indicated to Poland and defined Poland as the country who should be reinstated back on the map of Europe and on the map of the world. And it was reinstated on that map, 100 years ago, in 1918.
And I'm absolutely delighted that today, as Polish President, I can be here at Washington, sit at the same table with the President of the United States, and sign an agreement which is deepening our strategic partnership and which is renewing that strategic partnership.
I'm talking here about the agreement on the strategic partnership. Such an agreement was signed in 2008 between our two countries. Back then, it was signed by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs. And today this renewed version—the version which has been updated because a lot has changed over the 10 years—this renewed version of the strategic partnership was signed personally by myself and President Donald Trump. And I would like to express my deep gratitude to you, Mr. President, for that fact.
This agreement indicates the most important aspects of our cooperation and our friendship. It also sets new paths for the future: the paths of tightening our defense cooperation and military cooperation; tightening our cooperation in the area of security and energy business; tightening our cooperation in the broadly understood sphere of business. Also, in the aspect of the already mentioned cooperation as part of the Three Seas Initiative to which Mr. President has just alluded.
I came here to Washington right from the summit of the Three Seas Initiative, the first business forum organized as part of the Three Seas Initiative. The United States was present there as the partner of the Three Seas. And thank you, Mr. President, for that. Thank you for posting your representatives to that meeting.
And all the leaders who held their speeches there said in a very clear way about the need and hope for cooperation with the United States of America regarding the renewal and building of a new infrastructure, road infrastructure, railway infrastructure, energy infrastructure, both concerning electricity and the transmission of gas in Central Europe along the north-south axis. I'm referring here to the area between the Baltic States, though Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, all the way down to the Black Sea, and then through Croatia and Slovenia to the Adriatic Sea.
This is the space in which we want to cooperate. This is the space in which we want to develop. Our cooperation with the United States is of keen importance in this respect.
Also, as far as providing energy security is concerned, today we talked at length about this with Mr. President. We also discussed threats to energy security in Europe, to the possible diversification of supplies. Without any doubt, such a huge—the biggest threat right now is posed by the construction of Nord Stream II gas pipeline. We discussed at length about this with Mr. President. I presented him the situation as it is.
Unfortunately, we have to be clear and say that, both from the German side and from the Russian side, this construction has already been started. There is still some formalities going on connected with the laying of the pipes at the bottom of the Baltic Sea. However, this investment, without any doubt, threatens energy stability of Europe. And without any doubt, it also threatens Polish energy security, because it is a threat. There is a threat of Russian energy domination, especially when Russia mentions that it's going to build more pipelines: Nord Stream III, Nord Stream IV.
This threat of absolute Russian domination in Europe, in terms of gas deliveries, is obvious. What are the results of such a domination, ladies and gentlemen? We were able to see that ourselves a couple of years ago in Ukraine. A sudden interruption of supplies. Of course, it had nothing to do with economic factors. It was connected only and exclusively with a political blackmail. It was a fact.
And it is obvious that today we are making efforts and we are going to go to any lengths to protect ourselves from that. That is why we decided to construct an LNG terminal. That is why we also decided to receive the LNG gas from the United States.
I'm really glad that we have concluded such contracts. I'm glad that American companies are right now delivering LNG to Poland. And this precisely is a very important element of diversification of gas supplies to our country. And I firmly believe that, thanks to the LNG gas terminal, thanks to expanding its capacities as far as the annual quantities of gas are concerned, we are not only going to realize and safeguard our own energy needs, but I also hope that we'll be able to transmit gas further to our neighbors through the development of the Three Seas Initiative area through the construction of interconnectors.
These issues were all raised by us today during our talks with Mr. President.
And last but not least, opening up to business: We would like to invite American business to Poland. There are better and better investment possibilities. Poland is experiencing a very dynamic growth. Of course, there are companies from the United States which have been present in the Polish market for many, many years, like General Electric, which right now is implementing a huge investment concerning energy sector in Poland—conventional energy—such as construction of the Ostrołęka to Poland that is a huge contract amounting to almost $2 billion.
These are the huge projects which are all being realized in Poland. But I want to invite to Poland all businesspeople, those who have got huge economic projects here and who have got huge possibilities of investment. But we would also like to invite the smaller ones. Poland is a big European country. I believe it is an interesting partner where the United States and the U.S. business is very much welcome. And I want to assure you, ladies and gentlemen, about that.
There is also a perspective of developing your activity through Poland to include the Three Seas countries. And this is something that we have been working on as a part of the Three Seas Initiative. We want to ensure, also, the communication possibilities, and we also want to increase the opportunities for economic cooperation.
We want, also, business partners from the U.S. to join our projects. There are going to be a lot of communication, traffic-related investments in our part of Europe. We would like invite American businesses to come, because I believe that this opens up an opportunity for making joint business.
And, ladies and gentlemen, all of that is connected, of course, with the issue of military security. I'm hugely delighted with the presence of U.S. Armed Forces in the Polish territory. I'm deeply satisfied with the decisions that were taken by Warsaw NATO summit in 2016, where the presence of the military forces of NATO in Poland was guaranteed. I'm also happy that we have, in Poland, American soldiers as part of our bilateral agreements. But I would like to invite you, Mr. President, to post more American troops to Poland. We believe that the presence of the United States is a guarantor of security in our part of Europe.
We, ourselves, want to invest further. We want to modernize Polish Armed Forces. Mr. President Trump mentioned the so-called Wisła air defense system. That includes the purchase of Patriot missiles. We are implementing the largest military investment so far, as far as the Polish Armed Forces are concerned, over the last 30 years.
We want to implement more projects. We want to buy more equipment. We also want to cooperate in the area of research and development as regards military technology. And I'm convinced that this cooperation between Poland and the United States will go on smoothly. I hope that Mr. President will make a decision to deploy to Poland more U.S. units, together with equipment.
Ladies and gentlemen, I was smiling when talking to Mr. President. I said that I would very much like for us to set up a—permanent American bases in Poland, which we would call Fort Trump. And I firmly believe that this is possible. I am convinced that such a decision lies both in the Polish interest as well as in the interest of the United States.
Poland is an attractive country an attractive country. And first and foremost, it's got a very important strategic location in Europe. And I'm convinced that, for the interest of the United States, also pertaining to the security of the United States itself, the presence of the U.S. Armed Forces in our country is important also to protect American interests.
Mr. President, once again, thank you very much for this meeting. Thank you, once again, for this joint declaration that we're able to sign today. Thank you for also adding this new splendor to the centennial of Poland regaining its independence and also to the 10th anniversary of our strategic partnership.
President Trump. Thank you. A tremendous amount of LNG will be exported to Poland. We're giving them a pretty good price, but they're buying a lot of it, and that's going to be great.
Hurricane Florence Preparedness Efforts 
I do want to say that, while we're together, tremendous effort and bravery is being shown in North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and the area that was so horribly hit by Hurricane Florence. I just got some clips of some of the things that the Coast Guard is doing and getting people to safety in horrible, horrible conditions.
And I want to just salute all of the people that are working so hard: the first responders, law enforcement, the military, FEMA. The job they're doing is incredible. It's incredible. So I just want to thank them very much.
And I think what we'll do is we'll take our first question from Emerald Robinson of One America News. Emerald?
Russia/Syria 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. So news today of a plane—a Russian plane—shot down over Syria. Russia is assigning the blame to Israel, even though it was accidentally shot down by Syrian forces.
Clearly, things are heating up. There's concerns by many Americans—most Americans—that we might be involved in a war in Syria soon. You had hoped to bring troops home, but clearly, things are changing. What do you tell American people today about a possibility of war in Syria?
President Trump. Well, I just heard about the incident you have mentioned, Emerald, and it sounds to me and it seems to me, just like based on a review of the facts, that Syria shot down a Russian plane. And I understand about 14 people were killed, at least. And that's a very sad thing. But that's what happens. But Syria—according to early reports; that's subject to change—but that Syria shot down a Russian plane. So that's not a good situation.
We have done a tremendous job in Syria and in that region eradicating ISIS, which is why we're there. And we're very close to being finished with that job, and then we're going to make a determination as to what we're going to do. But we have eradicated ISIS in a very large area of the Middle East. These are people that will not be coming here, because they're not around any longer. So we've done in a very short period of time.
Our Vice President is here, Mike Pence. Our great Secretary of State—really, thank you very much for the great job you're doing—Mike Pompeo. And we've been working very hard on this. And they've done an incredible job over there, but we'll make a decision fairly quickly.
Thank you very much. Would you have a question for the President?
Potential U.S. Military Base in Poland/North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Q. Certainly. Thank you, President Duda. Clearly, you said you asked President Trump if he would consider a permanent base in Poland, and of course, that also relates to Russia. What would you say—how did the President respond to your position to have a permanent base from America in Poland?
And then, also, do you currently have concerns over the U.S.-Russia relationship?
President Duda. Well, of course. Of course, I told Mr. President about all the aspects connected with the permanent presence of the U.S. Armed Forces in Poland. But, first and foremost, I assured Mr. President of one thing. First and foremost, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot say that, if there are permanent bases of the U.S. Armed Forces in Poland, we will see a deterioration of security because that will lead to an increase in Russian activity and increased militarization of this part of Europe by Russia.
I want to say it clearly, ladies and gentlemen: A very strong militarization of, for instance, Kaliningrad Oblast has taken place for more than 10 years now. It is the reality that we're living today. As far aggressive Russian behavior is concerned, as far as increased military activities concerned, including increasing of the militarization, Russia has been conducting such activities in a systematic way. And for the first time, we were able to see that in a materialized way in Georgia. In 2008, when the then-President of Poland, Professor Lech Kaczynski, took other European leaders, and they went to Tbilisi to stop Russian tanks, which were about to attack the capital of Georgia. And from that moment, that military expansion has been developing.
It's another leg was the attack on Ukraine. And today we can see an illegal annexation of Crimea. Today, we are witnessing constant violation of international law in the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts. So these are today political and military facts of Europe, and the presence of the United States is only providing a guarantee of security and a possibility to defend.
Because let me reiterate again: It is only about the guarantee of security and defense of our part of Europe that is the free world. This is the most crucial issue right now from our perspective, from the perspective of Central and Eastern European countries. And we are speaking in one voice on this one, generally.
That is why we wanted to ensure the presence of the United States Armed Forces, and also, we wanted to have the presence of NATO forces in our part of Europe as well. And of course, Mr. President and his staff, his advisers, and also the Pentagon staff, have to consider all these issues, but there is a whole range of arguments which are in favor of the fact that the presence of the U.S. Armed Forces in this area is absolutely justified today. That is due to the protection of the interests of the United States as well.
So I'm absolutely convinced of this one, because today, unfortunately, we are seeing international law being violated. Today, we are seeing aggressive behaviors, and I am convinced that there is no more effective method of preventing a war than a decisive stance demonstrating that we are ready any moment to repel a possible attack. And presence also means deterrence. At the same time, I am convinced that when we are—when we have a strong military presence in this part of Europe where there is a potential threat, then there will be no war happening ever.
President Trump. And I think it should be pointed out that the President also said, and he also said it publicly, that he would pay the United States—meaning Poland would be paying billions of dollars for a base. And we're looking at that more and more from the standpoint of defending really wealthy countries and not being reimbursed, paid.
It's one thing when we defend countries that can't defend themselves and their great people. And we should help them; we don't expect anything for that. But when we're defending immensely wealthy countries and they're not paying for the defense to the United States, they're only taking advantage of us. And we are in discussions with numerous countries, all of whom you know, about payment. Payment. And we get along with them very well, but it's not fair. That includes NATO.
As you know, I got $44 billion additional last year, where they paid an additional—you can speak to Secretary General Stoltenberg, who is the head of NATO, and he said he's never seen anything like it. And this year we did even better.
But when a country is very wealthy, and when the United States has been protecting them for many years at tremendous cost—cost like nobody in this room would believe—it's time that they help with, we call it burden-sharing. And they will do that.
But the President offered us much more than $2 billion to do this, and so we're looking at it. We're looking at it from the standpoint of, number one, military protection for both countries, and also cost, a term you don't hear too often and you haven't heard too often over the last 25 years. But that's the way it has to be.
Thank you very much. Would you like to have a question, please?
Russia/U.S. Military Strength 
Q. [Inaudible]—Polish Press Agency. I've got a question to President Trump. Do you share the conviction, which we have just heard a minute ago expressed by President Duda, concerning the threat which is posed to the region, but not only to the region, by Russia? And do you also share the view that permanent American bases in Poland are justified not only due to the security of the countries in our region, but also due to the security of the United States?
President Trump. I do. I actually do. I think it's a very aggressive situation. I think Russia has acted aggressively. They respect force. They respect strength, as anyone does. And we have the greatest strength in the world—especially now. We were being depleted under the last administration. We had planes that were old and tired and didn't fly, in some cases. They were getting used parts. This is the United States; it doesn't happen. We make the greatest planes in the world and missiles in the world.
And we have enhanced, to put it mildly, our military. It's literally being rebuilt, as we speak, with literally hundreds and hundreds of planes and missiles, and everything that you can imagine. They never had it so good, because I got, in Congress, $700 billion this year; $716 billion last year. That's far more than they ever anticipated.
I viewed it two ways. Number one, military—because it's always more important than anything else, including jobs. But number two is jobs. We make everything here. So it's hundreds of thousands of jobs to make for us the best military in the world. And Russia respects that. They respect that. So I am with the President. I feel that he's right. And I feel that, look, you look at the history of Poland and Russia, that's a long and very complicated history. So he certainly has a right to feel that way. Okay?
Q. I had a question to President Duda. After the meeting that you have had today at the White House, do you have the feeling that the probability that Polish expectations concerning permanent American presence in our country are closer to being implemented? Are they going to be a fact?
President Duda. Ladies and gentlemen, today, myself and Mr. President had a tête-à-tête meeting, a private meeting, and then we met also with our staff. We had long conversations, very honest discussions, and very strong at certain points, as well, in terms of diagnosis of the situation in the area of military security and energy security alike.
And I am convinced that all of us are going to draw appropriate conclusions from these discussions. Because as I said, both sides presented their positions in many—absolutely many elements. They are concurrent—as far as the assessment of the situation currently is—what kind of steps need to be taken in order to protect both the issue of security and the issue of interests. These are business-related issues.
I am convinced that, ladies and gentlemen, you are going to see the results of both our meetings today and of the declaration that we have signed together with Mr. President. Of course, we are talking about long-term processes, so I'm sure that you are going to see how this is going to be filled with content. And you will see concrete facts that will appear on the maps and also in agreements and in purchases that are going to be realized.
President Trump. Jon Decker of Fox, please.
Supreme Court Nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Two questions for you. One on Judge Kavanaugh and also one on trade. On Judge Kavanaugh, yesterday you said, ""We want to go through a full process."" You said, ""We want to make sure everything is perfect, everything is just right."" To that end, what would be the problem with the FBI reopening their background investigation into Judge Kavanaugh? Would you support such a thing?
President Trump. It wouldn't bother me, other than the FBI, Jon, said that they really don't do that; that's not what they do. Now, they have done, supposedly, six background checks over the years, as Judge Kavanaugh has gone beautifully up a ladder. He's an incredible individual. Great intellect, great judge. Impeccable history in every way—in every way.
I feel so badly for him that he's going through this, to be honest with you. I feel so badly for him. This is not a man that deserves this. This should have been brought to the fore. It should have been brought up long ago. And that's what you have hearings for. You don't wait until the hearing is over and then, all of a sudden, bring it up.
When Senator Feinstein sat with Judge Kavanaugh for a long period of time—a long, long meeting—she had this letter. Why didn't she bring it up? Why didn't she bring it up then? Why didn't the Democrats bring it up then? Because they obstruct and because they resist. That's the name of their campaign against me. They just resist, and they just obstruct. And frankly, I think they're lousy on policy, and in many ways, they're lousy politicians. But they're very good on obstruction. And it's a shame, because this is a great gentleman.
With all of that, I feel that the Republicans—and I can speak for myself—we should go through a process, because there shouldn't even be a little doubt. There shouldn't be a doubt. Again, they knew what they were doing. They should have done this a long time ago—3 months ago—not now. But they did it now. So I don't want to play into their hands.
Hopefully, the woman will come forward, state her case. He will state his case before representatives of the United States Senate. And then, they will vote. They will look at his career. They will look at what she had to say from 36 years ago. And we will see what happens.
But I just think he is at a level that we rarely see not only in government, anywhere in life. And honestly, I feel terribly for him, for his wife, who is an incredible, lovely woman, and for his beautiful young daughters. I feel terribly for them.
U.S. Trade Negotiations With China, Mexico, Canada, and the European Union 
Q. On trade, Mr. President, you announced new trade tariffs against China. Trade tariffs are a very important part of your economic and trade policy. In you first year in office, the U.S. trade deficit increased by 12 percent. And last month, we saw the trade deficit increase to, I believe it was, $72 billion. So my question to you is, is your trade tariffs policy working?
President Trump. Well, we just started. We didn't do anything with respect to China because we wanted to have the benefit of China having to do with North Korea. And they have been helpful. I hope they're still helpful; there's a question about that. But it got to a point where the numbers were too big. This should have been done for the last 20 years.
If you look at the WTO, the World Trade Organization, that's when China really happened, economically. That's—it was like a rocket ship, because they took advantage of the rules of the WTO.
And whoever was standing at this podium in this incredible ","White House, in the Oval Office, they should have done something about this long ago.
Over the last number of years, China has taken out of this country $500 billion and more—a year. $500 billion. That would go a long way for Poland, wouldn't it? You could rebuild your whole country. And that's what China did. They rebuilt their country with tremendous amounts of money pouring out of the United States. And I've changed that around. And if you look at what's going on, our market is going up like a rocket ship. I don't want their market to go down, but their market is down 32 percent in 3 months. Because we can't let them do anymore what they've done.
And I watch trade deficits, because to me, deficits are very important. They're not everything, and they're not exact. Sometimes, you can have, you know, a deficit, and that's not such a bad thing. But when you have $375 billion in trade deficits and then many billions of dollars in other liabilities of all different types, you have to do something about it.
We are the piggybank to the world. We have been ripped off by China. We've been ripped off by—excuse me, Mr. President—the European Union, of which you're a part of. [Laughter] We've been ripped off by everybody. And I want to protect the American worker, the American farmer, the ranchers, the companies. And we're not being ripped off, you will see, in a little while.
Speaking of that, we've come to a conclusion with Mexico. We have a wonderful deal for both parties. It was a very one-sided deal. Now it's a good deal for both parties. Very happy with it.
The new President had conversation and it was terrific. I think we're going to have a very good relationship. We'll see. We'll see. We want help on the border because we have the worst immigration laws in the history of mankind or womankind. We have horrible, horrible immigration laws, so we want help. But we've come to a conclusion with Mexico. Canada has taken advantage of our country for a long time. We love Canada. We love it. Love the people of Canada. But they are in a position that's not a good position for Canada. They cannot continue to charge us 300-percent tariff on dairy products, and that's what they're doing.
So this is a process. It takes a little time. The European Union wouldn't talk to us. They wouldn't talk to President Obama. Wouldn't even talk to him. And then I said, ""That's okay, you don't have to talk to me."" Jean-Claude is a tough man. He's a very good man. I like him, but he's tough. He's nasty. [Laughter] The kind of guy I want negotiating for me. But he's a tough, tough cookie. And I said to him, ""We have to renegotiate the deal."" He said: ""But, Mr. President, we are very happy with the deal. We don't want to negotiate."" I said, ""You may be happy with the deal, but I'm not happy with the deal.
And he didn't want to renegotiate. And after three times, he still didn't want to renegotiate. I said, ""That's okay, we don't have to renegotiate any longer. We're going to put a tariff on all of the millions of cars you send into the United States."" And honestly, he was in my office so quickly, from Europe, that I didn't know they had airplanes that flew that fast. [Laughter] I said, ""Where did you find this plane?"" [Laughter]
And we have the semblance of a deal. Because it's, to a large extent, economically all about cars. Cars are a very big factor. And they send millions of BMWs and Mercedes into our country.
So we are working on trade very hard. It's very important to me. It has been for 30 years. I've been saying for 30 years. It started with Japan. I talked about Japan; I was right. I talked about China; I was right. It's what I do. And I like doing it. But I like doing it for the people because our country has been abused and taken advantage of by virtually every country that it does business with. And we're just not letting that happen anymore. And that includes what I said previously about the military.
Please.
South Korea-U.S. Trade 
Q. President Duda, welcome back to the U.S. As it relates to U.S.-EU relations, as the President mentioned, you are a proud—Poland is a proud member of the European Union. How would you describe U.S.-EU relations right now? Did you talk about improving that relationship? Did you carry a special message to the President from Mr. Juncker?
President Duda. Sir, I would be very happy if it was Poland which would disrupt the trade balance of the United States. I really would be happy if that was the case. Because my understanding, as far as politics is concerned, and carrying for the matters of your country is similar to the view of Mr. President Trump. Mr. Trump is saying ""America first,"" and I'm saying, ""Poland first."" So we understand each other very well.
And it is hard for me to be surprised with the fact that Mr. President being a very experienced man—a man of success, as far as business is concerned—knows how to calculate. He knows how to calculate, and I think nobody puts that into question either in the U.S. or in another place. And he takes care of the United States. It lies in the interest of the country to have a balanced trade exchange, and this is something that you have to take care of. And of course, there is a clash of interest. However, objectively looking, it is hard not to understand it.
So there is always competition of interest. There is—every kind of business is a competition of interests. And I represent Polish interests, whereas President Trump represents American interests. The whole thing is as follows: On important matters, you have to strike an agreement to make sure that both countries wins and lose as little as possible. And then, we have an understanding, an agreement. And then, we can say that we are cooperating with each other on equal level. And I believe this is the kind of cooperation that Mr. President would like to have with the European Union. And it is—it will be hard to be surprised with that.
I'm listening kindly to that, and I would like Poland to be such a country, such an economic superpower, that it would be a very important partner to the United States. I said jokingly, in the beginning, that I wish it was Poland which disturbed the trade balance of the United States and our exports to the United States, but I do believe that our cooperation is going to develop well on partners, like principles.
President Trump. The trade deal with South Korea has been fully renegotiated and is ready for signature. We may sign it at the United Nations or shortly thereafter. That was a terrible deal for the United States. Now it's a fair deal. But that's been fully renegotiated, in addition to Mexico and some of the others that are very close.
Thank you very much, everybody. We appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President."
"September 26, 2018",The President's News Conference in New York City,Donald J. Trump,"Donald J. Trump, The President's News Conference in New York City Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/332706",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-new-york-city-0,"The President. Thank you very much, everybody. We've had a great 3 days at the United Nations in New York. And this is quite a gathering. Wow. It's a lot of people, a lot of media. [Laughter]
We've covered a great deal of territory. Just left, as you know, Prime Minister Abe of Japan. We're starting trade talks with Japan. They were not willing, for years, to talk trade, and now they're willing to talk trade. And I'm sure we'll make a very good deal.
Just concluded, as you know—2 days ago, signed a deal with South Korea—a trade deal, a tremendous deal with South Korea. It means a lot of business for our farmers. We're opening up for farmers. We're opening up for a lot of different groups.
We're going to be able to sell much more than double the number of automobiles that we were allowed under a deal that was totally defective that was there before. And so we're very happy with that. That deal is actually concluded.
We're very well along the way with Mexico. The relationship is very good. And with Canada, we'll see what happens. They're charging us 300-percent tariffs on dairy products. We can't have that. We can't have that.
With China, as you know, we put out an announcement today. They would like to see me lose an election, because they've never been challenged like this. But I want to open up China to our farmers and to our industrialists and our companies. And China is not open, but we're open to them. They charge us 25, 35, 55 percent for things, and we charge them nothing in terms of coming into the country. Cars, they're at 25 percent. And we're at 2 percent and 2½ percent and don't even collect it. But we collect it now.
So we're doing very well in our situation with China on trade. I have a great relationship with the President of China, President Xi. But it's got to be a two-way street. It—for 25 years and longer, it was not. And trillions and trillions of dollars was taken out of the United States for the benefit of China. We just can't have that. We have to make it fair.
So we're at $250 billion now at 25-percent interest. And a lot of money is coming into our coffers. And it's had no impact on our—absolutely, by the way—no impact on our economy, which I said it wouldn't.
In fact, steel is like the hottest industry there is. If you look at what happened with steel, we're charging a 25-percent tariff for the dumpers. They dump massive amounts of steel. They want to put the steel companies out of business. And after they're out of business, they'll come in and charge five times more than you ever thought possible. And we need steel, and we need aluminum. And those industries are doing well.
But steel is incredible. U.S. Steel is opening up a minimum of eight plants. Nucor is opening up plants. And these are big plants—$750-million and a billion-dollar plants, in some cases.
So what's happening with the steel industry is very exciting to me. It's being rebuilt overnight. If you look at the miners in coal, if you look at energy, LNG—Japan just gave us some numbers that are incredible. They're doubling the amount that they are going to be buying for Japan. They're taking the LNG, and they're doubling it up.
I said: ""You have to do me a favor. We don't want these big deficits. You're going to have to buy more."" They're buying massive amounts of equipment and military equipment, and other countries are doing the same thing. Because we have trade imbalances with almost everybody. It's a rare exception that we don't.
So we are doing great as a country. Unfortunately, they just raised interest rates a little bit, because we are doing so well. I'm not happy about that, because I know it's going to be a question. I am not happy about that. I'd rather pay down debt or do other things, create more jobs. So I'm worried about the fact that they seem to like raising interest rates. We can do other things with the money. And—but they raised them. And they're raising them because we're doing so well. You know, we're doing much better than I had projected in terms of—when I was campaigning, I said we were going to do this, and we're doing much better than anybody ever thought possible.
And I will say, if others got in, it would have been just the opposite, because they were going to put restrictions on. They were going to put regulations on. They were going to choke the economy as it was already choking, but it would have been worse. And they were going to raise your taxes. That's what they want to do now if they ever got control, which I don't think they'll have control for a long time.
So with that being said, we'll take some questions and—yes, please. John [John Roberts, Fox News], go ahead. We have plenty of time.
Senate Confirmation Hearings for Supreme Court Nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh 
Q. Mr. President, thank you very much. Of course, what you're looking forward to tomorrow is the hearings with Judge Kavanaugh——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——before the Judiciary Committee. In 1991, when Joe Biden passed along to the Bush 41 White House the allegations that Anita Hill had raised against Clarence Thomas, the Bush White House asked the FBI to look into it as part of Judge Thomas's background investigation—not a criminal investigation, but the background investigation.
The President. Right. Right.
Q. When these allegations were raised, why didn't this White House do the same thing? And with all of the allegations that are coming out now about Judge Kavanaugh, was there an opportunity missed here to have investigators look into this and get some sort of clarity one way or the other?
The President. Well, the FBI told us they've investigated Judge Kavanaugh six times, five times, many times over the years. They know him very well. But here, there was nothing to investigate from at least one standpoint. They didn't know the location. They didn't know the time. They didn't know the year. They didn't know anything. And it's like, where do you go?
Also, it's not for the FBI. If you look at what Joe Biden said, he said, ""They don't do this."" And he said it very clearly. So I think when you really look at it all, it's not going to change any of the Democrats' minds. They're obstructionists. They're actually con artists, because they know how quality this man is, and they've destroyed a man's reputation and they want to destroy it even more.
And I think people are going to see that in the midterms. What they've done to this family, what they've done to these children—these beautiful children of his—and what they've done to his wife. And they know it's a big, fat con job. And they go into a room, and I guarantee you, they laugh like hell at what they've pulled off on you and on the public. They laugh like hell.
So, it wouldn't have mattered if the FBI came back with the cleanest score. And you understand that very well, John. If they would have come back with the most perfect—""We found everything, and he's perfectly innocent of everything."" It wouldn't have made a difference. You wouldn't have gotten one vote.
Now we will get votes from the Democrats if we win. You'll have three, four, or five Democrats giving us votes, because they're in States that I won by 30 and 40 points, and they're going to give us votes. But other than that, you probably won't get any, John.
Yes, go ahead. Please.
Senate Confirmation Hearings for Supreme Court Nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh 
Q. Mr. President, there are now three women accusing Judge Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. Are you saying that all three of those women are liars? Is there anything that can be said at this point tomorrow——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——that could cause you to withdraw the nomination? Anything at all that——
The President. I won't get into that game. I'll only tell you this: This is one of the highest quality people that I've ever met, and everybody that knows him says the same thing. And these are all false—to me, these are false accusations in certain cases. And certain cases, even the media agrees with that.
I can only say that, what they've done to this man is incredible. You know, it's very interesting, I pick a lot of judges. I have 145 judges I will be picking by the end of a fairly short period of time because President Obama wasn't big on picking judges. When I got there, I said, ""How is this possible?"" I have 145—including Court of Appeals—judges. And they just didn't do it. You know why? They got tired. They got complacent. Something happened. I have 145 judges.
Everybody wants to be a Federal judge. Not just a Supreme Court judge, I'm talking about Court of Appeals; I'm talking about District Court. I don't think they're going to want to so much. I'll be calling people, and we'll have people calling people that do this. And people are going to be scared because we could say it about you, ""Thirty-five years ago, you met someone . . .""—and you might know—you might not know what's going on.
What is going on? Why did they wait so long? Why did Senator Feinstein wait until the hearings were over and make this case? Why didn't she bring it right at the beginning? When you ask about, as an example, the FBI, why didn't they bring this right at the beginning, during the hearing? You would have had all the time in the world for the FBI. It would have been fine. Now the FBI, as you know, did investigate this time, as they have five or six other times. And they did a very thorough investigation. But this is a big con job. And I would love to be in the room with the Democrats, close the door—you guys are all away, outside, waiting—and Schumer and his buddies are all in there laughing how they fooled you all. Let's just stop them. A big fat con.
Yeah, go ahead.
Sexual Assault Allegations Against Supreme Court Nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh 
Q. But, Mr. President, if I could follow up. You have daughters. Can you understand why a victim of sexual assault would not report it at the time? Don't you understand——
The President. By the way, I only say this: 36 years, no charge, no nothing. Everybody——
Q. But that happens often. I mean——
The President. People are going to have to make a decision. Thirty-six years, there's no charge. All of a sudden, the hearings are over, and the rumors start coming out.
And then you have this other con artist, Avenatti, come out with another beauty today. I only say that you have to look at the facts. The Senators are very capable people. They're very good people. I know many of them. They're friends of mine. These are very talented, very good people. And they're going to vote. They're going to believe what they believe.
I can—when I look at what's happened to the reputation of a great gentleman—a great intellect; a brilliant man; somebody that has a chance to be one of our great Supreme Court Justices in history, intellectually—I think it's a shame.
Yes, please.
Q. Yes, Mr. President. My name is Tomás Regalado from Radio and TV Marti.
The President. Okay.
Cuba/Venezuela 
Q. Mr. President, yesterday, at the speech at the U.N., you spoke about how Venezuela's problem was because of Cuba and the Castros, how they went in there, and they brought socialism and communism to Venezuela and now to Nicaragua as well.
Mr. President, are you going to be more proactive now against Cuba as well?
The President. I've been very proactive against Cuba. I don't like what's happening in Cuba. As you know, President Obama gave them a pass, and I didn't like it. Neither do Cuban people based in Miami and based in our country that came from Cuba and suffered in Cuba.
I don't like what he did. I've ended much of it, most of it. I don't like what's happening in Cuba, and I certainly don't like what's happening in Venezuela.
Yes, please.
Q. Mr. President.
The President. Go ahead.
Socialism/Venezuela Q. Mr. President, just to finish really fast. You said also that you had a call to action to ask the leaders around the world to also end socialism. Would you like to be recognized as the President——
The President. Well, I wouldn't say that socialism has been working really well around the world, okay. You can take a look at Venezuela as your number one—your number one—I guess, the one that is most obvious. But you take a look around the world, socialism is not exactly riding high.
Please.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Go ahead.
Female Journalists 
Q. Thank you very much. If you don't mind, after I'm finished, if Weijia or Hallie or Vivian or one of our female colleagues could go after me that would be great.
Mr. President, just to follow up on these allegations against Brett Kavanaugh——
The President. What does he mean by that? Explain. [Laughter] What does that mean?
Q. I think it would be great if a female reporter——
The President. What does it mean? No, what does it mean?
Q. I think it would great if a female reporter would ask you a question about this issue. So if you don't mind, I would ask——
The President. I wouldn't mind that at all. No. Wouldn't mind it at all.
Q. All right. Well, let me—if I could call on——
The President. Wouldn't make any difference to me.
Q. All right.
The President. Go ahead.
2017 Alabama Senatorial Candidate Roy S. Moore/Sexual Assault 
Q. If I could follow up on John and John's question. Why is it, Mr. President, that you always seem to side with the accused and not the accuser? You have three women here who are all making allegations, who are all asking that their stories be heard. And, you know, if you look at the case of Roy Moore, if you look at the case of one of your staffers, you seem to, time and again, side with the accused and not the accuser. Is that because of the many allegations that you've had made against you over the years?
The President. Well, first of all, I wasn't happy with Roy Moore. Let's get that straight. But Roy Moore was a Republican candidate——
Q. But you stood by him.
The President. ——and I would have rather had a Republican candidate win. I was very happy with Luther Strange, who was a terrific man from Alabama, but Luther Strange had a lot of things going against him. As far as women, whether it's a man or a woman, these are—you know, it can happen the other way. Allegations can go the other way also. You understand that. And whether it was a man or a woman, 30 years ago, 36 years ago—in fact, they don't even know how many years ago because nobody knows what the time is—that's a long time.
And I could pick, as an example—hopefully, I won't have to do it as a replacement, because hopefully, this is going to go very well on Thursday. It's going to go very well on Monday or Saturday or Sunday or whenever they vote. But I could pick a woman, and she could have charges made from many years ago also.
Sexual Assault Allegations Against Supreme Court Nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh 
Q. But don't you understand, sir, that many of these——
The President. And I would look at the character——
Q. ——many of these accusers——
The President. No, what I have to do——
Q. ——are reluctant to come forward. You've raised doubts about these accusers. Many of them are reluctant to come forward.
The President. I don't think people are reluctant to come forward. They're going to have a chance to speak at a major—they have a major chance to speak.
Q. But you're saying why couldn't they come forward sooner.
The President. Excuse me. Excuse me. They have a major chance to speak. And it will be tomorrow, I assume. We've delayed this—meaning the Republican Senators, not me. The Republicans Senators have delayed this for weeks now. They're giving the women a major chance to speak.
Now, it's possible I'll hear that, and I'll say, ""Hey, I'm changing my mind."" That is possible. We want to give them a chance to speak. And they're given——
Sexual Assault Allegations Against Supreme Court Nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh 
Q. Do you think all three should have a chance—all three should have a chance to speak?
The President. Well, whoever is given a chance. We've delayed it a long time. But they're going to have a big shot at speaking and making their case. And you know what? I could be persuaded also. Okay?
Q. Thank you.
The President. Yes. Please. Please, go ahead. Go ahead. I would like to go—yes, go ahead. Please.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Thank you.
Sexual Assault Allegations Against Supreme Court Nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. And a couple of questions for you to follow up on some answers that I didn't quite hear from you, if you would allow me a couple of questions.
First of all, do you think these women—all three of them—are liars? Yes or no? The President. Have they been what?
Q. Are they liars?
The President. I can't tell you. I have to watch tomorrow. I have to read. I just heard about one a little while ago. I can tell you her lawyer is a low life, okay? So I can't tell you whether or not they're liars until I hear them.
I don't know what happened today because I've been very busy with Japan, with South Korea, with China, and about seven other countries, as you know, and I chaired the Security Council. So I don't know about today's person that came forward. I do know about the lawyer. And you don't get much worse, bad reputation too. Take a look at his past.
So, as far as the other women are concerned, I'm going to see what happens tomorrow. I'm going to be watching—you know, believe it or not. I'm going to see what's said. It's possible that they will be convincing.
Now, with all of that being said, Judge Brett Kavanaugh has been, for many years, one of the most respected people in Washington. He's been on, I guess you'd call it, the second highest court. And every single person knows him; a lot of people know him well. And those people don't believe what's going on. I can always be convinced. I have to hear it.
Senate Confirmation Hearings for Supreme Court Nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh 
Q. It sounds like what you're saying is, there is a situation, there is a scenario under which you would withdraw Brett Kavanaugh's nomination. Is that correct?
The President. If I thought he was——
Q. And have you talked about that with him?
The President. If I thought he was guilty of something like this, yes, sure.
Q. And you will wait until tomorrow to make up your mind about it?
The President. I want to watch. I want to see. I hope I can watch. I'm meeting with a lot of countries tomorrow, but I will certainly, in some form, be able to watch. And I'll also rely on some very fair and talented Republican Senators who—look, if we brought George Washington here and we said, ""We have George Washington,"" the Democrats would vote against him, just so you understand. [Laughter]
And he may have had a bad past, who knows, you know. [Laughter] He may have had some, I think, accusations made. Didn't he have a couple of things in his past? George Washington would be voted against 100 percent by Schumer and the con artists. I mean, 100 percent. One hundred percent.
So it really doesn't matter from their standpoint. That's why when John asked about the FBI. If the FBI did the most thorough investigation in the history of the FBI and they found him to be 100-percent perfect, he would lose every single vote.
Now, if the Republicans win tomorrow, I think you're going to get some votes from the Democrats. You know why? Because—we all know why—because it's called politics. Then, you'll probably get some votes.
Okay, let's go.
Q. And my final question, sir—— The President. One more question. Yes.
Q. ——and just to follow up on——
The President. She stands up: ""I'd like to ask about three questions."" It's not really fair to everyone else.
Q. This will be my last one——
The President. Should I let her ask another question?
[At this point, several reporters shouted questions.]
Q. ——to follow up on——
The President. Go ahead. See?
Men Accused of Sexual Assault 
Q. ——to follow up on a question that a colleague asked as well about the benefit of the doubt that you have given to people like Roy Moore, to Roger Ailes, to Bill O'Reilly, to Brett Kavanaugh. They're all men. Why is that?
The President. It's not a benefit of the doubt. I've——
Q. Has there ever been an instance when you've given the benefit of the doubt to a woman?
The President. I've known them. Hallie [Hallie Jackson, NBC News], I've know them for a long time and—a lot of these people. A lot of people. And some I've been disappointed with. I have been disappointed with some. Others, like—you know, there are charges that are pretty weak.
But I've known people for a long time. I never saw them do anything wrong. I never saw them do anything wrong. And there are some that probably—I agree. I can tell you there are some that I—I've been watching for a long time. And in a couple of cases, they weren't Republicans. In a lot of cases, they were not; they were exactly the opposite.
But I've been watching them for a long time. And I knew for a long time these were not good people. And they were never brought up.
Okay. Yes, ma'am. Go ahead.
Thank you very much by the way. Thank you.
Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President.
The President. Thank you.
Sexual Assault Allegations Against Supreme Court Nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh/Victims of Sexual Assault 
Q. When the allegations first surfaced, you initially said how important it was for Dr. Ford to testify and that you wanted to hear from her.
The President. I do.
Q. But——
The President. I wish it could have gone quicker. Q. Well, you also said that if what she said were as bad as she claims, surely, her or her parents would have reported it. And just today you said you wouldn't——
The President. Well, there is a truth. I mean there is a chance that her parents could have reported it 36 years ago.
Q. So my question is——
The President. It doesn't mean they had to report it, because in some instances, people keep it quiet. It's a very tough situation for a woman, there's no question about it. And in some cases, they do report it. Frankly, had they reported it, it would've been pretty amazing, wouldn't it?
But I guess they didn't, and that's okay. I'm not saying they had to report it, because it's a very personal thing. It's a very big problem, there's no question about it.
Go ahead.
Senate Confirmation Hearings for Supreme Court Nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh 
Q. But do you want to hear her story before you draw a conclusion——
The President. I'd like to hear her story, yes. Well, we're giving her a time.
Q. ——or have you already made up your mind?
The President. They would've given her time last week. This is the United States Senate. This is the most important position that a President can give out, I think we can say, by far. I've actually heard it's the most important decision a President can make. I disagree with that. War and peace—I always say ""war and peace""—and after that, Supreme Court Justice. Right?
I look forward to hearing from her. We could've heard from her last week; we could have heard from her for a long time. It will be interesting to hear what she has to say. Okay?
Sexual Assault Allegations Against the President 
Q. And let me follow up on Jim's question. Mr. President, let me follow up on Jim's question that I don't think we got an answer to.
The President. Which one? Which question? Who?
Q. How have your personal experiences being accused by more than a dozen women of sexual misconduct——
The President. I've been accused. I've been accused. False accusations.
Q. Right, how have those——
The President. Excuse me. I've been accused. And I was accused by—I believe, it was—four women. You can check with Sean Hannity. You can check with Fox, because they covered it very strongly—who got paid.
Sexual Assault Allegations Against the President/News Media 
Q. And how has that changed——
The President. Excuse me. Excuse me. I was accused by four or five women who got paid a lot of money to make up stories about me. We caught them, and the mainstream media refused to put it on television. They refused to even write about it. There were four women and maybe more; I think the number is four or five. But one had a mortgage paid off her house, $52,000. Another one had other things happen. And the one that reported it, I believe, was offered $750,000 to say bad things about me, and she is the one that reported it. This woman is incredible. She reported it, instead of taking the money.
So I've had numerous accusations about me.
Q. Right.
The President. I mean, they made false statements about me, knowing they were false. I never met them. I never met these people. And what did they do? What did they do?
They took money in order to say bad things. I've had stories written in the New York Times—front page—about four women. The whole top center front page of the New York Times. I think it was four big pictures.
I said: ""Wow. That's a big thing. What's that?"" These were women that were quoted saying bad things about me. Not the worst things about me, but bad things. And I said, ""Gee, that's too bad."" I knew them a long time ago, 15 years ago, 20 years ago. I said: ""That's too bad. I'm surprised at them.""
And then, all of a sudden, I see them on television, nothing to do with me. The next day or a day later, they were incensed. They said: ""Donald Trump is a nice guy. We never said this. The New York Times did false reporting. They're fake news."" And you know what? The New York Times would not report that their story was fake.
These women said great things. Not only did they not say the bad stuff, they said great things about me. Front page. And those women—they're incredible women—they went on television—and they didn't want to, and I didn't ask them. And they said: ""The New York Times made it up. They gave false quotes."" And they went on a lot of shows. They were really incensed, and they couldn't believe it.
That's why people know that a lot of the news is fake. And a lot of the people sitting here are fake. But 20 percent of them are wonderful. Okay?
Sexual Assault Allegations Against the President and Supreme Court Nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh 
Q. If I could just actually ask my question, Mr. Trump. I—you didn't let me ask my question.
The President. You've been asking a question for 10 minutes, all right?
Q. No, you interrupted my question.
The President. Please sit down. Please.
Q. I'm asking you——
The President. Go ahead. Go ahead.
Q. ——how did those impact your opinions on the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh?
The President. Well, it does impact my opinion. You know why? Because I've had a lot of false charges made against me. I'm a very famous person, unfortunately. I've been a famous person for a long time. But I've had a lot of false charges made against me, really false charges. I know friends that have had false charges. People want fame. They want money. They want whatever. So when I see it, I view it differently than somebody sitting home watching television, where they say, ""Oh, Judge Kavanaugh . . ."" this or that.
It's happened to me many times. I've had many false charges; I had a woman sitting in an airplane, and I attacked her while people were coming onto the plane. And I have a number-one bestseller out? I mean it was total phony story. There are many of them.
So when you say, does it affect me in terms of my thinking with respect to Judge Kavanaugh? Absolutely. Because I've had it many times.
And if the news would have reported these four people—I couldn't believe it. When I heard that they caught these four people, I said: ""Wow. That's a big story."" And it was—for Fox. Okay.
China's Efforts To Influence 2018 Congressional Elections 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Earlier today and just now, you made a significant allegation against the Chinese Government. You suggested that the Chinese——
The President. I did.
Q. ——had meddled in or are meddling in——
The President. That's right. That's what I hear.
Q. ——the 2018 midterm elections.
The President. That's what I hear.
Q. What evidence do you have of that, sir? Is there a national intelligence estimate——
The President. We have evidence. We have evidence. It will come out.
Q. ——for example, that you're prepared to put forward?
The President. Yes, I can't tell you now, but it came—it didn't come out of nowhere that I can tell you.
Q. But why make the charge now?
The President. Now, if you—they've actually admitted that they're going after farmers. I mean, I think most of you can cover that.
I like that you're shaking your head, ""yes."" I'm going to ask you the next question because of that. Okay? It's probably going to be the killer of all questions. [Laughter] But let me just explain——
China-U.S. Relations/U.S. Economy/Interest Rates 
Q. But why make the charges now——
The President. No, no, no. Let me——
Q. ——if you're not prepared to come forward with the evidence, sir?
The President. China, now, put on $250 billion, and they're paying 25 percent on that. They're paying billions and billions. This has never happened to China. And I like China, and I like President Xi a lot. I think he's a friend of mine. He may not be a friend of mine anymore, but he—I think he probably respects—— From what I hear—if you look at Mr. Pillsbury, the leading authority on China—he was on a good show—I won't mention the name of the show—recently. And he was saying that China has total respect for Donald Trump and for Donald Trump's very, very large brain. He said, ""Donald—Donald Trump."" [Laughter] ""They don't know what to do."" It never happened.
Well, one thing they are trying to do is, they are trying to convince people to go against Donald Trump. Because a normal, regular, political person that has no concept of what the hell he's doing would let China continue to take $500 billion a year out of our country and rebuild their country. I mean, they were building 29 massive bridges like the George Washington Bridge. They're building things that we don't build anymore. But we're starting to build them again.
And our economy now is hotter than it's ever been. I don't know you if you saw the confidence levels this morning that just cam","e out. Fantastic.
And in all fairness to the Fed raising rates, they're raising rates because we've never done like we're doing now. And one of the things that is nice about the rates: the people that were hurt the worst by these zero interest rates and, you know—when President Obama had an economy that was—it was the worst comeback since the Great Depression and all that—you've all heard that. But remember, he was playing with zero-interest money. He was playing with funny money. That's easy. I'm playing with fairly expensive money.
So when he does that, the people that benefit are people that actually—in their whole life, they would save 10, 15, 20 percent of their salary and put it in the bank. Those people got killed because they put their money in the bank. They were going to live off the interest, and there was no interest.
Now, those people are starting to get interest. And those are the people, frankly, that deserve to—you know, they did a great job. The people that did it right, the people that did the best job, got hurt the most. So in one sense I like it, but basically, I'm a low-interest-rate person, I hate to tell you.
Q. Have you told——
The President. Yes. Yes, ma'am. Yes. Yes, go ahead.
Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein/Investigation Into Russia's Interference in 2016 Presidential Election 
Q. Mr. President, you have another meeting tomorrow with Rod Rosenstein.
The President. Yes.
Q. Are you planning to fire Rod Rosenstein?
The President. I'm talking to him. We've had a good talk. He said he never said it. He said he doesn't believe it. He said he has a lot of respect for me, and he was very nice, and we'll see. And he's a member of the Trump administration, in that sense; it's the Justice Department.
I would certainly prefer not doing that. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction—I mean, unless you call obstruction the fact that I fight back. I do fight back. I really fight back. I mean, if you call that obstruction, that's fine.
But there's no obstruction. There's no collusion. I'm going to meet with him tomorrow. I may call Rod tonight or tomorrow and ask for a little bit of a delay to the meeting, because I don't want to do anything that gets in the way of this very important Supreme Court pick. So I don't want it competing and hurting the decision—one way or the other decision. Again, I want to hear what she has to say.
But I want to do—so I may delay that. I'm going to see. I don't want to do anything that's going to conflict with that. But my preference would be to keep him and to let him finish up.
You know, I call it a ""witch hunt."" And it is a witch hunt. If you look at the FBI statements with Strzok and his lover Lisa Page. If you look at all of the things that have gone on in the FBI. If you look at McCabe taking $700,000 from a Hillary Clinton PAC, essentially run by Terry McAuliffe, who's her best friend in the world, and he gives them hundreds of thousands of dollars. And he's in charge of her campaign, and his wife is getting all of this money to run—she lost—to run. [Laughter] I mean, what's going on?
If you look at the horrible statements, like: ""Way to go, Page. Great story you put into a newspaper. Essentially, now we'll go and investigate that group."" It's terrible. We have caught people doing things that are terrible. I would much prefer keeping Rod Rosenstein. Much prefer. Many people say I have the right to absolutely fire him. He said he did not say it. He said he does not believe that. And nobody in this room believes it.
By the way, I deal with the people in this room. I was with Mike Pompeo before, and we were dealing, at a very high level, with Japan. And I was saying things that nobody in the room even understood. And I said them a long time ago, and I was right. He said, ""That's not the 25th Amendment that I'm looking at."" I think I can say that from Mike.
25th Amendment to the Constitution 
Q. So you don't think anyone in your administration has ever discussed the 25th—using the 25th Amendment against you?
The President. I don't think so. Well, yes—enemies, sure. You use anything you can.
Q. Was it in your administration or your Cabinet?
The President. Hey, you use anything they can. They're not in love with me. They're not going to beat me in the election; they know that. They're not going to beat me. The people that I'm looking at are total lightweights. I dream of running against those people.
25th Amendment to the Constitution/2020 Presidential Election/Democratic Party Criticisms of the President 
Q. But within your administration?
The President. Maybe they'll come up with somebody that's not—they're not going to beat me. I'm against what they want to do. I'm in favor of law enforcement. I'm in favor of safety and security and low taxes. I want low taxes.
I want borders. We're getting another $1.6 billion in borders. I want borders. We've spent $3.2 [billion; White House correction.], and we're getting another $1.6 [billion; White House correction.]. And then eventually, we're getting the whole thing and we'll complete the wall.
They don't want that. They don't want that. They don't want the things that I have.
Now, I must say, I know many of the Democrats. They'll say things and then wink at me. And again, it's the same old story. They'll say things; they don't mean it. It's politics. The reason they don't want me is because they want to run the show. They want it. It's power. It's whatever you want to call it. But what they've done here is a disgrace, a total disgrace.
And what they do—I know, it's sort of interesting—in one case, they say: ""He's a fascist. He's taking over the Government. He's the most powerful President ever. He's a horrible human being. He wants to take over the entire Government, and he's going to do it. We can't stop him."" That didn't work.
The next week, he said, ""Uh, he's incompetent."" I said, ""Well, wait a minute."" In one case, I'm taking over the world. [Laughter] And in the other case, ""He's incompetent."" They tried that for a week; that didn't work.
Look, these are very dishonest people. These are con artists. And the press knows it, but the press doesn't write it.
[At this point, many reporters began speaking at once.]
Wow. That's a lot of hands. That's a lot of—oh, Steve [Steve A. Holland, Reuters], go ahead. Here's a very high-quality person, this man, but he'll probably hit me with a bad one. [Laughter]
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Why——
The President. Go ahead. Give it to me. Give it to me, Steve. Reuters.
North Korea/Former President Barack Obama/Russia 
Q. You're getting letters from Chairman Kim. Why do you need a second summit with the North Korean leader so soon? And what do you——
The President. Because he'd like it.
Q. What would it be for?
The President. So I've received two letters from Chairman Kim. At some point, I'll, you know, give these letters; they're incredible letters. They're letters that are magnificent in the sense of his feeling for wanting to get this done. I really believe he wants to get it done. I may be wrong.
I heard somebody on a certain network last night—I won't mention which one—say, ""Why has President Trump given so much to North Korea?"" I said, ""Wait a minute."" I asked Sarah Huckabee, ""Please call this person."" I gave nothing; other than I met. What did I give them?
I didn't do what Obama did: Give them $1.8 billion in cash to get back four hostages. I got back our hostages; I never paid them anything. I haven't paid them 10 cents.
But he wants to make a deal, and I'd like to make a deal. We actually have a very good relationship together, a lot different than the last time I was at the United Nations. That was a little bit rough.
Don't forget, that time, they said: ""Oh, Trump is saying these horrible things. He's going to get us into a war."" You were going to have a war. If I wasn't elected, you'd be in war. And President Obama essentially said the same thing. He was ready to go to war.
You would have had a war, and you would have lost millions, not thousands. You would have lost millions of people. Seoul has 30 million people, 40 miles and 30 miles from this very dangerous border. If I wasn't elected, you would have had a war. President Obama thought you had to go to war. You know how close he was to pressing the trigger for war? Millions of people. With me, nobody is talking about that. Nobody is talking about that.
We have a very good relationship. He likes me. I like him. We get along. He wrote me two of the most beautiful letters. When I showed one of the letters—just one—to Prime Minister Abe, he said: ""This is actually a groundbreaking letter. This is an incredible—this is a historic letter."" And it is a historic letter. It's a beautiful piece of art. And I think we're going to make a deal.
Will we make a deal, Steve? I don't really know. But I think we're going to. In the meantime—and I've said it a—I don't want to bore you: no rockets, no missiles, no nuclear tests. You know, for over a year, where you haven't seen.
Before I got here, everybody in this room thought you were going to war. And then, what happened—it was funny—they said: ""He was terrible. He was so rough with Chairman Kim—Kim Jong Un. He was so rough. It's terrible. He's going to cause""—well, I had a great meeting with President Putin. And on that one, they said, ""He was too soft with President Putin."" I had a great meeting with the President. It lasted for 2 hours. We discussed everything: Ukraine, Syria, Israel and Israel's protection. We had a great meeting. They wanted me to end up in a boxing match.
And you know what? If I was killer-tough with President Putin, they would have said, ""He was too tough."" You can't win with these people, but you just keep going. In the meantime, we're doing well.
Go ahead.
Q. So how do you—how long do you——
The President. Wait. One second.
North Korea/Former President Barack Obama 
Q. How long do you think it should take North Korea to denuclearize?
The President. I don't know. I don't want to get into——
Q. We've seen estimates of 1 year, 2 year——
The President. Steve, I don't want to get into the time game. You know why? I told Mike Pompeo, I said, ""Mike, don't get into the time game."" We stopped them. They're taking down plants. They're taking down a lot of different testing areas. They're going to take down some more. You'll be hearing about that very soon. I don't want to go ahead of myself, but you'll be hearing about it soon. They have no interest right now in testing nuclear.
You know, we had a case just about when I was coming into office—you all remember it—where there was a massive—they thought it was an earthquake. A mountain moved over an inch and a half. We're talking about mountains. You know, North Korea is very mountainous. Beautiful land. Beautiful. This mountain actually shifted. It shifted. And somebody thought it was an earthquake. And then, they found out, no, this was nuclear testing. Shifted a mountain. Now I'm talking about serious stuff, serious size.
When I came in, and certainly before I came in—and even at the beginning of mine, because when I was having rhetorical contests—you know, contests, really, I guess you could call it—with Chairman Kim, which we both smile at now and we laugh at. But everybody thought that was a horrible thing.
We've had many Presidents who were unable to do anything, anything at all with North Korea. We now have a good relationship. We have a good relationship. And most importantly, all of the things that you've been hearing about—the horror stories—in my opinion, they're gone.
Now, could they start up again? Yes. I'm a deal guy. Could they start? Yes. Could be that we don't work it out. I think—I have it right here—I think that what we've done behind the scenes, which nobody really knows about—and I don't blame you for not knowing about, you know, personal letters, private letters. But saying they want to get it done. We know much more than the media for a change. Much more. But if you saw what's going on behind the scenes, I think you'd very impressed.
We were a country going to war. I really believe that President Obama would admit that he said it's by far his biggest problem. When I sat with him, prior to going to office—going into office, he said to me that's by far the biggest problem. And he said to me that he was very close to going into war.
And millions of people—not—you know, I—they say, ""Oh, thousands of people . . ."" No, no, no, not thousands. Millions of people would have been killed. And that could have left—you're right next to China; you're right—that could have been a world war very easily.
Right now we're in a great position. I don't want to play the time game. I told Mike Pompeo, ""Don't let them do that to you."" I haven't given anything. And all of a sudden—we got back, it was a few weeks ago. I think we were back, like, 2½ months from the summit, which was a great success. And people are screaming, ""What's taking so long?"" I said, ""Oh, I get it."" You've got to understand the media. I've been dealing with the media all my life. Too much. Too much.
They're screaming, and I saw that. And our guys were—and not Mike—but our guys were being, ""Oh well, we're working as fast . . ."" I said: ""I've got all the time in the world. I don't have to rush it."" There's no—you know, secession of sanctions. We've got the sanctions on. I didn't take any sanctions off.
I did see a reporter last night—a guy I like, personally, a lot—and he asked a question to President Moon of South Korea. He said, ""Why did the President give so much?"" I didn't give anything. I gave nothing. What have I given, other than some time? Yes, I flew to Singapore. We had a meeting.
Now, giving would be if I took the sanctions off. I didn't want to do—if you asked General Mattis, for a year and a half, I said, ""Why don't we stop these ridiculous,"" in my opinion, ""the military games?"" I call them the ""military games."" If I told you how much those games cost—and frankly, I told South Korea, ""You should be paying for these games."" We pay for them.
They say, ""Well, we fly the planes in from a short distance away."" I said, ""Where is that?"" ""Guam."" ""Oh, huh. How long a trip is that?"" ""Seven hours."" ""Oh, great."" We're flying these massive bombers and everything. I've wanted to stop this for a long time. I consider that an asset.
But we've done—we're saving, by the way—just for the taxpayer, we're saving a fortune. And if we need them, we can start them up immediately. If I think we need them, I'll start them before the generals will start them. The fact is, this reporter said that. I said: ""What have we done? I haven't given anything."" And we're really onto the cusp. I think we're really going to do something that's going to be very important.
But we're not playing the time game. If it takes 2 years, 3 years, or 5 months, it doesn't matter. There's no nuclear testing, and there's no testing of rockets.
Yes, ma'am. Go ahead. Go ahead. Please.
Q. Thank you.
The President. This is the one that was nodding with every nice thing I said, so watch this question.
Comcast Corp. Acquisition of Sky News 
Q. It's a habit of mine. Hannah Thomas-Peter from Sky News.
The President. You're with who?
Q. Hannah Thomas-Peter from Sky News.
The President. Okay, good. Sky News.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Congratulations on the purchase. [Laughter]
Q. Nothing to do with me.
The President. I hope you benefited. [Laughter] Go ahead.
Sexual Assault Allegations Against Supreme Court Nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh 
Q. Are you at all concerned at the message that has been sending—being sent to the women who are watching this when you use language like ""con job"" in relation to allegations of sexual assault?
The President. Oh, I've used much worse language in my life than ""con job."" That's, like, probably the nicest phrase I've ever used. I mean, con job—it is. It's a con job. You know, confidence—it's a confidence job, but they shorten—it's a con job by the Democrats. They know it.
Investigation Into Russia's Interference in 2016 Presidential Election 
Q. What about the message that's being sent to women who are watching?
The President. They did the same thing with the Russia investigation. They tried to convince people that I had something to do with Russia. There was no collusion.
Think of it. I'm in Wisconsin. I'm in Michigan. I say, ""Gee, we're not doing well."" I won both those States. ""We're not doing well. Uh, let me call the Russians to help."" Does anybody really believe that? It's a con job.
And I watch these guys, Little Adam Schiff and all of the guys. He takes a call from a Russian who turned out to be a faker. You know, he was a comedian or something. ""This is so-and-so calling for . . .""—he took the call. Why is the taking a call from a Russian? Senator Warner took a call from a Russian. He was a comedian or something, but he said, ""We have pictures of President Trump."" ""Oh, where can I get them?"" If we ever did that, it would be, like, a big deal.
Yes, it's a con job. And it's not a bad term. It's not a bad term at all.
Sexual Assault Allegations Against Supreme Court Nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh/2016 Presidential Election 
Q. Are you worried that——
The President. I'll tell you one thing I can say: I've had a lot of people talking about this to me, with respect to what's happening, because it's a horrible precedent.
I'm going to have to get other judges and other Supreme Court judges, possibly. I could have a lot of the Supreme Court judges, more than two. And when I called up Brett Kavanaugh—spoke to him and his family—and told them that I chose them, they were so happy and so honored. It was as though—I mean, the biggest thing that's ever happened. And I understand that: U.S. Supreme Court.
I don't want to be in a position where people say: ""No, thanks. No, thanks. I don't want to—you know, I spoke to somebody 38 years ago, and it may not be good."" We have a country to run. We want the best talent in the world.
But I'll tell you this: The people that have complained to me about it the most—about what's happening—are women. Women are very angry.
You know, I got 52 percent with women. Everyone said, ""This couldn't happen—52 percent."" Women are so angry. And I, frankly, think that—I think they like what the Republicans are doing, but I think they would have liked to have seen it go a lot faster. But give them their day in court. Let her have her day in court. Let somebody else have a day in court.
But the ones that I find—I mean, I have men that don't like it, but I have women that are incensed at what's going on. I've always said women are smarter than men. I've said that a lot, and I mean it. But women are incensed at what's going on.
Yes, go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead, in the back.
Q. Sorry. It's me?
The President. Who are you? Or where are you from?
Q. It's me? It's me?
The President. Yes, you. [Laughter] The guy looks—the guy looks like he's shocked. That's not—this is going to be not good. [Laughter]
Q. It's going to be good, sir.
The President. The guy looks totally like stunned that I—have you ever been picked before for a question? [Laughter]
Q. Yes, sir, but not from President of the United States.
The President. Go ahead. Go ahead. Give me a question.
Kurdistan Region of Iraq/Islamic State of Iraq and Syria Terrorist Organization Q. Thank you very much. My name is Majeed Gly from Rudaw Media Network. I want to, sir, ask you—you always talk about——
The President. Excuse me, you said where? From where?
Q. Rudaw Media Network from Kurdistan region, north of Iraq.
The President. Okay.
Q. I'm a Kurd. Sir——
The President. Good. Good. Great people.
Q. Thank you, sir.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Great people.
Q. You are too.
The President. Thank you. Are you a Kurd?
Q. Yes, I am.
Q. Mr. President. Mr. President, I want to——
The President. Good.
Q. Mr. President——
The President. They're great people. They're great fighters. I like them a lot. Let's go. I like this question so far.
Q. Mr. President, you always say you support your allies. Kurds right now, after the defeat of ISIS, are under a lot of pressure in Syria and in Iraq by many adversaries.
The President. It's true.
Q. What will you do to elevate their position to support them in order—after they help the United States to defeat ISIS? Thank you very much.
The President. Well, we are helping them a lot and we've been very friendly with them. And as you know, we've fought side by side. And we have defeated ISIS—essentially, a very short while ago—in the Middle East. And we did it with a lot of help from the Kurds. And they are: They're great fighters.
You know, some people are great fighters, and some people aren't. The Kurds are great fighters. And they're great, great people. And we're going to be working—we're discussing that situation exactly right now.
Q. What will you do to support them, sir, outside Syria?
The President. Well, I'm just telling you, we're going to be discussing that situation. We have already started discussing that situation. But we have tremendous support from the Kurds in defeating ISIS. Okay?
Q. And about Syria: Sir, in your speech you did not mention——
The President. Uh, yes. Go. Uh-oh.
Q. Where's the microphone? Here we go. [Laughter] The President. You don't need it. [Laughter]
Canada-U.S. Trade 
Q. Mr. President, Susan Li from Fox Business. Did you reject a one-on-one meeting with the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau?
The President. Yes, I did.
Q. Why?
The President. Because his tariffs are too high, and he doesn't seem to want to move, and I've told him, ""Forget about it."" And frankly, we're thinking about just taxing cars coming in from Canada. That's the mother lode. That's the big one. We're very unhappy with the negotiations and the negotiating style of Canada.
We don't like their representative very much. They've taken advantage—I love Canada, by the way. I have so many friends. I have everybody and so many friends. But that has nothing to do with this; I'm representing the United States.
Mexico was totally—I mean, they were great. By the way, the new President has been great. The deal is done. Now, it has to go through Congress, and you know, a lot things have to happen. But we've done—Bob Lighthizer, who's here someplace. Where's Bob? Bob. Bob Lighthizer has done a great job of negotiating, as they have. But the deal is done. It's up to Congress.
Q. And, Mr. President——
The President. But Canada has treated us very badly. They've treated our farmers in Wisconsin and New York State and a lot of other States very badly. Dairy products, 300 percent. Three hundred percent. How do you sell a dairy product at 300 percent? The answer is, you don't. What it is, is a barrier. It's—basically, they're saying: ""We don't have any barriers. By the way, it's 300 percent."" So you don't send it in, because you can't compete.
So Canada has a long way to go. I must be honest with you, we're not getting along at all with their negotiators. We think their negotiators have taken advantage of our country for a long time. We had people that didn't know what they were doing. And that's why we had—over the last 5 or 6 years, if you average it out—we had $800 billion a year in trade losses. It's ridiculous. It's not going to happen.
North American Free Trade Agreement 
Q. What about NAFTA? Sir, Mr. President, NAFTA——
The President. Go ahead.
Q. What does that mean for NAFTA? Will you be pulling out of NAFTA?
The President. I don't like NAFTA. I never liked it. It's been very bad for the United States. It's been great for Canada. It's been great for Mexico. Very bad for us.
Q. But will you pull out of the accord?
The President. I'm not going to use the name ""NAFTA."" I refuse to use it. I've seen thousands of plants and factories close. I've seen millions of jobs lost to auto companies that moved. I mean, Mexico has 25 percent of our auto business now because of NAFTA. Under our deal, it's not going to happen anymore. I hate to tell you, it's not. We're not—we're going to keep companies. And I told the Mexicans, I said, ""We have to keep companies."" But they're getting a lot, also. They're getting other things. They're getting a lot of good things. Mexico made a very good deal.
But with Canada, it's very tough. What we're doing is if we made a deal with Canada—which is a, you know, a good chance still. But I'm not making anything near what they want to do. We're going to be fair.
U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Negotiations 
Q. But you're—are you going to notify Congress of pulling out of NAFTA?
The President. What we're probably going to do is call it the ""USMC."" Like the United States Marine Corps, which I love. General Kelly likes it even more. Where's General Kelly? He likes that. ""USMC""—which would be U.S., Mexico, Canada. But it'll probably or possibly be just ""USM."" It will be United States and Mexico.
Q. Yes or no, are you going to——
The President. Canada will come along. Now, if Canada doesn't make a deal with us, we're going to make a much better deal. We're going to tax the cars that come in. We will put billions and billions of dollars into our Treasury. And frankly, we'll be very happy, because it's actually more money than you can make, under any circumstance, with making a deal. Okay?
Good job too. You do a very good job. Really good. Yes, please, Mr. Kurd.
Kurdistan Region of Iraq 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. [Laughter] [Inaudible]—Mr. President.
The President. Go ahead.
Q. Thank you very much for your time, Mr. President. Two, quickly, questions: What will be the U.S.A. relations with the Kurds——
The President. Oh, I thought I just answered that.
Q. ——post-ISIS? Post-ISIS.
The President. Okay. We're trying to get along very well. We do get along great with the Kurds. We're trying to help them a lot. Don't forget, that's their territory.
Q. That's the——
The President. We have to help them. I want to help them.
Go ahead, what's next?
Q. Then, what——
The President. They fought with us. They fought with us. They died with us. They died. We lost—tens of thousands of Kurds died fighting ISIS. They died for us and with us. And for themselves. They died for themselves. But they're great people. And we have not forget—we don't forget—I don't forget. What happens someday later—but I can tell you that I don't forget. These are great people.
Okay. Yes, ma'am. Please. Please——
Iran/China/Syria Q. About Iran, Mr. President. About Iran, one question: What is your clear plan to stop Iranian influence in Iraq, in Syria, and especially in Iraqi Kurdistan?
The President. Boy, I think you've seen that. I must tell you, it's—I don't mind your question because——
Q. Rahim Rashidi from Kurdistan TV [Kurdistan 24]. Thank you.
The President. I think there's been no greater change—other than maybe China, because China—unfortunately, their markets have dropped—would you say, 30 percent in the last 4 months, right? I think I watched you recently when you said that. I said: ""I think she's wrong. I think it's actually 32. But that's okay."" But a lot. [Laughter]
There's been no—other than maybe that, but even that. Because China is a very special place. And Iran is a very special place. But I think there's been no country that's changed so much as Iran.
In the last 6 months, since I took off the horrible, horrible Iran nuclear deal, as they called it—one of the dumbest deals ever made. As an example, why didn't they take care of Yemen in the deal? Why didn't they take care of Syria in the deal? You know what Kerry said—the reason? ""It was too complicated.""
We're giving $150 billion, we paid $1.8 billion in cash—cash. This whole room would be filled up with hundred-dollar bills. And you'd need probably five rooms like this. But you have $1.8 billion in cash. Why didn't we take care of Yemen? Why didn't we take care of Syria and other? And he said, ""Because it was too complicated."" Well, you just gave all your cards. You gave them $150 billion. And now Yemen's a mess, but it's getting better.
And Syria's a mess. And I was responsible—and I hope it stays that way—when I put out on social media, a few weeks ago, about Idlib Province. I said, ""Don't do it."" And I'll tell you, it happened—where I was at a meeting with a lot of supporters, and a woman stood up, and she said: ""There's a province in Syria with 3 million people. Right now the Iranians, the Russians, and the Syrians are surrounding their province. And they're going to kill my sister. And they're going to kill millions of people in order to get rid of 25,000 or 35,000 terrorists or enemies of theirs."" But I think we can call them terrorists.
And I said, ""That's not going to happen."" I didn't hear of Idlib Province. And I came back to New York, and I picked up the failing New York Times—I hate to admit it was the New York Times, but it was the failing New York Times—and I opened it up—not on the front page, but there was a very big story. I said, ""Wow, that's the same story that the woman told me that I found hard to believe."" Because why would—how would anyone do that with 3 million people? And it said that they were being surrounded, and they were going in and starting—literally, the next day, they were going to drop bombs all over the place and perhaps kill millions of people in order to get 35,000 terrorists.
And I put out on social media and elsewhere—I gave Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, everybody these orders: ""Don't let it happen."" I said, ""Don't let it happen."" That doesn't mean they can't be selective. They can't be—you know, go in, and they've got to do what they've got to do with terrorists. I assume they're terrorists. But don't kill millions of people.
And it stopped. You saw that. Nobody's going to give me credit, but that's okay. That's okay. Because the people know. I have had more Syrians thank me for that. This was about 4 weeks ago, I put that out. I said: ""They're surrounding a city of 3 million people. They're"," going to start bombing the city. Don't let it happen."" And I meant it, too. I meant it. And millions of people have been saved.
And I gave, today, great credit to Iran. I don't know if you heard that. I gave great credit to Iran, to Russia, and to Syria for not doing it. Now I hope it's going to be surgical, meaning go in and do—it's lengthy and everything else. And they possibly have to do it. But I think millions of people would have been killed. And that would have been a shame.
And hopefully—and I have to tell you, Turkey has been a big help. Turkey has been great. Turkey has helped us very much with that whole situation.
Q. Mr. President.
The President. Yes. Yes.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Good. Thank you very much.
Iran/Former President Barack Obama 
Q. Touching back on Iran: Of course, this week, you've put out a call to action to other countries to rally with America, to put pressure on Iran. Rouhani is still calling for the U.S. to come back into the old deal. But after meeting with world leaders this week, did you make any progress towards a potential new deal?
The President. It doesn't matter what world leaders think on Iran. Iran's going to come back to me and they're going to make a good deal, I think. Maybe not. Deals: you never know.
But they're suffering greatly. They're having riots in every city, far greater than they were during the green period with President Obama. Far greater. When President Obama stuck up for government, not the people. You probably would have had a much different Iran had he not done that. But I'm sticking up for the people. I am with the people of Iran.
But here's the thing: They have rampant inflation. Their money is worthless. Everything is going wrong. They have riots in the street. You can't buy bread. You can't do anything. It's a disaster. At some point, I think they're going to want to come back, and they're going to want to say, ""Hey, can we do something?""
And I'm very simple; I just don't want them to have nuclear weapons. That's all. Is that too much to ask? I don't want them to have nuclear weapons.
I want them to have a great economy. I want them to sell so much oil so that the oil prices—I'm not happy with OPEC. I told them, ""I'm not happy with OPEC."" We take care of all these people; we defend them. They wouldn't be there for 2 weeks if it wasn't for me and the United States and a much stronger Armed Forces than it was. Because our Armed Forces was depleted. We had old equipment.
Now, we have—hey, you know better than anybody, $700 billion and $716 billion. We have the most incredible new jets and everything. We need it. Not that I want to spend it, although it is jobs. It's all made in the United States.
But Iran has to come back, and they have to talk. And I'm not doing this from strength or weakness. I'm just saying, at some point, I think they're going to have to come back. If you look at what's going on, companies are leaving left and right. Mercedes-Benz just left. They're all leaving. They don't want to be in Iran. Because they have a choice: Do they want to be with Iran, or do they want to be with us?
And we have, by—we picked up $10 trillion since my election. We were being caught by China. Now it's going the other way. People can't believe it. People have never seen this situation with China. Everything's always been for 20 years: ""Oh, China is so great. China is so great."" You don't hear that so much anymore. I love China; I think they're great. But you don't hear that so much anymore. You know who's great now? We're great now.
Okay, how about just a couple of more. Now, I could be doing this all day long. I could be doing this all day long. Should we continue for a little while?
Q. Yes. Mr. President.
The President. It doesn't matter to me. A couple of more. I don't care. New York Times, come on. New York Times. The failing New York Times. Stand up. Go ahead.
News Media 
Q. You're talking about me, but I'm actually here with—
The President. No, I'm talking about the Times is failing. You are far from failing. Go ahead.
Q. Okay, but you're not—you were pointing to me, so you meant me. But I——
The President. The Times are very interesting though. The Times, I think they're going to endorse me. [Laughter]
Q. Yes. Yes.
The President. I think that ABC. I think—well, Fox—I like Fox. I really do.
Q. Just to be sure——
The President. But I think ABC, CBS, NBC, the Times, the—they're all going to endorse me, because if they don't, they're going out of business. Can you imagine if you didn't have me?
Go ahead, what would you like to say?
Q. Just to be sure, I know you were pointing to me, but I work for PBS NewsHour now.
The President. I know that. No, I know that.
The President's Remarks to the United Nations General Assembly 
Q. [Laughter] Okay. So I want to ask you: Yesterday you were talking about your administration's accomplishments at the United Nations, and a lot of the leaders laughed. Why do you think they were laughing?
The President. Well, that's fake news.
Q. And what was that experience like for you?
The President. Yes. It was fake news. And it was covered that way. Okay. So I said that since my election our economy has become the hottest in the world. Tax reductions, regulations, confidence levels are the highest in 18 years—really, soon to be historic. Unemployment is the lowest in the history of our country. You look at Black unemployment. You look at Asian unemployment. You look at women—65 years. The unemployment numbers are among the best we've ever had ever. The numbers of new companies pouring into our country, which nobody thought was possible.
And I said this. And I was in front of a large group of highly professional people, most of whom are from either other countries or the United Nations, people that aren't big into clapping, applauding, smiling. And I heard a little rustle, as I said our country is now stronger than ever before. It's true. I mean, it is true. And I heard a little rustle. And I said, ""It's true."" And I heard smiles. And I said, ""Oh, I didn't know there there'd be that kind . . ."" They weren't laughing at me. They were laughing with me. We had fun. That was not laughing at me.
So the fake news said, ""People laughed at President Trump."" They didn't laugh at me. People had a good time with me. We were doing it together. We had a good time. They respect what I've done.
The United States is respected again. The United States was not respected. Everybody was taking advantage of us, from jobs, and taking our companies, and not paying the price—to so many other things, even military protection. I told a number of countries over the last few days, I said: ""Listen, you're a very rich country. We protect you. Without our protection, you would have real problems. You would have real problems.""
U.S. Military Aid 
Q. And I want to——
The President. I said: ""You should reimburse us for this protection. Why are we protecting you?"" And do you want to know what they said after about 2 minutes of talking? They agreed with me. And you can ask this group of very talented people: They agreed with me.
But they said—one of them said: ""But Mr. President, nobody ever asked us for that. They never asked us for that."" Nobody has ever said, ""You should pay."" These are really wealthy countries.
I mean, I'll be honest, I just asked Japan. I said: ""We're defending you. You're a very wealthy country. You're sending us millions of cars. You're making a fortune. We have a tremendous trade deficit with you. And we're defending you, and we're subsidizing your military with a massive amount of money.""
I said it to South Korea. We have 32,000 soldiers in South Korea. They're a very wealthy—these are great countries. These are very wealthy countries. I said, ""Why aren't you reimbursing us for our costs?""
And you know what? They look at me, and they can't even answer it, because there's no answer. If they're a poor country and they needed protection and people were going to die, I'm all for protecting them; I don't want 10 cents. But when wealthy countries that have massive trade surpluses with us—massive—and then on top of that, we're paying for their military? Or we're paying for a lot of their military? That doesn't work.
How about two more, and we'll call it?
Sexual Assault Allegations Against Supreme Court Nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh 
Q. Mr. President, really quickly. Mr. President, you said you feel a kinship—you said you feel a kinship with Brett Kavanaugh, and you—Mr. President, really quickly, you said you felt a kinship with Brett Kavanaugh. You said that you also—that your false allegations that you feel like were made against you make you feel like you don't want to believe these women. What message do you think that——
The President. No, I didn't say that. Why do you say that?
Q. So please explain——
The President. Fake news.
Q. Please explain——
The President. Why—did I say that?
Q. Well, can you please explain then what you're—
The President. Excuse me.
Q. ——talking about in your own false allegations?
The President. And by the way, I think you do a very good job, but I didn't say that. I do watch you. And I think you do a very good job. But I didn't say that.
Senate Confirmation Hearings for Supreme Court Nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh 
Q. So could you explain what you meant?
The President. I said, exactly, ""I look forward to watching her."" I do want to hear what she says. And maybe she'll say—I could be convinced of anything. Maybe, if she'll say something—but in the meantime, I have to tell you, he's one of the highest quality human beings.
He's a tremendous man. He's a tremendous genius. He's a great intellect. He was, I believe, number one at Yale. Is that a correct statement? Number one in his class at Yale.
Q. So you don't feel a kinship with him?
The President. He was a great student in law. He was—you know, I've heard his name. I didn't know him. Didn't know him. Until this whole thing, I didn't know him. But I heard his name for 10 years.
And you know how I heard his name? Everybody was saying he should be on the Supreme Court. I said, ""Who is he?"" ""His name is Brett Kavanaugh. And he should be—he's the most brilliant person. He's the most brilliant lawyer."" They were talking about him on the Supreme Court 10 years ago. With all of that, I want to hear what she has to say. Okay?
Sexual Assault Allegations Against the President 
Q. But you said that you don't feel—but you said that you feel like there have been numerous false allegations against you and that because of that——
The President. Oh, I've had many false——
Q. ——you feel that you understand what he might be going through.
The President. I've had many false statements against me. And if the press would have reported it, I would have been very happy. I think John Roberts would tell you that.
Q. And——
The President. You covered the story where the women were paid to say bad things about me. Sean Hannity covered it. I will tell you, when I saw that on Sean Hannity, I actually called him. Believe it or not, I don't speak to him very much, but I respect him. I called him. I said: ""This is the biggest story. This is a big, big story."" He agreed with me. The next day, I picked up the papers. There wasn't one word about it. The next day, I watched ABC news, Jon. I watched NBC. I watched CBS. I didn't watch CNN, but next time, I'm going to. [Laughter]
Q. And are you okay with——
The President. I watched everything. There wasn't one story other than Fox. And it's a big story. It's a shame. Okay. Enough. Thank you, though.
Q. And is it okay if I give it to the New York Times?
The President. Thank you. Thank you.
Q. Is it okay if I give it to the New York Times, Mr. President?
The President. Go ahead. That's enough, please.
Q. I'm just going to ask. Okay.
The President. Good job. Good job.
Q. Mr. President, could I ask a question, since I am from the New York Times——
Q. Mr. President——
Q. ——before this gentleman?
The President. Since you're where? Since you're where?
Q. I'm actually from the New York Times. Yamiche is my former colleague, and we miss her. But I was hoping I could ask a question.
The President. I don't blame you. But I'll let you do it after he does it. Is that okay?
Q. That's perfectly well.
The President. I will do that in honor of a paper I once loved. [Laughter]
Q. Thank you.
The President. Go ahead.
Arab-Israeli Peace Process/Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel 
Q. Mr. President, my name is Edward Szall, with TruNews. Today you met with Bibi Netanyahu, from Israel. And you brought up, actually, that you support a two-state solution for the Palestinian-Israeli crisis there.
The President. I do.
Q. Can you give us any more preview of what this great deal, the peace deal with Palestinians?
The President. Well, I'd love to be able to make a deal with the Israelis and the Palestinians. You know, my whole life, I was told that's the toughest deal. And I disagree. I think health care is probably tougher, okay? You want to know the truth. But it is tough. But we're going to take care of that, too. And that's going to get taken care of. We've already taken care of a lot of it. But the whole—my life, I've always heard the deal between, as you know, Israel and the Palestinians, that's like the toughest deal. Every possible thing is tough about that. I think we're going to make a deal. I think we're going to make a deal.
So, at one of our many meetings today, I was with Bibi Netanyahu, a man who I have a lot of respect for. A man who has been extremely nice to me—very happy that I did the whole thing with Jerusalem and the Embassy, which, by the way, we're going to open in 4 months for less than $500,000. And the budget was over $1 billion, right?
Arab-Israeli Peace Process 
Q. Yes. That's correct.
The President. So we saved, let's say, a billion dollars. That's not so bad. And it's open. And it's beautiful, by the way. Jerusalem stone, one of my favorite stones. [Laughter]
I will tell you, the question—somebody said today, ""Well, this is the first news conference in a long time."" I said: ""What do you mean? I did like, five today."" [Laughter] Every time I sit, I take a lot of questions from people that are screaming like maniacs in the back of the room, meaning, reporters.
And one of the reporters—I won't say that it was John Roberts that said that, I refuse. [Laughter] But one of the—it was, but that's okay. Don't feel guilty, John. But of the reporters that was screaming asked about the one-state, two-state. And I said: ""I think the two-state will happen. I think it's, in one way, more difficult because it's a real estate deal, because you need metes and bounds, and you need lots of carve-outs and lots of everything. It's actually a little tougher deal. But in another way, it works better because you have people governing themselves and""——
Q. Yes.
The President. So they asked be about that. I said: ""Well, I think the two-state will happen. I think we're going to go down the two-state road."" And I'm glad I got it out. And Jared, who is so involved—he loves Israel. He loves Israel. But he's also going to be very fair with the Palestinians. He understands it takes two people to be happy, two groups of people to be happy. Everybody has got to be happy. And that's why it's so tough, because there's been so much hatred and anger for so many years. That's what, probably, the number-one ingredient of toughness is. But they asked me—I said I think it's going to be a two-state.
And you know what I did today? By saying that, I put it out there. And if you ask most of the people in Israel, they agree with that. But nobody wanted to say it. It's a big thing to put it out. It's a very big thing to put it out.
Now, the bottom line: If the Israelis and the Palestinians want one state, that's okay with me. If they want two states, that's okay with me. I'm happy if they're happy. I'm a facilitator. I want to see if I can get a deal done so that people don't get killed anymore.
When we had—in Saudi Arabia—we had one of the great conferences in history. Many of you were there; probably, all of you were there. It was one of the most beautiful 2 days. That, and China—two of the most incredible events I've ever seen—saw yet. I've never seen anything like it.
And we had, I believe, 58 Muslim countries—the leaders. The kings, the amirs, the absolute leaders from every—there was nobody in second place. They were the leaders of the whole thing. And unbeknownst to anybody else, people would come up to me, individually—it wasn't a setup. They'd come up to me and say, ""Sir, you can't have peace in the Middle East without peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians."" I said: ""Why? What difference? Why does that matter so much?"" They said, ""It just is impossible to make peace in the Middle East unless you have between the Israelis""——
So I heard that from one—the King of Saudi Arabia, who is a great guy—King Salman. And then, somebody else came up. And he wasn't told, ""Oh, go up and say it."" I know where they're coming from. And I must have had 12 leaders say it. And they just said it.
And I started to realize that peace between Israel and the Palestinians, for the Middle East, is a very important thing. And we're trying very hard to get it. I think, probably, two-state is more likely. But you know what? If they do a single, if they do a double, I'm okay with it if they're both happy. If they're both happy, I'm okay with either. I think the two-state is more likely.
Okay, how about one—go ahead.
Q. New York Times? New York Times?
The President. Oh, okay.
Q. Thank you, sir.
The President. I would have gotten bad story in the New York Times. But I will anyways, so I guess it doesn't matter.
Q. We're—we're kind of, uh——
The President. Okay, we'll do you after that.
Q. We're kind of, uh——
The President. And then, we'll call it quits.
Q. We're kind of thriving, not failing these days.
The President. You're doing very well.
Q. Yes.
The President. Say, ""Thank you, Mr. Trump."" [Laughter]
Q. [Laughter] I think I'll stop short of that. [Laughter]
The President. I wonder how you do—you know, all my life, I've had very few stories—but I've had some on the front page of the New York Times. Now, I think I think I average about three or four a day, right?
Q. That is——
The President. And of the three or four, they're all negative. No matter what I do, they're negative. But you know what? That's okay. I still love the paper.
Go ahead. [Laughter]
China/President Xi Jinping of China 
Q. I wanted to come back to China, because I think what you announced today was really important.
The President. I agree. Q. You talk about this friendship you have with Xi Jinping, and yet, essentially, what you did today is accused his Government——
The President. That's right.
Q. ——of interfering in our internal affairs——
The President. That's right.
Q. ——subverting our Democratic process, and doing it to hurt you, the Republican Party——
The President. Doing it to help them.
Q. ——and your backers.
The President. You know what? Yes. Doing it to help them.
Q. So how can a guy who does that be your friend?
The President. I think that we are able to—and maybe he's not anymore. I'll be honest with you, I think we had a very good friendship. I think we had a very good relationship; we understand each other. They are doing studies on Donald Trump. They're trying to figure it all out, because this has never happened to them before. It's never happened.
Think of it, you've never seen—you've covered very well—you've never seen this happen. They're having big problems. I don't want them to have problems, but they've got to make a fair deal. Just like Canada has got to make a fair deal.
I believe that he and I have a very good chemistry together. And I can tell you that about many leaders. I can also tell you a few where I don't feel I'll ever have a chemistry with them. I don't want to have a chemistry with them. And for those people, I'll have Pompeo, Nikki, Bolton, Jared. I can go—our General; I'll have our General. Or if they can't do it, I'll have Sarah Huckabee do it. Right?
But for the most part, I have very good—very good with Prime Minister Abe. Very good with President Moon. By the way, what President Moon said last night—I know you won't report it—but Bret Baier [Bret Baier, Fox News] interviewed him last night, and he asked him about me. I can't say—because you would say I'm too braggadocious—but what he said about me last night was an unbelievable thing. ""Couldn't have happened without President Trump, and it never would happen without President Trump. And nobody else could do it."" You know, I mean, you'll take a look.
But I will tell you, China is very special. Very special. They're incredible people. It's an incredible country. What they've done is unbelievable.
China 
Q. How would——
The President. And it all started with the WTO. It was a defective deal. And it all started—without the WTO, China is not China as we know it today. And then, it started also by—our people that are standing right in this position, that are in the Oval Office—another way of saying it—allowed them to get away with murder. Allowed a lot of countries to get away with murder.
I think we still probably have a very good relationship. But you know what? In honor of you, I will, tomorrow, make a call to him. Say, ""Hey, how you doing?"" Okay? Q. Can I—can I just ask——
The President. ""You don't mind paying billions of dollars a month in tariffs.""
China's Efforts To Influence 2018 Congressional Elections/U.S. Agriculture/North American Free Trade Agreement 
Q. I just had two small follow-ups. One is, how would you compare the level of interference you see today from the Chinese to what Russia did in 2016?
The President. Well, I think it's different. If you look at the Des Moines Register, I mean, they have ads that are made to look like editorials. Saying about: ""Oh, you've got to stop Trump. You've got to stop him. You've got to vote against him."" My farmers are so incredible. These are patriots.
You know, on a network that doesn't like me very much, which is most of them—but a network that didn't—doesn't really treat me very good, they interviewed farmers. And they got hurt because, you know, all of a sudden China stops buying.
By the way, they've started buying again. I don't know if you've noticed. And soybeans are going up, and things are going up. And we've had very little hurt from what I've done. In fact, the markets have gone up. And the farmers are going to do great.
But ultimately—but they had farmers, and these guys are amazing; I love them. And they voted for me, and they love me. And they said: ""We don't care if we get hurt. He's doing the right thing."" And you know, a lot of people—it's a complex game. A lot of people don't know exactly what it is. They don't know how to define ""tariff."" They don't know it is really different than a tax, although it's getting close.
But they know that for the first time in many, many years, they have a President that's fighting for them; that's not letting their jobs be taken to other countries; that's not allowing the kind of abuse that we—I mean, when you look at what happened, as an example, with NAFTA. And for years—because it was never changed—NAFTA was defective deal the day it was signed.
You know why? Because they had a VAT tax of 17 percent and nobody from this country knew that. And by the time they found out, which was about a week later, nobody went and changed it. So you went many years, and they never changed it. There was a VAT tax that Mexico got. So we were 17 or 16 points behind, before we even started. NAFTA was a horrible thing.
So the farmers and—by the way, the steel workers—you know, I stopped the dumping. The dumping was horrible. And now if they want to dump, that's okay, but they've got to pay the United States of America 25 percent on everything they dump. That's okay. But as I told you before, steel is doing phenomenally well.
But the farmers say, ""This man is fighting for us. No President has ever fought for us before."" And you really have to study what's happened over the 15 years with the farmers. The farmers have been decimated over a 15-year period. They've been decimated. The farmers are going to come out great. These are great people. They're great, great patriots.
I think we should finish with that one. Is that okay?
[Several reporters shouted questions.]
The President. Okay. Go ahead. Let's go. Fast. Musician Elton John 
Q. Sure.
The President. I always like—always like to finish with a good one.
Elton John said, ""When you hit that last tune, and it's good, don't go back."" [Laughter]
Q. Let me ask you——
The President. I've seen—have you ever seen? They do great. They're great. They hit the last tune, and everyone goes crazy. Then, they go back for an encore, right? And they don't hit it. And they leave—everyone leaves. They said, ""That wasn't a very good concert, was it?""
Let's go.
Men Accused of Sexual Assault/Senate Confirmation Hearings for Supreme Court Nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh 
Q. Well, I'll ask you one final question——
The President. You—don't make me wrong. Go ahead.
Q. ——ahead of tomorrow's hearing. Because you were asked earlier in the news conference about Brett——
The President. Say it again. Say it again.
Q. About the hearing tomorrow.
The President. Yes.
Q. You were asked earlier in the news conference by my friend from Sky News about the message that you are sending to——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——the women of the country.
The President. Right.
Q. What about the message that you may be sending to young men? You're a father. What does this moment that we're in—the cultural moment——
The President. It's a very big cultural moment.
Q. Right. So what message do you have for young men of America?
The President. It's a very big—it's also—you're right. I think it's a great question.
This is a very big moment for our country, because you have a man who is very outstanding, but he's got very strong charges against him—probably charges that nobody is going to be able be—to prove.
So I could have you chosen for a position. I could have you or you or you—anybody. And somebody could say things. And it's happened to me many times, where false statements are made. And honestly, nobody knows who to believe.
I could pick another Supreme Court judge—Justice. I could pick another one, another one, another one. This could go on forever. Somebody could come and say: ""Thirty years ago, twenty-five years ago, ten years ago, five years ago, he did a horrible thing to me. He did this. He did that. He did that.""
And honestly, it's a very dangerous period in our country. And it's being perpetrated by some very evil people. Some of them are Democrats, I must say. Because some of them know that this is just a game that they're playing. It's a con game. It's at the highest level. We're talking about the United States Supreme Court.
This can go on forever. I can pick five other people. At a certain point, the people are going to say, ""No, thank you."" This is the most coveted job, probably, in the world.
And you know what? I would honestly say—because I interviewed great people for this job. He's great, but I interviewed other great people for this job. I could conceivably imagine going to one of them and saying: ""It's too bad what happened to this wonderful man, but I'm going to choose you, number two. I want you to go."" And I could conceivably be turned down by somebody that desperately wanted this job 2 months ago.
Q. But, with respect, sir——
The President. So this is—this is—and this is beyond Supreme Court.
Q. Right.
The President. There's nothing beyond Supreme Court; this is beyond Supreme Court. This has everything to do with our country.
When you are guilty until proven innocent, it's just not supposed to be that way. Always I heard, ""You're innocent until proven guilty."" I've heard this for so long, and it's such a beautiful phrase. In this case, you're guilty until proven innocent. I think that is a very, very dangerous standard for our country.
With that being said, I look forward to what she has to say. I also look very forward to what Judge Kavanaugh has to say. I think it's going to be a very, very important day in the history of our country.
Q. And——
The President. I want to thank you all. We'll do it again.
Q. Sir, the message to young men? Sir?
The President. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Q. Young men? Young teenage men? Nothing to say, sir?"

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/332760",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-washington-dc,"The President. Thank you. Thank you very much. Please, thank you.
It was a big day yesterday, an incredible day. And last night the Republican Party defied history to expand our Senate majority while significantly beating expectations in the House for the midtown—and midterm year. We did this in spite of a very dramatic fundraising disadvantage driven by Democrats' wealthy donors and special interests and very hostile media coverage, to put it mildly. The media coverage set a new record and a new standard.
We also had a staggering number of House retirements. So it's a little tough. These are seats that could've been held pretty easily, and we had newcomers going in, and a lot of them worked very hard. But it's very difficult when you have that many retirements.
We held a large number of campaign rallies with large, large numbers of people going to every one—to the best of my knowledge, we didn't have a vacant or an empty seat; I'm sure you would have reported it if you spotted one—including 30 rallies in the last 60 days. And we saw the candidates that I supported achieve tremendous success last night.
As an example, of the 11 candidates we campaigned with during the last week, 9 won last night. This vigorous campaigning stopped the blue wave that they talked about. I don't know if there ever was such a thing, but could've been. If we didn't do the campaigning, probably, there could've been. And the history really will see what a good job we did in the final couple of weeks in terms of getting some tremendous people over the finish line. They really are tremendous people, but many of them were not known. But they will be known.
This election marks the largest Senate gains for a President's party in a first midterm election since at least President Kennedy's in 1962. There have been only four midterm elections since 1934 in which a President's party has gained even a single Senate seat. As of now, we picked up, it looks like, three. Could be four. Perhaps it could be two. But we picked up a lot. And most likely, the number will be three. You people probably know that better than I do at this point, because you've looked at the more recent numbers.
Fifty-five is the largest number of Republican Senators in the last 100 years. In the last 80 years, a sitting President's party has only gained a cumulative total of eight Senate seats, averaging one per decade. So if we picked up two, three, or four, that's a big percentage of that number. So in the last 80 years—you think of that—only eight seats.
In President Obama's first midterm election, he lost six Senate seats, including in the deep-blue State of Massachusetts. Republicans captured at least four Senate seats held by Democrat incumbents. And these are tremendously talented, hard-working people that did this: Indiana, North Dakota, Florida, Missouri. We also won two open Senate seats in Tennessee—I want to congratulate our great champion who did such a great job in Tennessee, Marsha—and in Utah. And Arizona is looking very good. Really, very good. She's done a terrific job. That was a tough race, and she's done a fantastic job.
In each of these open seats, Democrats recruited very strong candidates with substantial fundraising and media support. We were getting bombarded with money on the other side. In the House, Republicans dramatically outperformed historical precedence and overcame a historic number of retirements, the most House Republican retirements in 88 years; 43 House Republicans retired.
Now, I will say this—that, in many cases, they were chairmen of committees, and they left because they weren't chairmen, because the Republicans have a rule—for 6 years. And what that does is wonderful in one way; it lets people come through the system and become chairman. And in another way, it drives people out. Because when they're a chairman, they don't want to go and not be a chairman. You're the chairman of a committee, and you're a big deal, and all of a sudden, you're not doing that anymore. So they leave. We had a lot of them leave. It's—I guess you can flip a coin as to which system is better. The Democrats do the other. Some of their folks have been on these committees for a long time as chairman.
In 2010, President Obama's first midterm, he lost 63 seats. By contrast, as of the most current count, it looks like around 27 House seats or something. And we'll figure that out pretty soon.
We also had a slew of historic wins in the Governors' races—the Governors' races were incredible—against very well-funded, talented, and skilled Democrat candidates and people that worked very, very hard, respectfully, for those candidates, like Oprah Winfrey, who I like. [Laughter] I don't know if she likes me anymore, but that's okay. She used to. But she worked very hard in Georgia. Very, very hard.
And if you look at them, we have four Governors' races crucial to 2020 and the Presidential race: Florida, Iowa, Ohio, and Georgia. The big ones: Florida, Iowa, Ohio, and Georgia. Can't get much more important than that. They were incredible. They were actually incredible campaigns too. Incredible.
As of right now, Republicans will control the majority of Governorships across the country, including three great women who worked very hard: the Governors of Alabama, South Dakota, and Iowa. They worked very, very hard. And they're very talented.
By expanding our Senate majority, the voters have also clearly rebuked the Senate Democrats for their handling of the Kavanaugh hearings. That was a factor, I think maybe a very big factor. The way that was handled, I think, was—tremendous energy was given to the Republican Party by the way they treated then-Judge Kavanaugh, now Justice Kavanaugh. And expressed their support for confirming more great pro-Constitution judges.
Candidates who embraced our message of low taxes, low regulations, low crime, strong borders, and great judges excelled last night. They excelled. They really—I mean, we have a list of people that were fantastic, and I'm just going to point them out: Mike Bost; Rodney Davis; Andy Barr was fantastic. I went to Kentucky—for the most part, I didn't campaign for the House, but I did actually make a special trip for Andy Barr because he was in a very tough race in Kentucky, and he won. That was a very tough race. The polls were all showing that he was down and down substantially. And he won. And that one I did do. Pete Stauber of Minnesota, great guy; he's new and ran a fantastic race.
On the other hand, you had some that decided to ""let's stay away."" ""Let's stay away."" They did very poorly. I'm not sure that I should be happy or sad, but I feel just fine about it. Carlos Curbelo; Mike Coffman—too bad, Mike. [Laughter] Mia Love. I saw Mia Love. She'd call me all the time to help her with a hostage situation, being held hostage in Venezuela. But Mia Love gave me no love—[laughter]—and she lost. Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia. [Laughter] And Barbara Comstock was another one. I mean, I think she could have won that race, but she didn't want to have any embrace. For that, I don't blame her. But she lost, substantially lost. Peter Roskam didn't want the embrace. Erik Paulsen didn't want the embrace. And in New Jersey, I think he could have done well, but didn't work out too good. Bob Hugin, I feel badly because I think that's something that could have been won. That's a race that could have been won. John Faso.
Those are some of the people that, you know, decided for their own reason not to embrace, whether it's me or what we stand for. But what we stand for meant a lot to most people. And we've had tremendous support and tremendous support in the Republican Party. Among the biggest support in the history of the party. I've actually heard, at 93 percent, it's a record. But I won't say that, because who knows. But we've had tremendous support.
America is booming like never before, doing fantastic. We have Larry Kudlow here, and he said the numbers are as good as he's ever seen—numbers—at any time for our country. But he's a young man, so he hasn't seen that many numbers. [Laughter] Where's Larry? You're a young man, right, Larry? And you haven't been doing this too long, but they're as good as you've ever seen. And we may have—if you have a question for Larry, we'll do that.
But I want to send my warmest appreciation in regards to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. We really worked very well together. We have been working very well together. We actually have a great relationship. People just don't understand that, which is fine.
And also to, perhaps—it looks like, I would think—Speaker Nancy Pelosi. And I give her a lot of credit. She works very hard, and she's worked long and hard. I give her a great deal of credit for what she's done and what she's accomplished.
Hopefully, we can all work together next year to continue delivering for the American people, including on economic growth, infrastructure, trade, lowering the cost of prescription drugs. These are some of things that the Democrats do want to work on, and I really believe we'll be able to do that. I think we're going to have a lot of reason to do it.
And I will say, just as a matter of business, I was with some very successful people last night. We were watching the returns. So if the Republicans won—and let's say we held on by two or one or three—it would've been very hard out of that many Republicans to ever even get support among Republicans, because there will always be one or two or three people that, for a good reason or for a bad reason or for grandstanding—we have that too; you've seen that. You've seen that. Plenty of grandstanding. But for certain reasons, that many people, you're always going to have a couple that won't do it. So that puts us in a very bad position.
In other words, had we kept it, and this is no—I'm saying this for a very basic reason; it's common sense—it puts us in a very tough position. We win by one or two or three, and you'll have one or two or three or four or five, even, come over and say, you know: ""Look, we're not going to along with this. We want this, this, this."" And all of a sudden, we can't even—we wouldn't even be able to get it, in many cases, out of the Republicans' hands before we sent it on to the Senate.
And now we have a much easier path, because the Democrats will come to us with a plan for infrastructure, a plan for health care, a plan for whatever they are looking at, and we'll negotiate. And as you know, it's been very hard in the Senate, because we need, essentially, 10 votes from Democrats, and we don't get those votes. Because the Democrats do really stick together well. I don't agree with them on a lot of policy, but I agree with them on sticking together. They stick together great. So now we go into the Senate. We don't have the 10 votes. And what happens? It doesn't get passed. Even if it gets out of the House, it doesn't get passed. So under the new concept of what we're doing, I say: ""Come on. Let me see what you have."" They want to do things. You know, I keep hearing about investigations fatigue. Like from the time—almost from the time I announced I was going to run, they've been giving us this investigation fatigue. It's been a long time. They've got nothing. Zero. You know why? Because there is nothing.
But they can play that game, but we can play it better. Because we have a thing called the United States Senate. And a lot of very questionable things were done between leaks of classified information and many other elements that should not have taken place. And all you're going to do is end up in back and forth and back and forth. And 2 years is going to go up, and we won't have done a thing.
I really think, and I really respected what Nancy said last night about bipartisanship and getting together and uniting. She used the word ""uniting"" and she used the bipartisanship statement, which is so important, because that's what we should be doing. So we can look at us, they can look at us, and then we can look at them, and it'll go back and forth. And it'll probably be very good for me politically. I could see it being extremely good politically, because I think I'm better at that game than they are, actually. [Laughter]
But we'll find out. I mean, you know, we'll find out. Or we can work together. You can't do them simultaneously, by the way. Just think if somebody said, ""Oh, you can do them both."" No, you can't. Because if they're doing that, we're not doing the other, just so you understand. So we won't be doing that.
But now what happens is, we send it to the Senate, and we'll get a hundred-percent Democrat support, and we'll get some Republican support. And if it's good, I really believe we have Republicans that will help with the approval process, and they will really help with the approval process.
So it really could be a beautiful bipartisan type of situation. If we won by one or two or three or four or five, that wouldn't happen. And the closer it is, the worse it is. This way, they'll come to me, we'll negotiate. Maybe we'll make a deal, maybe we won't. That's possible. But we have a lot of things in common on infrastructure.
We want to do something on health care; they want to do something on health care. There are a lot of great things that we can do together. And now we'll send it up, and we will really get—we'll get the Democrats, and we'll get the Republicans, or some of the Republicans. And I'll make sure that we send something up that the Republicans can support, and they're going to want to make sure they send something up that the Democrats can support.
So our great country is booming like never before, and we're thriving on every single level, both in terms of economic and military strength; in terms of development. In terms of GDP, we're doing unbelievably.
I will tell you, our trade deals are coming along fantastically. The USMCA and South Korea is finished. USMCA has gotten rave reviews. Not going to lose companies anymore to other countries. They're not going to do that, because they have a tremendous economic incentive; it's—meaning, it's prohibitive for them to do that. So it's not going to be like NAFTA, which is one of the worst deals I've ever seen—although we've made some other pretty bad ones too. Now is the time for members of both parties to join together, put partisanship aside, and keep the American economic miracle going strong. It is a miracle. We're doing so well. And I've said it at a lot of rallies. Some of you have probably heard it so much you don't want to hear it again. But when people come to my office—Presidents, Prime Ministers—they all congratulate me, almost the first thing, on what we've done economically. Because it is really amazing.
And our steel industry is back. Our aluminum industry is starting to do really well. These are industries that were dead. Our miners are working again.
We must all work together to protect our military—we have to do that—to support our law enforcement, secure our borders, and advance really great policy, including environmental policy. We want crystal-clean water. We want beautiful, perfect air. Air and water, it has to be perfect.
At the same time, we don't want to put ourselves at a disadvantage to other countries who are very competitive with us and who don't abide by the rules at all. We don't want to hurt our jobs. We don't want to hurt our factories. We don't want companies leaving. We want to be totally competitive, and we are.
And right now we have just about the cleanest air, the cleanest water we've ever had, and it's always going to be that way. We insist on it. So environmental is very important to me.
And with that, I'll take a few questions if you'd like. Whoa. [Laughter] I didn't know what happened.
All right, go ahead, John [John Roberts, Fox News].
That was a lot of hands shooting up so quickly. [Laughter]
Q. There's a lot to talk about.
The President. There's a lot to talk about.
2018 Congressional Elections/Bipartisanship 
Q. Mr. President, you talked at length just now about bipartisanship. The presumed Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, talked about it last night. I'm sure that's encouraging for the American people. But do you really believe, given what the relationship has been like between this White House and the Democratic Party, that that will happen? Will——
The President. I think there's a good chance, John. I think there's a very good chance that it——
Q. If I could just finish, sir.
The President. ——will happen.
Q. Will you have to compromise on certain issues to the point where it could hurt you in 2020? And do you expect that when the Democrats take over the chairmanship of all these important committees, you're going to get hit with a blizzard of subpoenas on everything from the Russia investigation——
The President. Well, then everything is going to come—okay.
Q. ——to your cell phone use, to your tax returns? The President. Ready? Then, you're going to—if that happens, then we're going to do the same thing, and Government comes to a halt. And I would blame them, because they now are going to be coming up with policy. They're the majority in the House.
I expect that they will come up with some fantastic ideas that I can support on the environment, on so many different things, including prescription drug prices, which we've made a big dent in already, including some of the things that we're working on for the vets. We've gotten choice approved. We've gotten a lot of things approved. But they have some other elements that we want.
There are many things we can get along on without a lot of trouble; that we agree very much with them and they agree with us. I would like to see bipartisanship. I'd like to see unity. And I think we have a very good chance of—and maybe not on everything—but I think we have a very good chance of seeing that.
Go ahead.
Border Security 
Q. One question on the lame duck, sir, and one on your Cabinet. You toyed with the idea during the campaign of a shutdown before the midterms in order to secure border wall funding. Are you prepared to go on a shutdown strategy during the lame duck, since this might be your last, best chance——
The President. Not necessarily my last chance.
Q. ——to secure that?
The President. Look, I speak to Democrats all the time. They agree that a wall is necessary. A wall is necessary. And as you know, we're building the wall. We've started. But we should build it at one time, not in chunks.
Q. But you want much more money, and you want it much sooner.
The President. No, we need the money to build the wall—the whole wall—not pieces of it all over. And we are doing it. Now we have the military. Now we have other elements of a wall that are pretty nasty, to be honest with you. But it's—nevertheless, it's pretty hard to get through it.
But no, I'd like to see the wall. Many of the people that we'll be dealing with, you know, in 2006, they approved the wall, essentially. It was a very strong border fence, but it was the same thing. And they all approved it; they all agreed. I have statements from every one of them. We have them saying, ""We need the wall."" I mean, they sound like me.
But we do need it, because we have people coming—and I'm not just talking about the caravans. We have people coming through our border that you physically can't put that many people. It's a 2,000-mile stretch. You can't put that many people along that stretch to guard it. And even if you did, tremendous fighting would ensue.
So we need the wall. Many Democrats know we need the wall. And we're just going to have to see what happens. I mean, I will be fighting for it. They have done everything in their power to make sure we're—I got the military $700 billion and $716 billion. The wall is a tiny, tiny fraction of the cost of that. But their whole agenda has been to try not giving me anything for the wall. I really believe, politically, they're hurting themselves. I actually think, politically, that's a good thing for me. But I want to get the wall up because we need it for security.
Potential Federal Government Shutdown 
Q. So no shutdown scenario for the mid—for the lame duck?
The President. I don't know. I can't tell you that. No, I can't commit to that, but it's possible.
The President's Cabinet 
Q. And can you give us clarity, sir, on your thinking currently now, after the midterms, about your Attorney General and your Deputy Attorney General? Do they have long-term job security?
The President. I'd rather answer that at a little bit different time. We're looking at a lot of different things, including Cabinet. I'm very happy with most of my Cabinet. We're looking at different people for different positions. You know, it's very common after the midterms. I didn't want to do anything before the midterms.
But I will tell you that, for the most part, I'm extremely happy with my Cabinet. I think Mike Pompeo has fit in so beautifully. He's done an incredible job as——
Secretary of the Interior Ryan K. Zinke 
Q. How about your Interior Secretary?
The President. We're looking at that, and I want—I do want to study whatever is being said. I think he's doing——
Q. Is he in jeopardy?
The President. I think he's doing an excellent job, but we will take a look at that in a very strong—and we'll probably have an idea about that in about a week.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Okay? Thank you.
Wow, this is—go ahead, Jon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News]. He gave me a fair interview the other day, so I might as well ask him a question.
The President's Tax Returns 
Q. All right, thank you, Mr. President. And picking up there, you told me the other day that you are an ""open book."" So——
The President. I think I am an open book. [Laughter]
Q. So point blank, Democrats go after your tax returns, will you try to block that or will you allow them to have them?
The President. Well, look, as I have told you, they're under audit. They have been for a long time. They're extremely complex. People wouldn't understand them. They're done by among the biggest and best law firms in the country. Same thing with the accounting firms. The accountants are—a very, very large, powerful firm, from the standpoint of respect. They're highly respected, big firm. A great law firm. Or you know it very well. They do these things; they put them in. But people don't understand tax returns. Now, I did do a filing of over a hundred pages, I believe, which is in the offices. And when people went and saw that filing and they saw the magnitude of it, they were very disappointed. And they saw the—you know, the detail. You'd get far more from that. And I guess we filed that now three times. But you get far more from that than you could ever get from a tax return.
But when you're under audit—and I'm on a very continuous audit, because there are so many companies, and it is a very big company—far bigger than you would even understand. But it's a great company, but it's big, and it's complex. And it's probably feet high. It's a very complex instrument.
And I think that people wouldn't understand it. But if I were finished with the audit, I would have an open mind to it. I would say that. But I don't want to do it during the audit. And really, no lawyer—even from the other side, they say often—not always—but when you're under audit, you don't have—you don't subject it to that. You get it done, and then you release it.
So when that happens, if that happens, I would certainly have an open mind to it.
Q. So that means that if the audit is still on, you will not turn over the tax returns, or you'll fight to block it?
The President. When it's under audit—no, nobody would. Nobody turns over a return when it's under audit, okay?
Q. Thank you.
The President. Thank you. Yes, go ahead. Please.
Talk Show Host and Actor Oprah Winfrey 
Q. One, I was tempted to ask you why you like Oprah so much, but I think I'll go on to the question that——
The President. Why do I like Oprah? [Laughter] What kind of a question is that?
Q. I'm just asking. Just curious. But the real question——
The President. He's a comedian here.
Q. The real question is——
The President. I do like Oprah, by the way. I do. She was a person I knew well. Came to my place in Palm Beach often. And I have a lot of respect for her. Unfortunately, she didn't do the trick.
The President's Relationship With Congressional Democrats 
Q. The real question is, you just said up here, and said that—from this podium, that it's—are you offering a my-way-or-highway scenario to the Democrats? You're saying——
The President. No. Negotiation. Not at all.
Q. ——that if they start investigating you, that you can play that game and investigate them.
The President. Oh, yes. Better than them.
Q. Can you compartmentalize that——
The President. And I think I know more than they know. Q. Can you compartmentalize that and still continue to work with them for the benefit of the rest of the country? Are you, or——
The President. No.
Q. Are all bets off?
The President. No. If they do that, then it's just—all it is, is a warlike posture.
Yes, go ahead.
Q. And so then the—wait a minute, then the follow-up then——
The President. You heard my answer. Go ahead.
Q. Well, since it's Jim [Jim Acosta, CNN], I'll let it go.
Border Security/Immigration 
Q. Okay. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to challenge you on one of the statements that you made in the tail end of the campaign in the midterms, that this——
The President. Here we go.
Q. Well, if you don't mind, Mr. President——
The President. Let's go. Let's go. Come on.
Q. That this caravan was an ""invasion."" As you know, Mr. President——
The President. I consider it to be an invasion.
Q. As you know, Mr. President, the caravan was not an invasion. It's a group of migrants moving up from Central America towards the border with the U.S.
The President. Thank you for telling me that. I appreciate it. [Laughter]
Q. Why did you characterize it as such? And——
The President. Because I consider it an invasion. You and I have a difference of opinion.
Q. But do you think that you demonized immigrants in this election——
The President. Not at all. No, not at all.
Q. ——to try to keep——
The President. I want them to come into the country, but they have to come in legally. You know, they have to come in, Jim, through a process. I want it to be a process.
And I want people to come in. And we need the people.
Q. Right. But your campaign had—your campaign——
The President. Wait. Wait. Wait. You know why we need the people, don't you? Because we have hundreds of companies moving in. We need the people.
Q. Right. But your campaign had an ad showing migrants climbing over walls and so on. It——
The President. Well, that's true. They weren't actors.
Q. They're not going to be doing that. The President. They weren't actors. Well, no, it was true. Do you think they were actors? I—they weren't actors. They didn't come from Hollywood. These were—these were people—this was an actual—you know, it happened a few days ago. And——
Q. They're hundreds of miles away though. They're hundreds and hundreds of miles away.
The President. You know what?
Q. That's not an invasion.
The President. I think you should—honestly, I think you should let me run the country, you run CNN——
Q. All right.
The President. ——and if you did it well, your ratings would be much better.
Q. But let me ask, if I may ask one other question——
The President. Okay, that's enough.
Q. Mr. President, if I may ask one other question.
The President. Okay, Peter [Peter Alexander, NBC News], go ahead.
[At this point, CNN Chief White House Correspondent Jim Acosta continued to address the President.]
Q. Are you worried——
The President. That's enough. That's enough. That's enough.
Q. Mr. President, I didn't—well, I was going to ask one other. The other folks that had——
The President. That's enough. That's enough.
[A White House aide attempted to take the microphone from Mr. Acosta, who continued to speak as follows.]
Q. Pardon me, ma'am, I'm—Mr. President——
The President. Excuse me, that's enough.
Q. Mr. President, I had one other question if——
The President. Peter, let's go.
Investigation Into Russia's Efforts To Influence 2016 Presidential Election 
[Mr. Acosta continued to address the President.]
Q. ——I may ask on the Russia investigation. Are you concerned that you may have indictments——
The President. I'm not concerned about anything with the Russia investigation, because it's a hoax.
Q. ——that you may indictments coming down? Are you——
The President. That's enough. Put down the mike.
Q. Mr. President, are you worried about indictments coming down in this investigation? [Other reporters began asking questions.]
Q. Mr. President——
Q. Would you take the question——
The President. I'll tell you what: CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them. You are a rude, terrible person. You shouldn't be working for CNN.
Go ahead.
[NBC News National Correspondent Peter Alexander began to address the President.]
Q. I think that's unfair. I've worked——
[The President addressed Mr. Acosta as follows.]
The President. You're a very rude person. The way you treat Sarah Huckabee is horrible. And the way you treat other people are horrible. You shouldn't treat people that way.
Go ahead. Go ahead, Peter. Go ahead.
Q. In Jim's defense, I've traveled with him and watched him. He's a diligent reporter who busts his butt like the rest of us.
The President. Well, I'm not a big fan of yours either. So you know. [Laughter]
Q. I understand.
The President. To be honest with you.
Q. So let me ask you a question if I can——
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. You aren't. You aren't the best.
Q. You repeatedly said—Mr. President, you repeatedly—over the course of the——
News Media 
[Mr. Acosta stood up and addressed the President as follows.]
Q. [Inaudible]—called the enemy of the people——
The President. Okay, just sit down, please.
Q. [Inaudible]—campaign—[inaudible]—and sent pipe bombs. T","hat's just—[inaudible].
The President. Well, when you report fake news——
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. No. When you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people.
Go ahead.
[Mr. Acosta continued to address the President off mike, and Mr. Alexander continued as follows.]
Democratic Party/Border Security/2018 Congressional Elections Q. Mr. President, over the course of the last several days of the campaign, sir—sir, at the end of the campaign, you repeatedly said that Americans need to fear Democrats. You said Democrats would ""unleash a wave of violent crime that endangers families everywhere."" Why are you pitting Americans——
The President. Because they're very weak on crime.
Q. ——why are you pitting Americans against one another, sir?
The President. Excuse me. Peter. Peter, what, are you trying to be him?
Q. No, I'm just asking the question.
The President. Peter, just let me just—let me just tell you, very simple: Because they're very weak on crime. Because they have often suggested—members and people within the Democrat Party, at a high level—have suggested getting rid of ICE, getting rid of law enforcement. That's not going to happen, okay?
We want to be strong on the borders. We want to be strong on law enforcement. And I want to cherish ICE because ICE does a fantastic job.
Q. So——
The President. The—what they do for us is so—really, it's so unrecognized how good a job they do.
So we want to take care of them, and we want to hold them very close because they do a good job.
Q. But the question, to be clear——
The President. Okay, yes, go ahead.
Q. ——to be clear, though, the question, sir, is, why are you——
The President. Thank you very much. Sit. Sit down, Peter.
Q. ——but the question—but you didn't answer my question. Just very simply, the question is, why are you pitting Americans against one another, sir?
The President. I'm not.
Q. Is that how you view citizens of this country?
The President. No, I'm not. Well, look, I'll tell you what: We won a lot of elections last night. We did very well last night, and I think it's going to have——
Q. But in many ways, it divided the country.
The President. I think it's going to have a very positive impact. I watched NBC this morning; they didn't report it exactly correctly, but that's, you know, very, very—that's the fact with NBC. Nothing I can do about that.
But I want this country to have protection. We want security in our country. I want security, Peter. I mean, you maybe don't think it's so important. And I think when you don't have it, you are indeed unleashing crime. I feel that.
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Birthright Citizenship Q. You said you would sign an Executive order on birthright citizenship. Are you still going to sign the Executive order on birthright citizenship?
The President. You will answer—you'll ask me that question a little bit later.
Go ahead.
Q. Okay.
The President. Go ahead. Sure.
Investigation Into Russia's Interference in 2016 Presidential Election 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. The investigation by the Special Counsel, Robert Mueller, has been going on since last spring. It's been over——
The President. It's been a long time.
Q. Yes, it's been over your head, over Republicans' head during the midterms as well. Is this an opportunity for you, Mr. President, to end that investigation? Would you consider removing Mr. Mueller from his position?
The President. I could have ended it anytime I wanted. I didn't. And there was no collusion. There was no anything. I didn't.
They went after hackers in Moscow. I don't know about that. They went after people with tax problems, from years ago. They went after people with loans and other things. Had nothing to do with my campaign.
This is a investigation where many, many millions of dollars has been spent. And there's no collusion. It was supposed to be on collusion. There's no collusion. And I think it's very bad for our country, I will tell you. I think it's a shame.
And a poll came out today—by the way, from NBC—or at least, I saw it on NBC—where a majority of the people do not agree with the Mueller investigation, or it wasn't approved. They have approval and disapproval, and it had a much higher disapproval.
It should end, because it's very bad for our country. It's——
Q. So if it's bad——
The President. And I'm not just talking about the tremendous expense. And the other thing is, they should look at the other side also. They only look at one side. They're not looking at all of the things that came up during this investigation. They don't do that.
They should also get people that can be fair, not 13 or 14 or 17, I call them the ""Angry Democrats."" They are angry people. And it's a very unfair thing for this country. It's a very, very—forget about unfair to me; it's very bad for our country.
Q. So, Mr. President, if it's——
The President. Go ahead. No, no, no. Please.
Q. Mr. President, just to make the point—if it's unfair to the country and it's costing millions of dollars, why don't you just end it?
The President. Give him the mike, please. I've answered the question.
Q. Okay. The President. Go ahead, take the—take the mike.
Voter Suppression 
Q. Voter suppression—Mr. President, voter suppression.
The President. Well, I'll give you voter—I will give you voter suppression. You just have to—sit down, please.
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. Sit down. I didn't call you. I didn't call you. I didn't call you.
I'll give you voter suppression: Take a look at the CNN polls, how inaccurate they were. That's called voter suppression.
Go ahead, please.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
Q. In Georgia, sir? In Georgia?
The President. I'm not responding. I'm responding to——
Q. Can you respond to my question?
The President. Excuse me, I'm not responding to you. I'm talking to this gentleman. Will you please sit down?
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. Would——
Q. [Inaudible]—but you said—[inaudible].
The President. Excuse me. Excuse me. Would you please sit down?
Please, go ahead.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President, now that the—now that the House of Representatives has——
The President. Very hostile. It's such a hostile media. It's so sad. You ask me about——
Q. I'm asking a question.
The President. No. You rudely interrupted him.
Q. You responded—[inaudible]—sir.
The President. You rudely interrupted him.
Go ahead.
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Do your demands remain the same to the United States Congress on immigration in exchange for a DACA fix? In exchange for an amnesty for 1.7 million, are you willing to change any of those demands that you gave to Congress earlier?
The President. I think we could really do something having to do with DACA. And what really happened with DACA—we could have done some pretty good work on DACA. But a judge ruled that DACA was okay. Had the judge not ruled that way, I think we would have made a deal. Once the judge ruled that way, the Democrats didn't want to talk anymore. So it'll see—we'll see how it works out at the Supreme Court.
Q. Do you still——
The President. Go ahead.
Q. Sir, can you take a question from the international media?
The President. From where?
Q. From the international media.
The President. Yes, go ahead. Go ahead.
Q. Afghanistan, Mr. President. Afghanistan is the priority——
The President. Go ahead. Which group? Where do you want me to take a question from? Go ahead, ma'am. Go ahead. Take the——
Either one. Either one.
Q. Okay. [Laughter]
Q. Both?
The President. Or both. Are you together? Go ahead.
2018 Congressional Elections 
Q. We're not together. Mr. President, how do you respond to critics who say that your message on the campaign towards minorities have been polarizing?
The President. I don't think it has been at all.
Q. But is the election of two Muslim women—one of them is veiled—to the House, which is making history, is this a rebuke of this message, do you think?
The President. I don't understand what you're saying to me. What?
Unemployment Rate for Racial and Ethnic Minorities/The President's Support Among African Americans and Hispanic Americans 
Q. Is it a rebuke of this message? Do you think that this is more reflective of multiethnic and multicultural America?
The President. Well, that question—I can only say this: If you look at the employment and unemployment numbers for African Americans, for Asian Americans, for Hispanic Americans, they're at a historic high. A poll came out recently where my numbers with Hispanics and with African Americans are the highest—the best they've ever been. That had—that took place 2 or 3 days ago, the poll.
I have the best numbers with African American and Hispanic American that I've ever had before. And you saw the same poll. So I can say that. I can say this: You look at median income, you look at all of the employment and unemployment numbers, they're doing the best they've ever done. And it reflects—it really is very reflective in the polls.
Yes, go ahead.
Q. Mr. President, I'm from Brooklyn, so you'll understand me. The President. Yes. I understand you very well.
Health Care Reform 
Q. My question is on health care. How is it possible to keep premiums down and cover preexisting conditions without the individual mandate to fund it?
The President. Well, first of all, what we're doing—and we're—if you look at the Department of Labor also—Secretary separately—Secretary Azar, what they've done. They've come up with some incredible health care plans, which is causing great competition and driving the prices right down.
But we are getting rid of the individual mandate, because it was very unfair to a lot of people. But at the same time, we're covering the people that need it. But the individual mandate was a disaster, because people that couldn't necessarily afford it were having to pay for the privilege of not having to pay for health care. And it was bad health care at that.
Q. But——
The President. So we are working many plans for health care. We're creating tremendous competition. We had Obamacare repealed and replaced. Unfortunately, one person changed his mind at the last moment. And we had no Democrat support. I have to say that. We didn't have one vote. We would have repealed it, replaced it. We would have had a large-scale, very good health care plan. Now we're doing it a different way. We're doing it a different way.
But getting rid of the individual mandate is a very, very popular thing and a very important thing. And people very much appreciate it.
Go ahead.
Q. [Inaudible]—from India.
The President. No, no. That's enough.
Go ahead, please.
2018 Congressional Elections 
Q. Thank you, sir. Two questions: One, I know you went through the results, and you obviously studied them late last night. What lesson did you learn most from looking at those results? Was there one thing that, as you kind of reviewed them, that you'll change your strategy not just for Congress, but kind of going forward?
And then just a follow-up question, sir.
The President. Well, I think the results that I've learned, and maybe confirm, I think people like me. I think people like the job I'm doing, frankly. Because if you look at every place I went to do a rally, I couldn't do it with everybody. But—and it was very hard to do it with people in Congress because there are just too many—it will be too many stops.
But I did it with the Senate. I did it with Andy Barr, as you know. And he won. He won a very tough race against McGrath. That was a very, very tough race in Kentucky, and he was down quite a bit. And I went there, and we had a tremendous, very successful—some of you were at that rally. And he won that race. But I could only do that so much, because there are just so many players involved. But I did focus on the Senate, and we had tremendous success with the Senate. Really tremendous success.
2020 Presidential Election 
Q. Can I ask you one more—one more question. Sorry, sir. Mr. President, one more question, if you don't mind. I'm so sorry, sir. It's a rare opportunity. [Laughter]
A lot of people are going to be rushing to Iowa, rushing to New Hampshire. You know that the Democrats are already looking ahead to 2020. Do you want to lock down your ticket right now, sir? Will the Vice President be your running mate in 2020?
The President. Well, I haven't asked him, but I hope so. Where are you? [Laughter] Mike, will you be my running mate? [Laughter] Huh? Stand up, Mike, please. Raise your right hand. No, I'm only kidding. [Laughter] Will you? Thank you, okay good. The answer is ""yes."" Okay?
Q. Thank you, sir.
The President. That was unexpected, but I feel very fine.
Yes, please.
Investigation Into Russia's Interference in 2016 Presidential Election 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Going back to the Russia investigation and the potential investigations from the now-Democratic majority in Congress, some say that you could stop all this by declassifying——
The President. I could. I could fire everybody right now. But I don't want to stop it, because politically, I don't like stopping it.
Q. Yes.
The President. It's a disgrace. It should have never been started because there was no crime. It is—everybody has conflicts. They all have conflicts over there that are beyond anything that anybody has ever seen in terms of conflicts: from the fact that people ask for jobs; from the fact that they have very good friends on the other side, like really good friends, like Comey—who, by the way, lied and leaked and also leaked classified information. Nothing happened there. It might, perhaps. Maybe something is happening that I don't know about.
I stay away from it. But you know what I do? I let it just go on. They're wasting a lot of money, but I let it go on, because I don't want to do that. But you're right: I could end it right now. I could say that investigation is over.
But it's really—it's a disgrace, frankly. And it's an embarrassment to our country. It's an embarrassment to the people of our country. And it's too bad.
Go ahead.
Q. What about the declassification of the documents? Some say that that would clear it all up.
The President. Well, we're looking at that.
Q. Are you still considering it?
The President. No, no. We're looking at that very seriously. Declassification? We're looking at that very seriously. Q. Okay. Can I ask one more question?
The President. It's amazing how people on the other side just don't want those documents declassified. But no, we're looking at that very carefully. I certainly wanted to wait until after the midterms.
Q. Can I ask you one more question, Mr. President? Okay, thank you.
The President. Go ahead.
Abortion 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You have campaigned as a prolife President. You have defended the rights of unborn children. You now have a divided Congress. It's unlikely to pass——
The President. That's right. Tough.
Q. ——to pass any prolife bills.
The President. Very tough issue.
Q. How are you going to push forward your prolife agenda?
The President. Just going to push. I've been pushing. I've done a very good job too. They're very happy with me. But it's a tough issue for the two sides. There's no question about it.
Q. But what are you going to do to——
The President. There is great division—what am I going to do? I won't be able to explain that to you, because it is an issue that is a very divisive, polarizing issue. But there is a solution. I think I have that solution, and nobody else does.
Q. What——
The President. We're going to be working on that.
Yes, go ahead, please. She took your place, but that's okay.
Agriculture Policy 
Q. Mr. President, just a quick question on rural America. In States like Indiana and North Dakota, folks turned out for Republican candidates. Could you talk a little bit about what this means for your agenda in terms of trade and the farm bill?
The President. The farm bill is working really well. I mean, we could have had it approved any time. But we're looking to get work rules approved. The farmers want it. I'd like it. The problem is, the Democrats are not giving us the 10 votes that we need.
We are—everybody wants it. The farmers want it. But the Democrats are not approving the farm bill with work rules. We could have it very fast without the work rules, but we want the work rules in, and the Democrats just don't want to vote for that. So, at some point, they'll have to pay maybe a price.
Jeff [Jeff Mason, Reuters], go ahead.
Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President.
The President. Thank you very much. Efforts To Combat Foreign Interference in 2018 Congressional Elections 
Q. Have you seen any evidence that Russia or China intervened in yesterday's election?
The President. Well, we've going—we're going to make a full report. And unlike the previous administration, we've done a lot of work on that issue. And if you look—speak with the FBI, speak with the Department of Justice, speak to Homeland Security, we've spent a lot of time. It gets very little coverage in the papers. I mean, you cover the nonsense part, but you don't cover the important. This is very important.
And we have been working very hard on China and Russia and everybody else looking into our elections or meddling with our elections. But people tend not to write about it. But we have worked very hard, as you probably heard.
China-U.S. Relations/Russia-U.S. Relations/Russia's Annexation of Crimea 
Q. What do you intend to say, sir, to President Xi and to President Putin when you meet with them later this month?
The President. Well, I have a good relationship with both. I know President Xi better. But I think I have a very good relationship with both. I actually had a very good meeting in Russia that you people didn't agree with, but that's okay. It doesn't much matter, obviously. Because here I am.
Q. You mean Helsinki?
The President. But the fact is that I had a very, very good meeting—a very, very good meeting—with President Putin, and a lot was discussed about security, about Syria, about Ukraine, about the fact that President Obama allowed a very large part of Ukraine to be taken. And right now you have submarines off that particular parcel that we're talking about. You know what I'm talking about.
Q. That was President Putin who annexed Crimea, sir.
The President. That was President Obama's regime. That was during President Obama, right? That was not during me. No, that was President Obama——
Q. But it was President Putin, sir, who did the annexation.
The President. No, no. It was President Obama that allowed it to happen. It had nothing to do with me.
Okay, go ahead. Yes. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead.
2018 Congressional Elections 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Cordelia Lynch, Sky News. You're a man who likes to win, but last night was not an absolute victory for you.
The President. I'll be honest: I thought it was a very-close-to-complete victory. When you look at it from the standpoint of negotiation, when you look at it from the standpoint of deal making—because it's all about deal making—again, if we had the majority, and we had one or two or three votes to play with, we would never—we would have been at a standstill.
I really believe that we have a chance to get along very well with the Democrats. And if that's the case, we can do a tremendous amount of legislation and get it approved by both parties. So I consider it to be—hey, look, I won Georgia. President Obama campaigned very hard in Georgia. Oprah Winfrey campaigned very, very hard. All over the television. I said this is going to be tough. I only had me. I didn't have anybody else. And I went to Georgia, and we had one of the largest crowds that anybody here has seen, ever, at a political rally. And you know what? He won. And he won actually by, you know, a pretty good margin. He won.
And then, we went to Florida, and they had celebrities all over the place. And a man, who happens to be very smart person, was running: Ron DeSantis. And people didn't give him a chance. And I went, and we had—we did some great work. And they're going to have a great Governor of the State of Florida.
And then, we talked about the Senate, and a lot of money was pouring in for the Democrat. This is a man who's been in office for like 44 years or something. This is man who was like a professional at getting elected and being in office. So he's not—Bill Nelson—not easy to beat. Okay? And—but they had a lot of celebrities coming out for Nelson. They had everybody coming out for Nelson. And Rick Scott won. And I helped him.
And I think we've done an amazing job. And you could look at many other places—you just take a look at some of the other places. And we just got the word that, in Iowa, you have a Governor who just got extended, who's—Kim just got extended. And numerous other places.
I think it was a great victory. I'll be honest: I think it was a great victory. And actually, some of the news this morning was that it was, in fact, a great victory.
But if you look at it from the standpoint of gridlock, I really believe there's going to be much less gridlock because of the way this is going, than any other way.
Q. Mr. President, a quick follow-up on that.
The President. Sit down, please.
Go ahead.
Tax Relief 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Let me ask you about one of the campaign promises you made down the stretch, which was a 10-percent tax cut for the middle class.
The President. Yes.
Q. You just talked about gridlock. Democrats, they now run the House Ways and Means Committee. If it means a tax cut of some kind for the middle class, but that means raising rates elsewhere—corporations, on the wealthiest—is that a tradeoff that you would be willing to make in able to enact a middle class tax cut?
The President. Well, it could be. You know that this will have to be now proposed. Because if we did it now, we don't have the votes in the Senate. You don't have—we need—we would need 10 Democrat votes; we probably couldn't get them. If we could, we could pass it very easily in the House. But there's no reason to waste time, because you don't have the votes in the Senate.
But if the—as an example, if the Democrats come up with an idea for tax cuts, which I'm a big believer in tax cuts, I would absolutely pursue something even if it means some adjustment.
Q. Some adjustment on which side? The corporate? The individual? The President. Some adjustment, yes, to make it possible. But I would love to see a tax cut for the middle class. Now, that's going to be their decision. They're going to have to make that decision.
As you know, if we bring it up to the Senate, we'd need Democrat votes—10—and we don't have those 10 votes.
Q. And just because the markets would want to know, sir, some adjustment, would that be 1, 2, 3 percent on either side?
The President. Oh, I'm not telling you that. I'm just saying, I would be certainly willing to do a little bit of an adjustment.
Q. Thank you. Thank you.
The President. Go ahead. Behind. You. Go ahead, please.
World War I Centennial Commemoration in Paris, France/Russia-U.S. Relations 
Q. Mr. President, thank you very much. Two questions. One is, you had talked about leaders who had called to congratulate you. Did President Putin call to congratulate you? And will you, in fact, meet with him at lunch this coming weekend?
The President. Well, as I understand it, we're having—and I guess a lot of you are going over. We're having a lunch for numerous countries. I'll be there. I believe President Putin is going to be there. We don't have anything scheduled. I don't think we have anything scheduled in Paris. And I'm coming back very quickly.
We're going over—there's a great event. This is an important—really, it's going to be very important and, I think, a very beautiful ceremony. I'm looking forward to going. And we're representing the incredible heroes of the world, but the heroes of our country from World War I. And so I'll be going there, and I am very proud to go there.
Q. And did he call you?
The President. I don't think we have time set aside for that meeting.
Now, with that being said, we're very shortly meeting again at the G-20, where he'll be there, and I'll be there. And that's where we're actually looking forward to meeting.
Q. And——
The President. We will be having a lunch, but I think there are many people there.
Potential White House Personnel Changes/The President's Cabinet/White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly 
Q. And did he call you to congratulate you? And if I could also just invite you, since this is quite a gathering we've got here, to go ahead and talk about the staff changes that you expect in the White House, while we're here. We're eager to hear about them. Is General Kelly going to stay on?
The President. Well, I think what I'll do is—as we make changes, we'll sit down and talk to you about it. No, I mean, there's no great secret. A lot of administrations make changes after midterms. I will say that, for the most part, I'm very, very happy with this Cabinet. We're doing a great job. Q. But what about in the White House? What about in the White House, sir? You've got a lot White House staff. Some have been talking about leaving. General Kelly has been rumored to be leaving. Is he?
The President. Well, that's okay. But no, people leave. People leave.
Q. And is that going to happen, sir?
The President. People leave. I haven't heard about John Kelly.
[Many reporters began asking questions. The President continued as follows.]
But no, people—people leave. They come in, they're here. It's a very exhausting job. Although, I love doing it, I must tell you. But it's exhausting for a lot of people. I'm surprised that a lot of people. They start off, they're young people, they're there for 2 years, and they're old by the time they leave. [Laughter] It's quite exhausting. But I love doing it.
And I'll tell you, there will be changes. Nothing monumental from that standpoint. I don't think very much different than most administrations. But—and we have—I mean, we have many people lined up for every single position. Any position. Everybody wants to work in this White House. We are a hot country. This is a hot White House. [Laughter] We are a White House that people want to work with.
Okay. Go ahead. No, no. Please. Behind you. Behind you. Go ahead.
2018 Congressional Elections/Political Polarization/News Media/National Economy 
Q. Mr. President, this has been a very challenging campaign. It is—this has been a very challenging campaign.
The President. It's been a very challenging campaign. That's true.
Q. It has involved quite of a lot of abuse and a lot of violence. People have died during the course of this campaign.
The President. Right.
Q. Is there any way in which you think the temperature could be lowered? Perhaps peace could break out with the media? Perhaps your bipartisan relationships across the House and the Senate may now produce some change. Or are we going to have more of the same?
The President. It's a very fair question. Look, I would love to see unity and peace and love and any other word you want to use. And obviously, I think we had to, especially at this particular juncture, we had to wait until after the midterms are over. Now they're over.
If they would cover me fairly—which they don't. Which they don't. I'm not saying that in a hostile way. I get extremely inaccurate coverage. I can do something that's fantastic, and they'll make it look like not good. And I don't mind being—having bad stories. I make a mistake, cover it. I would like you to cover it fairly, but cover it.
But when you do something terrific—look how little the economy is talked about. A poll came out this morning talking about how little the three networks—I don't think they included CNN—but how little the three networks talk about how good the economy is. How little. Almost not at all.
If President Obama had this economy—and by the way, if that administration, through somebody else, kept going, you would have had negative-4.2- instead of positive-4.2-percent growth. You would have had negative. It was heading down. But here—the point is this——
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. Excuse me. I would love to see unity, including with the media. Because I think the media—I'll be honest: I think it's a very divisive thing for our country. And you would be amazed at how smart people are that are reading your stories and seeing your stories and watching. You would be amazed how perceptive and how smart they are. They get it. And it really does bring disunity.
Q. [Inaudible]—going to ask you a——
The President. Excuse me. You are not called on.
Q. I'm trying to ask you a question.
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead, please.
Q. About Turkey?
The President's Religious Faith 
Q. Thank you, President Trump. Shortly after your victory speech on the historic night of—back in November 2016, I asked you to what single factor you most attributed this victory to and——
The President. Say it? You have to speak up.
Q. Sure. On the night of your victory, I asked you, right after your speech, to what you would attribute your victory. You pointed up to the ceiling, and you said that it was God. Based off of that, how would you say, over the last 2 years, God plays—what kind of a factor He plays in the day-to-day execution of the Office of the Presidency?
The President. Well, God plays a big factor in my life, and God plays a factor in the lives of many people that I know very well in this room, like your Vice President.
Q. And——
The President. God plays a very big role in my life.
2018 Congressional Elections 
Q. And one more back to—a quick one. Quick follow-up: Which loss last night surprised you the most? And which of these unsuccessful candidates are you most likely to consider for a future administration?
The President. Nothing surprises me in politics.
Q. Would you consider any——
The President. But there were some losses last night. And there were some victories last night that have been incredible. I ","mean, there were victories last night that nobody would believe, especially based on the suppression polls. They had a lot of suppression polls.
Q. Would you consider any——
The President. And there were some victories last night that were very surprising, but I'm not going to pick out special—you know, special people. Q. But would you consider any for a post?
The President. It's tough enough for those people to have a loss.
Q. Would you consider any for an administration post, moving forward? As one of the very few of the 3.7 percent unemployed——
The President. Would I what? What?
Q. Would you consider any of the people who lost last night for a post in the administration in the near future?
The President. I know a couple of very good ones. Yes, I would, actually.
Go ahead, please.
The President's Rhetoric/News Media 
Q. Mr. President—Mr. President, I asked you on Monday if there was anything that you regret in your first 2 years. And you said that, at times, you could have and should have used a, quote, ""softer tone."" Your critics, as you can imagine—your skeptics—they say they're not holding their breath on that happening. Will you indeed have to change your tone if you're to get things passed through Congress after losing the House?
And you also said you might extend an olive branch. And what would that look like?
The President. I would love to have—I'd be very good at a low tone. But when things are done not correctly about you—written about you, said about you on television, on wherever it is—you have to defend yourself.
I would love to do very—a very even tone. It's much easier than what I have to do. I have to go around. And going around is much easier than facing somebody and being treated fairly. But when you're not treated fairly, you really have no choice.
I would love to have a very even, modest, boring tone. I would be very honored by that. But you know what? When you have to fight—all the time fight—because you're being misrepresented by the media, you really can't do that.
Q. But not about the media, sir. But, sir, real quickly—not about the media, but what about with Congress?
The President. Yes, please. Go ahead.
Q. On Afghanistan?
Japan-U.S. Trade 
Q. Mr. President, can you tell us how you focus on the economic——
The President. Where are you from, please?
Q. Japan. Prime Minister Abe.
The President. Okay. Say hello. Say hello to Shinzo. [Laughter]
Q. Yes.
The President. I'm sure he's happy about tariffs on his cars. [Laughter] Go ahead.
Q. That's my question, actually. So how you focus on the trade and economic issues with Japan? Will you ask Japan to do more? Will you change your tone? The President. I don't—I really don't understand you.
Q. How would you focus on trade and economic issues——
The President. Trade with Japan?
Q. Yes.
The President. Well, we're dealing with Japan right now on trade. Japan has—it's a great country. You have a great Prime Minister who just had a very successful election.
Q. Yes.
The President. He's a very good friend of mine. He's one of the people I'm closest with. And—but I tell him all the time that Japan does not treat the United States fairly on trade. They send in millions of cars at a very low tax. They don't take our cars. And if they do, they have a massive tax on the cars.
Japan—and I'm not blaming Japan; I'm blaming the people that were in charge of the United States for allowing that to happen. But as you know, we have close to $100 billion trade deficit with Japan. And Japan has treated us very unfairly. But don't feel lonely, because you weren't the only one.
Q. How about North Korea? How about North Korea?
North Korea 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Two international questions. The first one: Secretary Pompeo's talks about North—with North Korea have been postponed. What is happening there?
The President. Yes, nothing there——
Q. And will your meeting still happen with——
The President. No, we're going to change it, because of trips that are being made. We're going to make it at another date. But we're very happy how it's going with North Korea. We think it's going fine. We're in no rush. We're in no hurry. The sanctions are on.
Q. You still expect to meet Kim Jong Un?
The President. No, no. Listen. Excuse me. Wait.
Q. Sorry, sir.
The President. The sanctions are on. The missiles have stopped. The rockets have stopped. The hostages are home. The great heroes have been coming home.
Mike Pence was in Hawaii, where the—one of the most beautiful ceremonies that anyone has ever seen for the fallen. These are great heroes. Very important. When I was running, a lot of people—as many years ago as it was—in many cases, grandchildren—but they were asking about that. They're coming home, and they're being provided to us as we speak.
But I'm in no rush. I'm in no rush. The sanctions are on. I read a couple of times, and I've seen a few times where they said, ""He's done so much."" What have I done? I met.
Now, I'd love to take the sanctions off. But they have to be responsive too. It's a two-way street. But we're not in any rush at all. There's no rush whatsoever. You know, before I got here, they were dealing with this for over 70 years. And I guess, on a nuclear front, for 25 years. That's a long time.
I've been there; I probably left Singapore 4 or 5 months ago. And we made more progress in that 4 or 5 months than they've made in 70 years. And nobody else could have done what I've done.
But I'll say this. I'll say this very simply: We're in no rush. The sanctions are on. And whenever it is—but that meeting is going to be rescheduled.
Q. That meeting—but about your meeting with Kim Jong Un, sir, will it happen in the next months?
The President. Sometime next year, I would say.
Q. Sometime next year?
The President. Sometime early next year. Yes.
Canada-U.S. Relations 
Q. And a quick question on the USMCA. Now that it's been concluded, have you repaired your relationship with Prime Minister Trudeau?
The President. Yes, I have. We have a very good relationship.
Rise in Anti-Semitism and Hate Crimes/The President's Support for Israel 
Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. We've been talking a lot about division and the division that exists in this country right now.
The President. True. That's true.
Q. And some of the statistics are disturbing, I think, to just about everyone. Anti-Semitic incidents have increased by 57 percent since 2016. Hate crimes are on the rise. Why do you think that is? And what will you do about it as President?
The President. It's very sad to see it. I hate to see it. And, as you know, I've done more—in fact, if you were with us the last time we met, Prime Minister Netanyahu said that, ""This President has done more for Israel than any other President."" Those words. Those exact words.
Jerusalem, protection, working together—so many different things. But the big thing is Jerusalem. You know, many, many Presidents have said they are going to build the Embassy in Jerusalem. Never happened. Making it the capital of Israel—never happened. Never happened. But it happened with me and quickly.
And not only did it happen, we built the Embassy. That would have taken another 15 or 20 years and cost probably billions of dollars, and we did it for a tiny amount of money. It's already done. It's open.
Nobody has done more for Israel than Donald Trump. And the nice part is that's not me saying it; that's Prime Minister Netanyahu.
Political Polarization/National Economy/China 
Q. But what about the—Mr. President, what about the divides in this country? Mr. President, what about healing the divides in this country and addressing those issues, specifically? The President. Well, we want to see it healed. And one of the things I think that can help heal is the success of our country. We are really successful now. We've gone up $11.7 trillion in worth.
If you know, China has come down tremendously. Tremendously. China would have superseded us in 2 years as an economic power; now, they're not even close. China got rid of their ""China '25"" because I found it very insulting. I said that to them. I said, ""China '25"" is very insulting, because ""China '25"" means, in 2025, they're going to take over, economically, the world. I said, ""That's not happening.""
And we've gone way up. They've gone down. And I don't want them to go down. We'll have a good meeting, and we're going to see what we can do. But I have to say this: Billions of dollars will soon be pouring into our Treasury from taxes that China is paying for us. And if you speak to Mr. Pillsbury, who probably is the leading authority on China, he was on the other day saying he has never seen anything like it. And you know who else hasn't? China hasn't.
Q. And, Mr. President——
The President. But we're going to try and make a deal with China because I want to have great relationships with President Xi, as I do, and also with China.
Q. You're talking about the economic——
The President. Okay.
The President's Role as a Moral Leader 
Q. How do you see your role——
The President. All right.
Q. ——as a moral leader?
The President. Go ahead, please.
Q. Mr. President, just how do you see——
The President. Go ahead, please. Please, please.
Q. ——your role as a moral leader?
The President. Please, please. Go ahead. There's so many people, I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Q. As a moral leader though?
The President. I think I am a great moral leader, and I love our country.
Go ahead, please.
Bipartisanship/The President's Relationship With Congressional Democrats/House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi 
Q. Thank you, sir. You said earlier in this press conference that Democrats had a choice; that you would not work with them on legislation if they were investigating you. Do you not have a choice in the matter as well? Don't you have a responsibility——
The President. No, I think it's inappropriate—no, no. I think it's very inappropriate. We should get along and get deals done. Now, we can investigate. They look at us. We look at them. It goes on for 2 years. Then, at the end of 2 years, nothing is done. Now, what's bad for them is, being in the majority, I'm just going to blame them. You understand. I'm going to blame them. They're the majority.
Honestly, it makes it much simpler for me. I—they will be blamed. But I think Nancy Pelosi—and you know, I put that statement out on social media today about Nancy Pelosi that, if she's short of votes—because frankly, I think she deserves—and a lot of people thought I was being sarcastic or I was kidding. I wasn't.
I think she deserves it. She's been fighting long for it. She's been fighting—I really mean this. This—there was nothing sarcastic about it or—it was really meant in—with very good intentions. I think she deserves it. She's fought long and hard. She's a very capable person. And you know, you have other people shooting at her, trying to take over the Speakership.
And I said, if—if it's appropriate—I said, if we can and if we will, if she has a problem, I think I would be able to very easily supply her the necessary votes.
That's not said in any way other than I really believe she deserves that position. I also believe that Nancy Pelosi and I can work together and get a lot of things done, along with Mitch and everybody else that we have to work with. I think we'll get a lot done.
Q. Mr. President, why can't you——
The President. Okay, go ahead.
Q. Mr. President, why can't you——
The President. Go ahead.
Q. Mr. President, why can't you do that while subpoenas are coming through?
The President. Excuse me?
Bipartisanship/2018 Congressional Elections 
Q. Why can't you work together while there are subpoenas or while there are investigations in process?
The President. I think we will. Look, now that the election is over—the election is over. Now everybody is in love. But then, I see the hostility of questions in the room. I come in here as a nice person wanting to answer questions, and I have people jumping out of their seats, screaming questions at me.
No, the election is over. And I'm, you know, very—I am extraordinarily happy. I really am. And by the way, I'd tell you if I wasn't.
Look at what happened in Florida. Look at what happened in Georgia. Look at what happened in so many locations with Governorships. Nobody talks about the Governorships. Look at the amount of work that was given to these other candidates against my candidate.
And, I mean, I'm extraordinarily happy. And if I wasn't, I'd let you know. There's nothing wrong. I mean, look, you look at midterms and you look at elections—elections generally—you see it's very rare that a party who has the Presidency does well. We did unbelievably well. To win Florida, both the Senate and the Governorship against two very talented people.
I'll tell you what: We did incredibly. To win Georgia, where you had some of the biggest stars in the world campaigning endlessly, including President Obama. You know, I'm—I'll tell you what: This was a great victory for us. And again, from a deal-making standpoint, we are all much better off the way it turned out. Because I really believe, if the Democrats want to, we can do a tremendous amount of great legislation.
Yes, please. Go ahead.
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Should we keep this going for a little while?
Q. Yes!
Q. Yes, I think you should keep this going.
The President. You know what, when you get bored, would you please tell me? Seriously, tell me. I don't want to——
Q. You're never boring.
The President. Oh, no. Hopefully, not. I don't want to overstay. But yes, please. Go ahead.
The President's Rhetoric/White Nationalism/The President's Support Among African Americans 
Q. Hi, Mr. President. Yamiche Alcindor with PBS NewsHour. On the campaign trail, you called yourself a nationalist. Some people saw that as emboldening White nationalists. Now people are also saying——
The President. I don't know why you'd say that. That's such a racist question.
Q. There are some people that say that now the Republican Party is seen as supporting White nationalists because of your rhetoric. What do you make of that?
The President. Oh, I don't believe that. I don't believe that.
I don't believe—well, I don't know. Why do I have my highest poll numbers ever with African Americans? Why do I have among the highest poll numbers with African Americans? I mean, why do I have my highest poll numbers? That's such a racist question.
Honestly, I mean, I know you have it written down, and you're going to tell me. Let me tell you: That's a racist question.
Q. And Mr. President, I'm going to ask you——
The President. I love—and you know what the word is? I love our country. I do. You call—you have nationalists. You have globalists. I also love the world, and I don't mind helping the world, but we have to straighten out our country first. We have a lot of problems.
Q. And——
The President. Excuse me. But to say that—what you said is so insulting to me. It's a very terrible thing that you said.
Q. And Mr. President—Mr. President, people have——
The President. Okay. Please, go ahead. Go ahead.
Tax Relief 
Q. You've talked about——
The President. Excuse me. Q. You talked about middle class tax cuts on the campaign trail. How will you get Democrats to support that policy?
The President. You have to ask them.
Q. Well, what's your plan for working with Democrats——
The President. Excuse me.
Q. ——on the middle class tax plan?
The President. You know what my plan is? You know what my plan is? I'll ask them. And if they say yes, I'm all for it. And if they say no, there's nothing you can do, because you need their votes.
Go ahead.
2018 Congressional Elections 
Q. Yes. Thank you, Mr. President. Francesca Chambers, DailyMail.com. You said many times on the campaign trail that you didn't want Nancy Pelosi to be Speaker. At least you suggested that. You spent a lot of time talking about her and Chuck Schumer.
The President. It's not a question of want. I would've—so let me answer it a little—would I have preferred winning by two or three or four? I would almost have to think about that. But certainly, I like to win. And if I win, she's not going to be Speaker.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi/Impeachment/Political Polarization 
Q. What did she say to you though, yesterday——
The President. We had a great conversation.
Q. ——that made you give her her support—your support?
The President. Honestly, we had a very warm conversation. You know, she loves this country. And she's a very smart woman. She's done a very good job. She was really—I mean, she's had a very——
Q. Did she promise that they wouldn't seek to impeach you?
The President. She's had a very, very—we didn't talk about impeaching. We didn't talk about—what do you do? Do you impeach somebody because he created the greatest economic success in the history of our country? ""Let's impeach him, because the country is so successful. Let's impeach him."" ""Has he done anything wrong?"" They asked somebody, ""Has he done anything wrong?"" ""No, but let's impeach him anyway.""
And they also said: ""Let's impeach Justice Kavanaugh. Let's impeach him."" And now they have the second woman coming out that—the first or second. And I hate to say this, but it was public. ""And after him, we're going to impeach the Vice President. We're going to impeach Mike Pence."" Mike Pence doesn't get impeached for anything. [Laughter] ""So let's impeach the President, and then we'll impeach the Vice President.""
These people are sick. And you know what? They have to get their bearing. Really, they have to get their bearing. And when you ask about division, they're the ones that cause the division. They cause tremendous division.
Retirements Among Republican Members of Congress/Senator Jeffrey L. Flake Q. Okay. Regarding all the retirements in the House, Mr. President, very quickly, you suggested that——
The President. Who is retiring?
Q. You said that many of the retirements that happened in the House made it very difficult for——
The President. Many retirements, yes.
Q. ——that made it very difficult for you in this election cycle, and that it was because they were chairmans, there were chairmanships that were vacated. But Jeff Flake wasn't a chairman of a committee, and Paul Ryan also retired this cycle. So why do you think that is? Whose fault is it that there were so many retirements?
The President. In Jeff Flake's case, it's me. Pure and simple. I retired him. [Laughter] I'm very proud of it. I did the country a great service.
Go ahead. Give him that—[laughter]. Give him that—he is retired. I'd like to call it another word, but we're going to treat him with great respect.
Go ahead.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Jeff Flake. That's another beauty. [Laughter]
Go ahead.
Q. Two questions, please.
The President. No, one. One. One. One. Too many people. Sorry.
The President's Interaction With the News Media/White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders 
Q. Well, all right. All right. You seem to enjoy this venue very much. Are you going to make the standard press conference a staple of the remaining 2 years?
The President. No. No.
Q. Or will you have more briefings with Sarah Sanders?
The President. No. You know, when I don't do the—I think Sarah is fantastic. Where is Sarah? Where is Sarah? Sarah is so great. I think, Sarah, you've represented me so well and been abused. She's been horribly treated by a lot of people.
Q. So she's going to stay on as Press Secretary?
The President. No, no. It's very interesting because Sarah was telling—we were talking about it the other day.
So I had a period where I figured, you know what I'll do? I won't do any real interviews. And then, they start saying, ""Why doesn't he do—why?"" And they're all coming up with all kinds—Then, over the last couple of months, I decided, I'll do a lot—we'll stop at the helicopter, we'll do this, we'll do a lot of—and then they say: ""Why is he doing so many press conferences? What's wrong? What?"" So when I don't do them, you say, ""What's wrong?"" When I do do them, you say, ""What's wrong?"" And when I go in the middle, you say, ""What's wrong?"" But in the media—you know that, John. Right?
The President's Interaction With the News Media 
Q. [Inaudible]—never complained about access.
The President. You're sort of right.
Q. [Inaudible]—never complained about access.
The President. Okay, good.
Q. None of us will ever complain——
The President. No, no. You did. Excuse me. Well, you complained about access when I purposely just stayed away from the press for a while, because I wanted to see how it worked. And can I be honest with you? It didn't work well. It didn't work well.
Q. Mr. President, I didn't finish the question. So Sarah will stay on as Press Secretary?
The President. Okay, please. Go ahead. No. Go ahead.
Q. Mr. President, what might make—could I get the microphone?
The President's Interaction With the News Media 
Q. First off, I personally think it's very good to have you here because a free press and this type of engagement——
The President. I do, too. Actually? I do, too.
Q. Yes. It's vital to democracy.
The President. It's called ""earned media."" It's worth billions. Go ahead. [Laughter]
The President's Tax Returns 
Q. So I have two questions for you, if that's all right? It's a rare opportunity. First, just a point of clarification on the tax returns issue. You brought up the audit. That doesn't prevent you from releasing them.
The President. I know it. Sure. But I didn't say it prevented me, I said lawyers will tell you not to do it. Go ahead. What's your next question? Go ahead.
Q. But if, well, just on that——
The President. Come on. Let's go. More exciting question than that, please.
Racism Allegations Against the President 
Q. Okay. The second one: Michael Cohen recently said you called Black voters ""stupid.""
The President. That's false.
Q. Omarosa has accused you of using the N-word.
The President. That's false.
Q. And the rapper Little Jon has said you called him ""Uncle Tom."" What's your response?
The President. I don't know who Little Jon is. I don't—I really don't. Q. He was on ""The Apprentice.""
The President. I don't know. Oh, he was? Okay. Oh, I see. I don't know.
Q. Have you ever made racist remarks?
The President. No. No, I would never do that, and I don't use racist remarks. And you know what? If I did, you people have—you would've known about it. I've been hearing there are tapes. For years and years, ""There are tapes.""
Number one, I never worried about it, because I never did. I never used racist remarks. I have never used racist remarks.
Okay.
Political Polarization/Racism Allegations Against the President 
Q. Well, one point of fact——
The President. Go ahead.
Q. You have—no, no, one point of fact, because you told her you have the highest approval——
The President. Quiet. Quiet.
Q. ——among African Americans.
The President. Quiet. Quiet.
Go ahead.
Q. It's just 8 percent, sir. Single digits.
The President. See, when you talk about division, it's people like this that cause division. Great division.
Q. Point of fact, sir.
The President. Great—no. No, point of fact is that I never used a racist remark. That's the point of fact.
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. Where—who are you from?
Q. I'm from Yahoo! News. [Inaudible]
The President. Yahoo!—oh, Yahoo!—oh, good. Good, I hope they're doing well.
Q. MTV Lebanon—[inaudible]. Sir, first question——
The President. Where are you from?
Q. MTV Lebanon. Lebanon.
The President. Lebanon. Good.
International Oil Market 
Q. Yes. Thank you, Mr. President. We're so happy to be—as well have this opportunity. Mr.—President Erdogan said he's not going to follow your sanctions and he's going to keep buying oil from—— The President. Who said that?
Q. President Erdogan. Turkey.
The President. I know. I know.
Q. And you're going to meet him soon——
The President. I just can't understand his speak——
Q. Okay. You're going to meet him soon. You're going to have this talk, and some countries are going to take the same steps that President Erdogan is doing and——
The President. So let me just say about the oil, okay? So we're—we imposed, just recently, the strongest sanctions in the history of our country, just about. Although, I guess North Korea is there too. But I gave some countries a break on the oil. I did it a little bit because they really asked for some help. But I really did it because I don't want to drive oil prices up to $100 a barrel or $150 a barrel, because I'm driving them down.
If you look at oil prices, they've come down very substantially over the last couple of months. That's because of me. Because you have a monopoly called OPEC. And I don't like——
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. Wait! And I don't like that monopoly. I don't like it. And oil prices are coming down.
So rather than deciding to be as tough as I am on most of the sanctions, what I've done is, I said, we're not going to do it that way; we're going to let some of the oil go out to these countries that really do need it, because I don't want to drive the oil prices up to $100 or $150 a barrel, which could happen very easily. It's a very fragile market. Very, very fragile. I know it very well. And it's the absolute right decision.
And they'll get tougher as time goes by—maybe—but I don't want to have any effect on the oil prices worldwide, where I drive them up. Because I consider that to be a tax, and I don't like taxes.
Go ahead.
Q. What happened with the peace process between Israel and Palestine?
The President. Go ahead. Please. Please.
Q. The peace process is over?
The President. Who?
Senator Jonathan Tester 
Q. They just announced that Jon Tester won——
The President. Oh, congratulations to Jon Tester. Congratulations. I'm sure you're very unhappy about that.
Go ahead.
Q. Mr. President, can——
Press Secretary Sanders. [Inaudible] The President. Yes. Please, go ahead.
Q. Can you address the——
The President. We'll take a couple of more, and then we'll go.
Georgia Gubernatorial Election 
Q. Can you address concerns in places like Georgia where people waited in line to vote for hours, where voting machines weren't working in certain districts, and there hasn't——
The President. Do you think that's the reason that the candidate lost?
Q. Well, there are concerns being raised that it wasn't——
The President. Well, I mean, look, I wasn't involved in Georgia. I wasn't.
Q. I know, but are—but, as President——
The President. Other than I love the State. I do love the State.
Q. Yes, but as President of the United States, are you concerned about the access that people are having to voting?
The President. I heard it was very efficient in Georgia. I heard it was very efficient. But again, you'd have to ask the State governments, because—just one of those things you're going to have to ask them.
Yes, go ahead. Please. Please, go ahead.
Regulation of Social Media Companies 
Q. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. You expressed some concerns about social media companies unfairly censoring conservatives during the election. Do you anticipate working with Democrats to regulate these companies, or are you satisfied with the way things are?
The President. I would do that, yes. I would look at that very seriously. I think it's a serious problem. At the same time, you start getting into speech; that's a very dangerous problem. That could be the beginning. So it's very dangerous.
Believe it or not, I'm one that really likes free speech. A lot of people don't understand that. But I am a big believer. And when you start regulating, a lot of bad things can happen.
But I would certainly talk to the Democrats if they want to do that. And I think they do want to do that.
Yes, sir. Go ahead.
Executive Power/Former President Barack Obama/Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program 
Q. Former President Barack Obama famously said that he had ""a pen and a phone"" to use executive power on issues like immigration. Do you see yourself using executive power to get some of your immigration agenda done?
The President. I do. I do. I think that some of it I can use executive power—on some. Not all. But I got—I mean, he certainly used it. He used it on DACA. And when he did it, he said something to the effect that ""I'm not allowed to do this, it will never hold up, but I'm doing it anyway."" And he did it, and they found judges that approved it. We also found judges that didn't approve it, so it's obviously going to be determined in the Supreme Court.
And if the Supreme—if the Court rules in favor of what President Obama thinks they should rule—which is what he said—then I will probably have a deal with the Democrats in a very short period of time. We were very close to having a deal until we got that very strange ruling.
Birthright Citizenship 
Q. Thank you, sir. You also made some promises about immigration during the campaign, and I want to know if you're going to follow through with them. Are you going to be aggressive——
The President. Which one are you talking about?
Q. Birthright citizenship. Are you going to sign the Executive order to ban——
The President. We are looking at it very seriously. Absolutely.
Q. I mean, is it yes or no? Or are you——
The President. And I believe we have the absolute right. But that's another case that will be determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.
Deployment of U.S. Armed Forces Personnel to Mexico-U.S. Border 
Q. Are you going to send 15,000 troops to the border?
The President. You've been reading the same documents as I have; you know exactly what I'm doing. You know exactly what I'm doing.
So go ahead. What's your next question?
Death of Saudi Journalist Jamal Khashoggi 
Q. Also, on the Khashoggi matter, it's been more than a month since the death of Mr. Khashoggi, the journalist.
The President. Yes. Very sad thing. Very terrible thing.
Q. Do you think Saudi Arabia is guilty of having him murdered? And if so, what kind of punishment would be involved?
The President. I'll have a much stronger opinion on that subject over the next week, and I'm"," working very closely with Congress. We're working together. Some very talented people. And we're working with Congress, we're working with Turkey, and we're working with Saudi Arabia. And I'm forming a very strong opinion.
Go ahead, Jon. Go ahead, Jon.
2018 Congressional Elections/Democratic Party 
Q. Mr. President, this is just a quick follow-up. You said something about Nancy Pelosi. You said that Nancy Pelosi, she loves our country. Do you regret some of the things you said during the campaign?
The President. No.
Q. I mean, at various times, you said Democrats—— The President. No.
Q. ——want to put a ""wrecking ball . . . to our future""; they want to ""destroy our country.""
The President. Well, I believe that. I believe that. With their current policy, they are using a wrecking ball on our country. I believe that a hundred percent. This would be a wrecking ball. But I think there's a compromise somewhere, and I think that could be really good for our country.
Okay, how about one more?
2018 Congressional Elections 
Q. Do you regret the ad? Do you regret the ad that you did that was branded as a racist ad and even Fox News wouldn't air it?
The President. No, I don't. No. No. No.
Q. NBC wouldn't air it, and other networks.
The President. Do I regret it?
Q. Yes.
The President. I'm surprised you'd ask me that question. I do not.
Go ahead, please.
Efforts To Combat Domestic Terrorism and Extremism 
Q. Thank you, sir. And I think we'd all love to have more of these if you're willing.
In 2017, shortly after you took office, your Homeland Security Department shuttered a program to counter homegrown, right-wing extremism, White supremacism, and related terrorist groups—domestic terrorist groups—and redirected that funding towards fighting Islamic terrorism. Do you believe that White supremacist terrorists, right-wing terrorists, these homegrown terrorists on that side of the spectrum are a problem, sir?
The President. Yes, I do. I do believe that's a problem.
Q. And what is your administration going to do about it?
The President. I believe all hate is a problem, but I do believe that is a problem.
Q. What are you going to do about it, sir?
The President. And it's a problem we want to solve.
Q. How, sir? What are you going to do about it, sir?
The President. Okay, go ahead.
Q. Sir, what are you going to do about it? You cut off the funding.
Q. Mr. President, you've said——
The President. No, we have given funding for that—a lot of funding. But I do believe it's a problem. And can I tell you what? It's a problem that I don't like even a little bit.
Go ahead.
2018 Congressional Elections Q. Aixa Diaz with Hearst Television. You've said, ""Pretend I'm on the ballot""—yesterday. You called it a referendum on your Presidency. Many local districts across the country rejected your midterm message, particularly suburban women. How do you bridge that divide now, also with the influx of women coming into Congress?
The President. I think my message was very well received. I mean, just look at the results. Midterm elections are disasters for sitting Presidents and administrations. This has been a very successful—and look, you can write it any way you want. And if you disagree with me—this has been incredibly successful—when you look at the races. How about Ohio? I didn't even mention. I mentioned Florida; I mentioned Georgia. How about the Governor of Ohio? A fantastic——
Q. But what's your message to suburban women voters?
The President. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. A fantastic man, who was down on the polls. And everybody was talking about this person that was so great. And I went up there, and I did a rally, and they have now a great Governor—you're going to have a great Governor in Ohio for, hopefully, a long period of time. But for 4 years. And Mike DeWine is a fantastic person.
And I went up there for two reasons: Because I felt that his opposition was not a good person—and we know a lot about him—and I felt that Mike was a fantastic person. And he won. And not only did he win, he won easily.
So add that to Florida and add that to Georgia and add that to all of the other races that we won—outside, even, of the Senate races, which were the biggest of all. Because these were races that—and Mike Pence can tell you, and some of the folks over here can tell you—these were races that were going to be unopposed. We were going to—were not going to oppose certain of the people running, certain Senators. They said they couldn't be beaten. They said Heidi could not be beaten. ""Please, don't do it."" They couldn't—this was a year out.
Q. What about in the suburban districts? How do you get those back?
The President. Excuse me. You—no, but you're telling me about—you're telling me about popularity. They said many of these people—when I said 9 out of 11—but I said—when many of these people—these weren't, like, easy races; these were tough races.
And so I think the level of popularity—the first question I was asked was about: ""Well, what have you learned? What about your own popularity?"" I think that's what I learned, is my—I was very well received by this great country, by the people of our great country. And I'm very proud of that, because I love the people of this country. These people—we are the greatest people. I love the people of our country.
2018 Congressional Elections/The President's Accomplishments
Q. So what do you say to women, Mr. President?
The President. And I'll tell you something: When you look at the races that we won in Florida, which we weren't expected to win; and Georgia, which we weren't expected to win; and Ohio, which we weren't expected to win—and won; I mean, you look at some of them—the number of votes that we got is incredible.
So I'm really happy with not only the way it came out, but the response to me as your President. And as your President, I've made our country safe. I've rebuilt and am in the process of rebuilding our military. And the jobs are here. Every one of them built here. We're going to have the strongest—very shortly, we're going to have the strongest military our country has ever had.
I've done more for the vets than any President has done, certainly in many, many decades, with choice and with other things, as you know. With other things.
But our vets are doing better than they've ever done. But if you look at choice—choice alone—I mean, just take a look at what we've done with choice. But the people of our country are very happy with the job that I'm doing. And you know, one of the things—
Border Security/2018 Congressional Elections 
Q. But looking ahead to 2020——
The President. One of the things that they want so much is security. They want security, both at the border—they want it with our military; they want it with law enforcement; they want it with ICE.
You know, we've taken out thousands of MS-13 gang members—thousands out of our—hard to believe—thousands—out of our country. Women of our country, who are incredible people, they want security; they want safety. They want financial security also. We've done that. But they want physical security.
And we've taken out thousands of people that shouldn't be in this country. But we have to get strong immigration laws so they don't come in. We want laws where they don't come in, where we don't have to take them out, per se.
And again, I'm very honored to be with all of you. It was a great day yesterday. It was a great evening. I think we had a tremendous success. And hopefully, the tone can get better. Hopefully——
News Media 
Q. How will you change that?
The President. Hopefully, the tone can get a lot better. And I really believe it begins with the media. I really believe—we used to call it the ""press."" But I really——
Q. Does it begin with you, Mr. President?
The President. But I really believe it begins with the media. If you would cover—and there was a very interesting story written in a very good paper recently that talked about the fact that it isn't good what the media is doing and that I do have the right to fight back, because I'm treated very unfairly.
So I do fight back. And I'm fighting back not for me; I'm fighting back for the people of this country.
Thank you all very much. Thank you."
"May 27, 2019","The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan in Tokyo, Japan",Donald J. Trump,"Donald J. Trump, The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan in Tokyo, Japan Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/333586",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-shinzo-abe-japan-tokyo-japan-1,"Moderator. We would like to commence the joint press conference with Prime Minister Abe and President Donald Trump. In the beginning, Prime Minister Abe will speak, which will be followed by the remarks by President Trump.
Prime Minister, floor is yours.
Prime Minister Abe. On the 1st of May, His Imperial Majesty the Emperor acceded to the throne, and we now have the new era called Reiwa. At the dawn of the new era, it is of utmost pleasure that I am able to welcome President Trump and Madam Melania as our first state guests in the era of Heisei. They are my dearest friends, for myself and for myself—for my wife.
With President Trump, we had the summit talk last month at White House, and we celebrated Melania's birthday together, didn't we? Next month, he will be visiting Japan again in order to come to the G-20 Osaka summit. Because of the peace and security legislation, U.S. and Japan have become an alliance where we can help one another. The bond has become rock solid.
Because of the very close personal relationship with Donald, the bond of U.S.-Japan alliance has become unshakeable, the closest in the whole world. In the new era of Reiwa, U.S. and Japan must lead for the peace and prosperity of the region and international community as the genuinely global partners.
This visit of President and Madam Trump to Japan is a golden opportunity to clearly show the unshakeable bond to the whole world and inside Japan as well. I'd like to express my gratitude to the friendship of President Trump and Madam First Lady.
At the summit talk today, bearing in mind of the latest North Korean situation, we spent a good amount of time in better aligning our policies. The positions of Japan and the United States in this regard are completely on the same page. President Trump and Madam Melania continue to meet the family members of the abduction victims. Just like 2 years ago, when they visited Japan, they encouraged and gave comfort to the members of the victims.
Toward the resolution of the most important abduction issue, at the earliest possible timing, is what I am hoping for, and I'm determined that I have to face Chairman Kim Jong Un, myself, directly. Without any conditions, I will meet with the Chairman, and I would like to have a discussion frankly, in complete candor.
President Trump has expressed strong support to my determination as such by saying that he would support me totally and would not spare any efforts in assisting me. Continuously, we will have the close collaboration between the two countries. We shall missing no opportunities and look toward the early resolution of the abduction issue. We will act resolutely.
In today's summit meeting, we welcomed the steady progress of U.S.-Japan cooperation, looking toward the creation of free and open Indo-Pacific, including the areas such as energy, digital, and infrastructure. Going forward, we will walk hand in hand and promote the cooperation for the realization of this common vision of our two nations. We will be promoting the idea forcefully. With the countries concerned—like Australia, India, ASEAN, U.K., and France—we will fortify the cooperation toward the realization of a free and open Indo-Pacific. We will enhance and expand our efforts. We agreed on that. Since President Trump came to the office, Japanese companies decided on new investment to the tune of $24 billion to the United States, thereby creating 45,000 new jobs. Daring tax reform that President conducted, thanks to that, automotive and energy related to Japanese companies are making investments in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Alabama, and Kentucky, and others. They are—they have decided to make new investments.
Those contributing most in the U.S. economy are the Japanese companies. It's been only 1 month since the last summit talks. In a short span of 1 month, Japanese companies increased their investment to the United States by $1 billion. Under—with this vigorous investment appetite, Japanese companies are deciding to make investment to the United States one after another. U.S.-Japan economic relationship is developing in a major way, in a modality of bringing in win-win situations.
Following the joint statement of September, last year, Minister Motegi and Ambassador Lighthizer, USTR, are proceeding with the discussion, and I welcome this discussion. In today's talks between myself and the President Trump, we should achieve early outcome based upon the trustful relationship between our two nations. We shall accelerate the pace of discussion. We agreed on that.
Next month, at G-20 Osaka summit, President Trump—I am going to welcome him again in Osaka. Looking forward to it. For the success of G-20 summit, U.S.-Japan cooperation is indispensable. I will continue to collaborate closely with President Trump.
Yesterday I was able to talk with President Trump on a variety of issues in a relaxed atmosphere, like the game of golf, watching sumo wrestling, as well as the dinner where our spouses joined. Your friendship and trustful relationship was even more enhanced.
The exuberance of joy shown by the crowd that I witnessed in the stadium, as well as the frenzied excitement of the general public when President—when Presidential Cup was handed to Asanoyama, the champion, indeed, a new page was added to the prestigious history of sumo. Donald, I thank you very much.
Tomorrow, together with President Trump, I will go to Yokosuka and visit our escort ship anchored in Yokosuka and show the strong bond of U.S.-Japan alliance to the people in Japan and the world.
Lastly, once again, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Donald and Madam Melania for honoring us with your visit to Japan as the first state guests of the new era of Reiwa.
Thank you.
Moderator. Then, President Trump of the United States, floor is yours.
President Trump. Prime Minister Abe, the First Lady and I are profoundly honored to return to this very beautiful nation as Japan's first state guests following the enthronement of His Majesty the Emperor. On behalf of the United States, we want to thank the Imperial Family for this gracious invitation and warm welcome. It was really wonderful.
Melania and I are thrilled to be back in the Land of the Rising Sun. It is a true privilege to take part in the splendor of this historic moment and to witness an ancient Japanese tradition as you begin the new imperial era. We look forward to seeing the new Emperor continue his father's extraordinary legacy.
Yesterday Melania and I were delighted to join you, Prime Minister, in attending a sumo tournament—I've always wanted to see a sumo tournament, so true—and they are bigger and stronger than I even thought—at your very impressive and new national arena, where I presented the first-ever U.S. President's Cup to the Sumo Grand Champion. That was something. This morning we participated in a magnificent welcome ceremony with their Majesties the Emperor and Empress at the grand Imperial Palace. Japan's time-honored customs and exquisite culture fill us with a deep sense of admiration. I want to thank all of the people of Japan for welcoming us to this week and sharing your beloved heritage. It is truly an incredible heritage.
This visit has also been a chance for Prime Minister Abe and me to strengthen our close friendship and the friendship between our two nations. The alliance between the United States and Japan is a cornerstone of stability and prosperity in the region and all around the world.
The Prime Minister and I continue our close consultation in pursuit of peace and security on the Korean Peninsula. The essence of our approach is peace through strength. And this is a strong alliance indeed. The U.S.-Japan alliance is steadfast and ironclad. We want peace, and we want stability. We continue to hope that Chairman Kim seizes the opportunity to transform his country through denuclearization. It is a country with tremendous economic and other potential.
The United States also remains committed to the issue of abductions, which I know is a top priority for Prime Minister Abe. Earlier today I met for the second time with a group of Japanese families, who have suffered the unthinkable heartbreak of having their loved ones abducted by North Korea. The United States will continue to support Japan's efforts to bring these abductees home.
Our nations are also cooperating on a number of other vital security issues. The United States supports Japan's efforts to improve its defense capabilities, and in recent months, we have greatly expedited the sale of large amounts of defense equipment to Japan, made in the United States. We make the best equipment in the world.
In 2018, Japan was one of the world's top purchasers of American defense equipment, and it has just announced its intent to purchase 105 brandnew F-35 stealth aircraft, stealth because, the fact is, you can't see them. [Laughter] This purchase would give Japan the largest F-35 fleet of any U.S. ally.
America and Japan's close security ties are grounded in shared values. Our armed forces train and serve together all around the world. Tomorrow I will visit American troops stationed alongside the Japanese Self-Defense Forces right here in Japan. On behalf of all Americans, I want to thank the Japanese people for graciously hosting our servicemembers and military families.
The United States and Japan are also working to improve our economic relationship based on the principles of fairness and reciprocity. We are currently negotiating a bilateral trade agreement that would benefit both of our economies. Our goal is to reduce our trade deficit with Japan, remove trade barriers, and barriers of all kinds so that U.S. exports will really have a fair and very profound footing.
Just over 1 week ago, U.S. beef gained full access to Japanese markets for the first time since 2003. We hope to have even more to announce on the trade very, very soon.
And finally, today I am pleased to confirm that Prime Minister Abe and I have agreed to dramatically expand our nations' cooperation in human space exploration. Japan will join our mission to send U.S. astronauts to space. We'll be going to the Moon. We'll be going to Mars very soon. It's very exciting. And from a military standpoint, there is nothing more important right now than space. This is an exciting starting point for greater collaboration on many other things.
Mr. Prime Minister, our visit this week is a moving reminder of the strength of the U.S.-Japan alliance and the deep friendship between our people. It is a profound honor to be in Japan at this important moment in your nation's history. For this new imperial era, your nation has chosen the name Reiwa, meaning ""beautiful harmony."" America shares this wonderful aspiration for the future, and I look forward to continuing our tremendous partnership as we work together to bring this noble vision to life.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Moderator. Thank you very much. Now the floor is open for accepting questions. Japanese media first, followed by the press entourage accompanying the President. Japanese person, please raise your hand and recognized by me. Regarding the American press, Ms. Sanders from U.S. will decide the questions. First, the questions from the Japanese media, please.
Q. [Inaudible]—from Yomiuri Newspaper. I have a question to Prime Minister Abe on abduction. Japan-Korea Summit meeting: Do you think that the problem would be resolved in one-time meeting with Chairman Kim? Or do you have to go through plural number of meetings in order to seek solution? By what timeframe would you like to realize the summit talk? Is it going to happen by the end of this year? In that sense—in that case, could there be tripartite discussion involving U.S. as well?
Prime Minister Abe. Regarding the relationship with North Korea, first of all, I have to note the fact that President Trump cracked open the shell of distrust with Chairman Kim Jong Un, shared the bright future beyond the denuclearization, and urging North Korea to act. It's a new approach. I'd like to pay tribute to his new approach.
Most important thing is resolution of abduction issue, and it means that I'm resolved that I have to directly see Chairman Kim face to face without attaching any conditions. I meet him, and then, frankly, and I must have discussion in complete candor.
At the summit talk today, to my resolution as such, President Trump expressed that he will give all-out support. He will spare no efforts in rendering assistance to my efforts. It was a very strong support.
President Trump and family members of abducted victims had a meeting, and President Trump would look into the eyes of the family members directly. And he was listening to the remarks very seriously. We have to resolve this abduction issue. This is the thought that I have, which was shared by President Trump. Once again, looking toward the resolution of abduction issue, I'd like to pay tribute and gratitude to the lavish understanding and support.
Now, including the points that you asked on the topic of a summit talk between Japan and North Korea, as of now, there is no specific goal in sight. But based upon the Japan-North Korea Pyongyang declaration, we want to solve comprehensive issues, pending issues like abduction, nuclear missiles. We must come to terms with the unfortunate past, and we must normalize the diplomatic relations. This line is unchanged. Abduction issue is the most important issue for Abe administration. Family members of abductees have advanced in their age.
As the president of LDP, I have a certain term, your question, sort of, implied. And also, a one-time meeting could resolve the issue? You asked. Irrespective of my term in office, I have to do everything I can, all-out efforts of myself, for the resolution of this issue. As the Prime Minister, I have responsibility as such.
Going forward, I will discharge this responsibility. And in order to do that as the Prime Minister, day in and day out, I will do my best, and all-out efforts I will endeavor.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. The United States first question will go to Vivian Salama of the Wall Street Journal.
North Korea Q. Thanks, Sarah. Mr. President, Prime Minister. Mr. President, I hope you'll indulge me with two questions since we're far from home. The first one is: So if Kim Jong Un is not violating his promise to you by firing small weapons, as you said in your tweet yesterday, what would you consider a violation exactly?
President Trump. Well, first of all, let me say that I think that Kim Jong Un, or Chairman Kim, as some people say, is looking to create a nation that has great strength economically. I think he's very much—I talk to him a lot about it, and he's very much into the fact that—he believes, like I do, that North Korea has tremendous economic potential like perhaps few other developing nations anywhere in the world.
And I think that he is looking to develop that way. He knows that, with nuclear, that's never going to happen. Only bad can happen. He understands that. He is a very smart man. He gets it well.
So I think that he is going to try, at some point. I'm in no rush at all. The sanctions remain. We have our hostages back. We, as you know, are getting the remains, continuing to get the remains. A lot of good things are happening.
And, very importantly, there's been no nuclear testing for 2 years. I looked at a chart the other day. During the past administration, there were many numbers that were very high, like 10 and 12 and 18, having to do with missile launches and nuclear testing. And for the last 2 years, on the bottom, it had zero and zero. So I am very happy with the way it's going. And intelligent people agree with me.
Q. You're not bothered at all by the small missiles?
President Trump. No, I'm not. I am personally not.
Investigation Into Russia's Interference in 2016 Presidential Election/U.S. Economy/U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement 
Q. Okay. Thank you. One more question, Mr. President. Last week, you declared that you won't work with Democrats in Congress until they stop investigating you. So how are you going to explain to your voters when it comes at the expense of some of the promises that you made to them?
President Trump. Well, there's never been a President more transparent. The Mueller report came out: no obstruction, no collusion. No nothing. It's a beautiful report.
The Democrats cannot understand what happened. They really thought they had some people on their side, because, as you know, the people doing the investigation were 18 extremely angry Democrats, many of whom worked for Hillary Clinton and supported Hillary Clinton.
And Bob Mueller, I guess you could say, he wasn't a friend of mine, but he did something that was really the right thing to do. They were very disappointed. They can't get over the fact that—never spoke to Russia, never dealt with Russia, having to do with the subject we're talking about.
And I will say this: That without question, we have done a job like few Presidents have done. The only thing you can say about me, that some people may not like, is that I've created one of the greatest economies anywhere in the world. In fact, when I first met with, yesterday—with Prime Minister Abe, the first thing he did was congratulate me on the incredible economy that we have in the United States. So I think that we will work with them. We have a USMCA. We have a deal with Canada and Mexico that everybody wants, I think. It's all done. And I think they probably want to be doing that.
As you know, Ambassador Lighthizer is here, right now. That's a deal that's gotten universal praise. Unions love it. Farmers love it. Manufacturers love it. You won't have companies leaving and going to Mexico and going to Canada and going like they were for many, many years. It's a great deal. I would imagine that Nancy Pelosi will approve that. I would think it would be very hard not to, but we'll see.
But certainly, as things get approved I would love to sign them. It's only good for our country. I'm only interested in what's good for our country. It's very important. Thank you very much.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Prime Minister, I hope you'll also indulge me with two questions, since I'm far from home. Did you get any reassurances today from President Trump that he will not impose tariffs on cars or auto parts 6 months from now?
President Trump. I want to hear this answer too. [Laughter]
Prime Minister Abe. Well, last year, in September, between—President Trump and I agreed on joint statement regarding—including auto and auto parts. Currently, based upon the joint statement of September, Minister Motegi and Ambassador Lighthizer are discussing and talking about this matter.
So we agreed to accelerate the talk as such; that was the agreement I reached with President Trump.
Q. My second question? So I left my translator, so—[laughter].
President Trump. That's about four. [Laughter]
Q. Yes.
President Trump. I think probably that's enough.
Q. Okay.
President Trump. I think the—your compatriots will not be happy with another question. All right?
Q. Okay. All right. Thank you very much.
President Trump. Thank you very much.
Moderator. Once again, a question from Japanese media. Please.
Trans-Pacific Partnership/China-U.S. Trade 
Q. [Inaudible]—from Nippon Television. I have a question to Prime Minister Abe about the U.S.-Japan trade agreement. Before the election, there are some voices of anxiety expressed from some trade organizations. Now, the tariff level—the maximum that you can have on tariff—is at the same of TPP. Is that unchanged?
Now, regarding the calendar, in the beginning of the talk, in August, there could be a major statement, announcement. Prime Minister, that was the comment of President Trump. Do you agree with him? And in today's talk, what was the timeframe? What was the scheduling of those matters? Between U.S. and Japan, trade friction or trade debate is happening. What was the outlook on that relationship? As for Japan, is there any mitigating role that Japan can take? Prime Minister Abe. Two questions, I guess. Last year, in September, President Trump and I agreed on the joint statement. Based upon that, Minister Motegi and Ambassador Lighthizer, USTR, are vigorously conducting discussions and talks. This time around, Minister Motegi and Ambassador Lighthizer, between them, I think a quite in-depth discussion was held. And that is, I am informed.
With President Trump, we agreed that—let us accelerate the talks between the ministers. So we have joint statement, and that must be the grand premise upon which we must create win-win result, which would be beneficial to both nations. That is my thinking.
Now, next point of question: U.S.-China trade negotiation. I think that was the question. Sino-U.S. relationship, respectively, they occupy number-one and number-two economic powerful position of the world. Between the two countries, stable economic relationship is built. That would benefit not only Japan, but the Asian countries and to the whole world. It's very important that there be stable economic relationship. With a view as such, I hope that, continuously, U.S. and China will go through dialogue in order to seek constructive solution of the problem.
Today, with the President, we discussed economic issues. And the global economy was something that we also addressed. There are a variety of challenges in the global economy we discussed in today's talk.
President Trump. I wanted to add, though, that—very importantly—I have nothing to do with TPP. Okay? Nothing to do. I'm not bound by anything that anybody else signs with respect to the United States. TPP would've destroyed our automobile industry and many of our manufacturers. We are not involved in TPP. So what other countries agreed to is not binding at all on the United States.
As far as China is concerned, they want to make a deal. I think they probably wish they made the deal that they had on the table before they tried to renegotiate it. They would like to make a deal. We're not ready to make a deal. And we're taking in tens of billions of dollars of tariffs, and that number could go up very, very substantially, very easily.
But I think, sometime in the future, China and the United States will absolutely have a great trade deal. And we look forward to that.
Okay? Thank you.
Press Secretary Sanders. The United States second question goes to Jeff Mason of Reuters.
President Trump. Yes, sure, Jeff.
Japan-U.S. Trade/China-U.S. Trade/U.S. Farmers 
Q. Thank you, sir. I'm going to follow Vivian's lead and ask two questions, if I can. First is a follow-up on trade. Can you lay out specifically, Mr. President, what Japan needs to do to avoid auto tariffs? And before you come back to the G-20 in another month or so, do you expect talks with China to get back on track this year at all?
President Trump. First of all, getting to the G-20, I think that we are very much discussing different things with Japan. We have an unbelievably large imbalance—as you know, trade imbalance—which has been there for many, many years; Japan having the big advantage. They are brilliant businesspeople, brilliant negotiators, and put us in a very tough spot. But I think we will have a deal with Japan.
Likewise, I think we will have a deal with China sometime into the future. Many companies are leaving China right now because of the tariffs. China is subsidizing a lot of industry because—you know, foolishly, some people said that the American taxpayer is paying the tariffs of China. No, no, no—it's not that way. They're paying a small percentage, but our country is taking in billions and billions of dollars.
Our farmers—out of all of that money, the tens of billions of dollars—we're giving a relatively small percentage to our farmers, who have really been a focal point of what's gone on with trade. As you know, they've earmarked, and they've gone after the farmer, thinking that if they hurt the farmer, I'm going to negotiate a bad deal for the rest of the country.
I'll tell you, the American farmer, these are patriots. These are great patriots. They don't want subsidy. We've had meetings—and I've had meetings with 32, 35, 40 farmers at one time, numerous times. And they don't want subsidy. I've told that to you before, Jeff. They want a level playing field. That's all they want, because they're better than anybody in the world.
And they've told me. I said, ""You know, I'm going to get you subsidy while China takes advantage of us and China takes advantage of you, by pinpointing you."" They say: ""We don't want subsidies, sir. All we want is a laying play—really, a level playing field.""
The American farmer, these are great patriots. They are unbelievable people. And they're with me, a hundred percent. I believe that we will have a very good deal with China sometime into the future, because I don't believe that China can continue to pay these, really, hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs. I don't believe they can do that.
You know, businesses are leaving China by the hundreds, by the thousands, going into areas that are nontariffed, including the United States, by the way. But they're going to different parts of Asia: Vietnam; frankly, Japan. But they're going to a lot of places, but they're also coming to the United States, because people don't want to pay the tariff.
And if you look, there is no tariff to pay. All you have to do is move your company to the United States. There is no 25-percent tariff.
But with all of that being said, I think that there's a very good chance that the United States and China will have a very good trade deal.
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr./North Korea 
Q. And, Mr. President, a follow-up on North Korea: You tweeted about North Korea yesterday. Do you believe that they violated U.N. resolutions with the short-range missile launch? And does it give you pause at all to be appearing to side with a brutal dictator instead of with a fellow American, the former Vice President, Joe Biden?
President Trump. Well, Kim Jong Un made a statement that Joe Biden is a low-IQ individual. He probably is, based on his record. I think I agree with him on that. But, at the same time, my people think it could have been a violation, as you know. I view it differently. I view it as a man—perhaps he wants to get attention, and perhaps not. Who knows? It doesn't matter.
All I know is that there have been no nuclear tests. There have been no ballistic missiles going out. There have been no long-range missiles going out. And I think that someday we'll have a deal. I'm not in a rush. Tremendous sanctions being put on the country of North Korea.
And, again, Kim Jong Un understands the unbelievable economic potential that country has. It's located between Russia and China, on one side, and South Korea on the other. And it's all waterfront property. [Laughter] It's a great location, as we used to say in the real estate business. And I think he sees that.
And I have to tell you—one other country—I really believe that Iran would like to make a deal. And I think that's very smart of them. And I think that's a possibility to happen also. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr./Former President Barack Obama/Iran 
Q. But in terms of criticism that you're, sort of, supporting a dictator instead of an American Vice President?
President Trump. Well, when I look at what's been done by our Vice President and the President, when I look at the horrible Iran deal that they made, look what happened since I terminated the Iran deal. Look what has happened to Iran.
Iran, when I first came into office, was a terror. They were fighting in many locations all over the Middle East. They were behind every single major attack, whether it was Syria, whether it was Yemen, whether it was individual, smaller areas, whether it was taking away oil from people. They were involved with everything.
Now they're pulling back, because they're got serious economic problems. We have massive—as you know, massive sanctions and other things. I mean, we just said the other day: steel, copper, different elements of what they used to sell. The oil is essentially dried up. And I'm not looking that—to hurt Iran at all. I'm looking to have Iran say, ""No nuclear weapons."" We have enough problems in this world right now with nuclear weapons. No nuclear weapons for Iran.
And I think we'll make a deal. I think Iran—again, I think Iran has tremendous economic potential. And I look forward to letting them get back to the stage where they can show that. I think Iran—I know so many people from Iran. These are great people. It has a chance to be a great country, with the same leadership. We're not looking for regime change. I just want to make that clear. We're looking for no nuclear weapons.
If you look at the deal that Biden and President Obama signed, they would have access—free access—to nuclear weapons, where they wouldn't even be in violation, in just a very short period of time. What kind of a deal is that?
So we can't have that. Plus, there were many other things they did that were very bad. So I don't take sides as to who I'm in favor or who I'm not, but I can tell you that Joe Biden was a disaster. His administration, with President Obama, they were basically a disaster when it came to so many things, whether it was economy, whether it was military, defense. No matter what it was, they had a lot problems. So I'm not a fan.
Q. One question from the Prime Minister, sir. Do you share President Trump's optimism about North Korea and his position about the recent missile launches?
And also, could you tell us—and perhaps tell us what you told the President—what you expect or would like to achieve if you travel to Iran and hold talks with Iran?
Prime Minister Abe. President Trump conducted summit meeting with North Korea together with"," Chairman Kim. He agreed on the denuclearization of Korean Peninsula, and he signed the document. There was great significance in that.
He cracked open the shell of distrust so that the future—bright future—can be shared and urged North Korea to act accordingly. This was a new approach, which I welcome. Of course, North Korean denuclearization, for many years, this was not achieved. But precisely because it was not achieved, difficult as it is, President Trump just said that he will make a challenge with new approach.
So we are neighbor to North Korea. We are most threatened among countries. So, as the Prime Minister of such a country, such act of a Prime Minister—of President Trump and policy, I have a trust in it, and I would like to support it. In this context, the abduction issue is of paramount importance. In Hanoi—at the summit talk in Hanoi, President Trump, on behalf of my thinking, he conveyed and communicated my thinking to Kim Jong Un. And I, as well as the country of Japan, are thankful.
A moment ago, President Trump met with the family members of the abductees, and the family members were very appreciative of President Trump. So his approach is something that everybody wants to have hope. So that was the view of the families of abductees.
Now, the launching of the missiles this time: On the 9th of May, North Korea launched a short-range ballistic missile. This is violating the Security Council resolution. So my reaction is, as I said earlier on, it is of great regret. But, at the same time, between Kim Jong Un and President Trump, certain new approach was taken, and that is something that I'd like to pay tribute to.
In any event, denuclearization of Korean Peninsula is the goal. So U.S., Japan, South Korea, and Europe and other countries will act in cooperation so that the U.S.-North Korean process would be supported.
Q. Iran?
Prime Minister Abe. What about Iran? There was a question about Iran.
Regarding Iran, regarding the JCPA, we have expressed our position at the appropriate timing. Peace and stability of Middle East is very important for Japan and the United States, and also for the international community as a whole. It's very important.
In this context, in order to make contribution for the peace and stability of the region, we would like to discharge whatever we can do. So whatever it is possible for Japan to do, we absolutely would like to do this going forward. Between Japan and the United States, there should be close collaboration so that this tension surrounding Iran should be mitigated and alleviated, and it shouldn't culminate in the armed conflict.
Thank you very much.
Moderator. Thank you very much. With this, we will conclude the press conference—joint press conference—with President Trump and Prime Minister Abe. Thank you very much. Please remain seated while—until the leaders exit the room.
President Trump. Thank you. Thank you."
"June 04, 2019","The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom in London, United Kingdom",Donald J. Trump,"Donald J. Trump, The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom in London, United Kingdom Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/333608",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-theresa-may-the-united-kingdom-london,"Prime Minister May. This week, we commemorate the extraordinary courage and sacrifice of those who gave their lives for our liberty on D-day, 75 years ago. As leaders prepare to gather here from across the world, it is fitting that we begin with a celebration of the special relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States, enduring partners who stood side-by-side on that historic day and every day since.
For generations, at the heart of the transatlantic alliance has been our shared democratic values, our common interests, and our commitment to justice. It is that unity of purpose that will preserve the deep-rooted ties between our people and underpin our nations' security and prosperity for the next 75 years and beyond.
So I am very pleased to welcome the President of the United States of America on this State Visit to the United Kingdom.
President Trump. Thank you very much, Theresa.
Prime Minister May. For the past 2½ years, the President and I have had the duty and privilege of being the latest guardians of this precious and profound friendship between our countries. As with our predecessors, when we have faced threats to the security of our citizens and our allies, we have stood together and acted together.
When Russia used a deadly nerve agent on the streets of our country, alongside the U.K.'s expulsions, the President expelled 60 Russian intelligence officers, the largest contribution towards an unprecedented global response. And in Syria, when innocent men, women, and children were victims of a barbaric chemical weapons attack, Britain and America, along with France, carried out targeted strikes against the regime.
Since we spoke about NATO during my first visit to the White House, we have maintained our support for this crucial alliance. Thanks in part to your clear message on burden-sharing, Donald, we have seen members pledge another $100 billion, increasing their contributions to our shared security. And I'm pleased to announce that NATO will soon be able to call on the U.K.'s Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers and F-35 fighter jets to help tackle threats around the world.
Today we've discussed again the new and evolving challenges to our security, our values, and our way of life. We share the same view about their origin and our objectives in meeting them.
But like Prime Ministers and Presidents before us, and no doubt those that will come after, we can also differ sometimes on how to confront the challenges we face. I've always talked openly with you, Donald, when we have taken a different approach, and you've done the same with me. I've always believed that cooperation and compromise are the basis of strong alliances, and nowhere is this more true than in the special relationship.
Today we've discussed again the importance of our two nations working together to address Iran's destabilizing activity in the region and to ensure Tehran cannot acquire a nuclear weapon. Although we differ on the means of achieving that—as I've said before, the U.K. continues to stand by the nuclear deal—it is clear that we both want to reach the same goal. It is important that Iran meets its obligations and we do everything to avoid escalation, which is in no one's interest. Recognizing our nations are safer and more prosperous when we work together on the biggest challenges of our time, I also set out the U.K.'s approach to tackling climate change and our continued support for the Paris Agreement.
And we also spoke about China, recognizing its economic significance and that we cannot ignore action that threatens our shared interests or values.
As we've deepened our cooperation on security, including our joint military operations and our unparalleled intelligence-sharing, so our economies, too, are ever more tightly bound together. Every morning, 1 million Americans get up and go to work for British companies in America, and 1 million Britons do the same for American companies here.
Our trading relationship is worth over £190 billion a year, and we're the largest investors in each other's economies, with mutual investments valued at as much as $1 trillion. Mr. President, you and I agreed the first time we met that we should aim for an ambitious free trade agreement when the U.K. leaves the EU. And from our positive discussions today, I know that we both remain committed to this.
I'm also sure that our economic relationship will only grow broader and deeper, building on the conversations we had and the ideas we heard from U.K. and U.S. businesses when we met them earlier today.
Tomorrow we will sit down in Portsmouth with our fellow leaders to reaffirm the enduring importance of the Western alliance and the shared values that underpin it. And as we look to the future, in the years and in the generations ahead, we will continue to work together to preserve the alliance that is the bedrock of our shared prosperity and security, just as it was on the beaches of Normandy, 75 years ago.
Mr. President.
President Trump. Thank you very much, Theresa.
Prime Minister May. Thank you.
President Trump. Well, thank you, Prime Minister May. Melania and I are honored to return to London as our nations commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-day in World War II. We want to thank Her Majesty the Queen, who I had a lovely dinner with the last night—a fantastic person, fantastic woman—for so graciously inviting us to this state visit. It was very, very special.
Our thanks as well to Prime Minister and Mr. May for the warm welcome they've given the First Lady and me, as we remember the heroes who laid down their lives to rescue civilization itself. On June 6, 1944, tens of thousands of young warriors left these shores by the sea and air to begin the invasion of Normandy and the liberation of Europe and the brutal Nazi occupation. It was a liberation like few people have seen before. Among them were more than 130,000 American and British brothers-in-arms. Through their valor and sacrifice, they secured our homelands and saved freedom for the world.
Tomorrow Prime Minister May and I will attend a commemoration ceremony in Portsmouth, one of the key embarkation points for the invasion. More than 1½ million American servicemembers were stationed right here in England in advance of the landings that summer. The bonds of friendship forged here and sealed in blood on those hallowed beaches will endure forever.
Our special relationship is grounded in common history, values, customs, culture, language, and laws. Our people believe in freedom and independence as a sacred birthright and cherished inheritance worth defending at any cost. As the Prime Minister and I discussed in our meetings today and yesterday, the United States and the United Kingdom share many goals and priorities around the world.
I want to thank the people of the United Kingdom for their service and partnership in our campaign to defeat ISIS. As we announced a few months ago, ISIS's territorial caliphate in Syria and Iraq has been completely obliterated—defeated.
The United Kingdom is also a key partner in NATO. The Prime Minister and I agree that our NATO allies must increase their defense spending. We've both been working very hard toward that end. And we are very current, and some of them are not. We can't allow that to happen. But I appreciate everything you've done in that regard.
We expect a growing number of nations to meet the minimum 2-percent-of-GDP requirement. To address today's challenges, all members of the alliance must fulfill their obligations. They have no choice. They must fulfill their obligation.
Among the pressing threats facing our nations is the development and spread of nuclear weapons. Perhaps that's our greatest threat. The United States and the United Kingdom are determined to ensure that Iran never develops nuclear weapons and stops supporting and engaging in terrorism. And I believe that will happen.
In protecting our nations, we also know that the border security is national security.
Today the Prime Minister and I discussed our thriving economic relationship—both countries are doing very well—and participated in a roundtable with industry and business leaders, I can say, probably, the biggest business leaders anywhere in the world. Our nations have more than $1 trillion invested in each other's economics.
The United Kingdom is America's largest foreign investor and our largest European export market. That's a lot of importance. As the U.K. makes preparations to exit the European Union, the United States is committed to a phenomenal trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. There is tremendous potential in that trade deal, I say, probably, two and even three times of what we're doing right now. Tremendous potential.
Seventy-five years ago this Thursday, courageous Americans and British patriots set out from this island toward history's most important battle. They stormed forward out of ships and airplanes, risking everything to defend our people and to ensure that the United States and Britain would forever remain sovereign and forever remain free.
Following this press conference, Prime Minister May, Mr. May, the First Lady, my family, and I will visit the legendary Churchill War Rooms beneath the streets of London. I look forward to that. In his famous speech on this day in June 1940, Prime Minister Churchill urged his countrymen to ""defend our island, whatever the cost may be.""
As we mark this solemn anniversary of D-day, we remember that the defense of our nations does not begin on the battlefield, but within the heart of every patriot. Today let us renew our pledge, engraved at the American Cemetery in Normandy and inscribed by President Dwight Eisenhower in St. Paul's Cathedral right here in London, that ""the cause for which they died shall live.""
Prime Minister May, it's been a true honor. I have greatly enjoyed working with you. You are a tremendous professional and a person that loves your country dearly. Thank you very much. Really an honor.
Thank you for the invitation to memorialize our fallen heroes and for your partnership in protecting and advancing the extraordinary alliance between the American and the British people. It's the greatest alliance the world has ever known. Thank you, Prime Minister. Thank you.
Prime Minister May. Thank you.
President Trump. Thank you very much.
Prime Minister May. Thank you very much, Donald.
Thank you. Now we're going to take two questions from the U.K. media and two questions from the American media. I'll start with Beth Rigby.
Mayor Sadiq Khan of London, United Kingdom/Labour Party Leader Jeremy B. Corbyn of the United Kingdom/Public Response to President Trump's Visit to the United Kingdom 
Q. Thank you. Thank you, Prime Minister, President Trump. Beth Rigby from Sky News. For you, President Trump, as you hold talks with the current Prime Minister, the leader of Her Majesty's opposition has been addressing a protest rally against your visit in Trafalgar Square. He says he's disappointed you attacked the London mayor, and he criticized your record on refugees. What do you have to say to him? And is this man someone you could do a trade deal with?
And to you, Prime Minister, do you think that Sadiq Khan is a ""stone cold loser""? Thank you.
President Trump. You're talking about the mayor of London. Is that who you said? Yes? Well, I think he's been a not very good mayor, from what I understand. He's done a poor job. Crime is up. A lot of problems. And I don't think he should be criticizing a representative of the United States that can do so much good for the United Kingdom.
We talked about it before: He should be positive, not negative. He's a negative force, not a positive force. And if you look at what he said, he hurts the people of this great country.
And I think he should actually focus on his job. It'd be a lot better if he did that. He could straighten out some of the problems that he has and probably some of the problems that he's caused.
Thank you.
Prime Minister May. Can I——
Q. [Inaudible]—the leader of the opposition——
President Trump. Jeremy—yes. Yes, he wanted to meet with me, and I told him no.
Q. [Inaudible]—Prime Minister——
President Trump. Yes.
Q. [Inaudible]—what do you say to him?
President Trump. Well, I don't know Jeremy Corbyn. Never met him. Never spoke to him. He wanted to meet today or tomorrow, and I decided that I would not do that. I think that he is—from where I come from—somewhat of a negative force. I think that the people should look to do things correctly as opposed to criticize. I really don't like critics as much as I like and respect people that get things done. So I've decided not to meet.
As far as the protests, I have to tell you, because I commented on it yesterday: We left the Prime Minister, the Queen, the Royal Family; there were thousands of people on the streets cheering. And even coming over today, there were thousands of people cheering. And then, I heard that there were protests. I said: ""Where are the protests? I don't see any protests."" I did see a small protest today when I came, very small. So a lot of it is fake news, I hate to say. But you saw the people waving the American flag, waving your flag; it was tremendous spirit and love. There was great love. It was an alliance. And I didn't see the protesters until just a little while ago, and it was a very, very small group of people, put in for political reasons. So it was fake news. Thank you.
Prime Minister May. And I would say to both the mayor of London and to Jeremy Corbyn: The discussions that we have had today are about the future of this most important relationship between the U.S. and the U.K.
As the President described it: the greatest alliance the world has seen. It is this deep, special relationship and partnership between the United States and the United Kingdom that ensures our safety and security, and the safety and security of others around the world too. And it is this relationship that helps to ensure there are jobs that employ people here in the U.K. and in the United States that underpins our prosperity and our future. That is a relationship we should cherish. It is a relationship we should build on. It is a relationship we should be proud of.
Mr. President, would you like to——
President Trump. It's very big, and this really is a very big and important alliance. And I think people should act positively toward it, because it means so much for both countries. It means so much and it's been so good.
Steve Holland [Steve A. Holland, Reuters], yes. Go ahead, Steve.
British Exit From European Union 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. Is that on? There. What is your current view on Brexit, sir? Should Britain leave the European Union if there is no agreement by October 31?
And for the Prime Minister, what would be the ramifications for the U.K. if there is not a deal?
President Trump. Well, I don't like to take positions in things that I'm not, you know, really—I understand the issue very well. I really predicted what was going to happen. Some of you remember that prediction. It was a strong prediction, made at a certain location, on a development we were opening the day before it happened. And I thought it was going to happen because of immigration more than anything else, but probably, it happens for a lot of reasons.
But I would say, yes, I would think that it will happen and it probably should happen. This is a great, great country, and it wants its own identity. It wants to have its own borders. It wants to run its own affairs. This is a very, very special place. And I think it deserves a special place. And I thought maybe for that reason—and for others—but that reason, it was going to happen.
Yes, I think it will happen, and I believe the Prime Minister has brought it to a very good point where something will take place in the not-too-distant future. I think she's done a very good job. I believe it would be good for the country, yes.
Prime Minister May. And from my point of view, I believe it is important for us to deliver Brexit. We gave that choice to the British people. Parliament overwhelmingly gave the choice to the British people. We should now deliver on that choice. I continue to believe that, actually, it's in the best interests of the U.K. to leave the European Union in an orderly way with a deal. I think we have a good deal. Sadly, the Labour Party and other MPs have, so far, stopped us from delivering Brexit and that deal.
But we will—but obviously, this is an issue that is going to continue here in the U.K. I think the important thing is we deliver Brexit. And once we're out of the European Union, we will be able to do what we've been talking about today and develop not just that free trade agreement, but a broader economic partnership into the future.
United Kingdom-U.S. Security Cooperation 
Q. If I could just follow up on a related matter: Mr. President, are you prepared to impose limits on intelligence-sharing with Britain if they do not put in place some restrictions on Huawei?
President Trump. No, because we're going to have absolutely an agreement on Huawei and everything else. We have an incredible intelligence relationship, and we will be able to work out any differences. I think we're not going to have it. We did discuss it. I see absolutely no limitations. We've never had limitations. This is a truly great ally and partner, and we'll have no problem with that. Okay?
Prime Minister May. Thank you. Francis.
United Kingdom-U.S. Trade 
Q. Mr. President, Francis Elliott from the Times. Do you agree with your Ambassador that the entire economy needs to be on the table in a future trade talk—trade deal, including the NHS?
And, Prime Minister, are you tempted to take the Prime Minister up—take the President up on his word and stick around for a bit until the trade deal is done?
President Trump. I think we're going to have a great trade deal, yes. I think we're going to have a great and very comprehensive trade deal——
Q. With the NHS? With the NHS? Should the NHS be on the table, sir?
President Trump. I can't hear him. What?
Q. The Health Service. Should the Health Service?
Prime Minister May. It's the National Health Service. He says, ""Should the National Health Service be on the table?""
President Trump. Look, I think everything with a trade deal is on the table. When you're dealing in trade, everything is on the table, so NHS or anything else. There are a lot more than that. But everything will be on the table, absolutely. Okay.
Prime Minister May. But the point about making trade deals is, of course, that both sides negotiate and come to an agreement about what should or should not be in that trade deal for the future.
And as regards to your second question, Francis: Nice try, but no. [Laughter] Look, I'm a woman of my word.
Mr. President, would you like to——
President Trump. John [John Roberts, Fox News], please.
Border Security/Mexico-U.S. Trade/Republican Party 
Q. Mr. President, thank you. Mr. President, domestically, in recent days, Mexico has stepped up apprehensions and deportations of Central American migrants.
President Trump. That's good.
Q. This could possibly be in response to your threat of tariffs. Has Mexico——
President Trump. Not ""possibly be."" Q. Has Mexico done enough to avoid tariffs, which will be imposed in some 6 days from now? And——
President Trump. No, we haven't started yet.
Q. But the threat is out there?
President Trump. Yes, the threat is out there, but we haven't really started yet. No, this will take effect next week, the 5 percent.
Q. And what do you think of Republicans who say that they make take action to block you imposing those tariffs?
President Trump. Oh, I don't think they will do that. I think if they do, it's foolish. There's nothing more important than borders. I've had tremendous Republican support. I have a 90-percent—94-percent approval rating, as of this morning, in the Republican Party. That's an alltime record. Can you believe that? Isn't that something? I love records. [Laughter] But we have a 94-percent approval rating in the Republican Party.
I want to see security at our border. I'm going to see great trade. I'm going to see a lot of things happening. And that is happening.
And as you know, Mexico called. They want to meet. They're going to meet on Wednesday. Secretary Pompeo is going to be at the meeting, along with a few others that are very good at this. And we are going to see if we can do something.
But I think it's more likely that the tariffs go on. And we'll probably be talking during the time that the tariffs are on and they're going to be paid. And if they don't step up and give us security for our Nation—look, millions of people are flowing through Mexico. That's unacceptable. Millions and millions of people are coming right through Mexico. It's a 2,000-mile journey. And they're coming up to our border.
And our Border Patrol, which is incredible, they're apprehending them, but our laws are bad, because the Democrats don't want to pass laws that could be passed in 15 minutes, that could be passed quickly. In 1 day, it could change.
But even beyond the laws, Mexico shouldn't allow millions of people to try and enter our country. And they could stop it very quickly, and I think they will. And if they won't, we're going to put tariffs on. And every month, those tariffs go from 5 percent, to 10 percent, to 15 percent, to 20, and then to 25 percent. And what will happen then is, all of those companies that have left our country and gone to Mexico are going to be coming back to us. And that's okay. That's okay.
But I think Mexico will step up and do what they should have been done. And I don't want to hear that Mexico is run by the cartels and the drug lords and the coyotes. I don't want to hear about that. A lot of people are saying that. Mexico has something to prove. But I don't want to hear that they're run by the cartels. You understand. You report on it all the time. A lot of people do. That would be a terrible thing.
Mexico should step up and stop this onslaught, this invasion into our country, John.
British Exit From European Union 
Q. And, Prime Minister May, you tried three times to get a deal on Brexit. At this point, do you believe that a deal on Brexit is possible, or is this a Gordian knot? President Trump says that you didn't take his advice in terms of negotiation. Should you have? Would that have made a difference?
And, President Trump, if I could ask a follow-up: You had a conversation with Boris Johnson. Could we ask what you spoke about? And will you meet with Michael Gove today? Prime Minister May. Well, first of all, on the first issue, as I said in answer to an earlier question, I still believe—I personally believe—that it is in the best interest of the U.K. to leave the European Union with a deal. I believe there is a good deal on the table. Obviously, it will be for whoever succeeds me as Prime Minister to take this issue forward.
What is paramount, I believe, is delivering on Brexit for the British people. And I seem to remember the President suggested that I sued the European Union, which we didn't do. We went into negotiations, and we came out with a good deal.
President Trump. Yes. That's not such a—I would have sued, but that's okay. [Laughter] I would have sued and settled, maybe. But you never know. [Laughter] She's probably a better negotiator than I am, Jeremy.
But you know what? She has got it, in a sense, John. That deal is teed up. I think that deal is really teed up. I think they have to do something. And perhaps you won't be given the credit that you deserve if they do something, but I think you deserve a lot of credit. I really do. I think you deserve a lot of credit. Okay?
Yes, John.
Member of Parliament Boris Johnson and Labour Party Leader Jeremy B. Corbyn of the United Kingdom 
Q. And Boris Johnson and Michael Gove?
President Trump. So I know Boris. I like him. I've liked him for a long time. He's—I think he'd do a very good job. I know Jeremy. I think he'd do a very good job. I don't know Michael. But would he do a good job—Jeremy? Tell me. [Laughter]
Okay?
Prime Minister May. Okay.
President Trump. Good. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much."
"June 12, 2019",The President's News Conference With President Andrzej Duda of Poland,Donald J. Trump,"Donald J. Trump, The President's News Conference With President Andrzej Duda of Poland Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/333628",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-andrzej-duda-poland-0,"President Trump. Thank you very much. Please. Today Melania and I are honored to welcome President Duda and Mrs. Kornhauser-Duda of Poland back to the White House. They've become friends. We last hosted them in Washington, in September, and it's wonderful to see you both again. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Great honor.
Since our last meeting, the unbreakable bonds between the United States and Poland have grown even closer. This year, as our nations mark 100 years of diplomatic relations, the U.S.-Polish alliance is stronger, by far, than ever before.
Earlier today President Duda and I signed a joint declaration affirming the significant defense cooperation between our nations. And, as the declaration makes very clear, the United States and Poland are not only bound by a strategic partnership, but by deep, common values, shared goals, and a very strong and abiding friendship.
Our people are united by the enduring ties of civilization, culture, and history. We respect the rule of law, revere individual rights, and prize our timeless traditions. We embrace country, faith, family, and freedom.
Over the past century, brave American and Polish patriots have repeatedly stood together to defend our sovereignty, our liberty, and our noble way of life. When I was last in Poland, I was very proud to stand among veterans of the Warsaw Uprising and recall their incredible courage in the face of Nazi tyranny. Today we honor the sacrifices of all those who came before by doing our part to safeguard our independence and strengthen the incredible U.S.-Polish alliance.
As stated in the joint declaration, the United States and Poland continue to enhance our security cooperation. Poland will still provide basing and infrastructure to support military presence of about 1,000 American troops. The Polish Government will build these projects at no cost to the United States. The Polish Government will pay for this. We thank President Duda and the people of Poland for their partnership in advancing our common security.
Poland's burden sharing also extends to the NATO alliance, where it is among 8 NATO allies, including the United States, currently meeting the minimum 2 percent of GDP that's for defense spending. And Poland is there. And you've been there from a very early date, and we appreciate that very much. And we've been there also. There's been a total of 8—8 out of 28, and the rest are coming along. Because nations, at my urging, have paid more than $100 billion more toward the NATO defense.
Last month, I was very pleased that Poland announced the intent to purchase 32 American-made F-35 fighter aircraft, like you just saw. Moments ago, we witnessed that impressive flyover of this cutting-edge F-35 as it flew over the White House and actually came to a—pretty close to a halt over the White House. I was saying, ""What's wrong with that plane? It's not going very fast."" [Laughter] But it's an incredible—it's an incredible thing when you can do that. That plane can land dead straight, and it's one of the few in the world that can do that. Considered to be the greatest fighter jet in the world.
I applaud President Duda for its efforts to strengthen and modernize Poland's defenses. I also want to congratulate Poland for its progress on meeting U.S. criteria for entry into the Visa Waiver Program. Today our country signed a Preventing and Combating Serious Crimes agreement, a significant and necessary step for Poland's entry into the program. Though we still have some work to do, we hope to welcome Poland into the Visa Waiver Program very soon, and that's a very big deal.
Both of our nations understand that immigration security is national security. In our meeting, President Duda and I discussed the vital issue of energy. Reliance on a single foreign supplier of energy leaves nations totally vulnerable to coercion and extortion. For this reason, we support Poland's construction of the Baltic pipeline, which will help European countries diversify their energy sources. It's desperately needed, and that's the way to go.
During the past year, Poland has also signed approximately 25 billion dollars' worth of new contracts with U.S. firms to buy more than 6 billion cubic meters of U.S. liquefied natural gas. Today our nations just signed another contract for an additional 2 billion cubic meters worth approximately $8 billion.
So between the planes and the liquefied natural gas and many other things that Poland is doing—which is doing very well because Poland is doing very, very well—we appreciate it. Thank you very much, Mr. President.
Our countries also signed an agreement to expand U.S.-Polish civil nuclear cooperation, which will likewise advance Poland's energy and security and deepen our bilateral commercial ties.
Economic relations between the U.S. and Poland are thriving. We're committed to further expanding commerce based on fairness and reciprocity, perhaps my favorite word.
Across many critical areas—from defense and diplomacy, to energy and economics—the alliance between the United States and Poland is reaching extraordinary new heights in 2019. Our longstanding partnership demonstrates the enormous possibilities for the world when two strong and independent nations unite in common purpose and in common cause.
President Duda, it's a honor to have you with us. And, Mrs. Duda, thank you very much for being here. We usher in a very exciting new era in U.S.-Polish alliance. It's a very special alliance with very special people. We build a future of promise and prosperity for the American and the Polish people. And, again, our relationship is an extraordinary one, and it's going to remain that for a long, long time.
Thank you very much, Mr. President. Thank you.
President Duda. Distinguished Mr. President, wonderful First Lady of the United States of America, distinguished Ministers, all distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:
First and foremost, together with my wife, we would like to thank you very much, Mr. President Donald Trump. Thank you also to the First Lady Melania Trump for this invitation to Washington. Thank you for this possibility of holding another, within the last 10 months, official visit to the United States here at the White House.
This clearly demonstrates how close and how good contacts are today between Poland and the United States. Mr. President, all of us hope that you will visit us in Poland, in September, and that we will be able, together, to commemorate the memory of all those who fell and who perished during the Second World War, which started on the 1st of September, 1939, in Poland through the attack of Nazi Germans on our country. And soon, unfortunately, our country vanished from the map of Europe after the attack of the Soviet Union, against Poland, together with Nazi Germany.
That is our history. It's a very difficult one. And today, we firmly believe that the true ally of Poland, but also a true ally of a free Europe, is precisely the United States of America, who helped that very Europe in such a huge way to win the Second World War and later to establish an independent, sovereign, and free world, which later turned into the European Union.
It exists until this day, and thanks to God. Also thanks to the support of the United States, through the support of subsequent Presidents since 1989; thanks to the great movement of Solidarity; thanks to the great determination of the Polish nation.
Also, we are part of the free world. Also, Poland, which liberated itself from behind the Iron Curtain, which later led to the collapse of the Iron Curtain through the votes of the people casting elections in 1989. In those elections, people said no to the Communists. Also, Poland can develop today as an independent and truly sovereign country, a country which wants to build the European community and a country which also wants to build the Euro-Atlantic community.
In our understanding, this is an absolutely key element of peace and good cooperation across the globe. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Thank you that for sure you are among those Presidents of the United States who understand how it works perfectly. You understand that when the U.S. looks at Europe, when it looks at the security of the European states, it plays a key role for the peace around the globe. It is of key importance for a peaceful development of democratic states and democratic communities.
Thank you, Mr. President, for this extreme kindness towards Poland and perfect understanding of Polish matters, which you showed to us in 2017 during your visit to Poland, during your memorable speech that you gave at the Monument of the Warsaw Uprising where so immensely important words for Polish people fell, which are of historic importance to our nation and to Europe. They showed what Poland means and who Poles are.
Mr. President, thank you for uttering those words back then. And thank you also for this policy which is being implemented right now, which demonstrates that you are this kind of man and this kind of a politician who not only speaks, but to whom first and most important are the deeds. The most important are the deeds.
And whenever you say, Mr. President, ""Make America Great Again,"" it means ""make"" not ""say."" And this precisely is of crucial importance, hence the agreements that we are signing; hence two agreements between our two states concluded today: two memorandums of understanding, which we signed just a moment ago. One of them I signed personally concerning the security and military cooperation.
As you mentioned, sir, there will be more American troops in Poland. This is going to be an enhanced cooperation. It's going to be an enduring presence, which hopefully will increase gradually in terms of the number of troops, but also in terms of infrastructure which is very important.
Thank you also for the decision to establish the division headquarters in Poland. This is of huge importance not only to Poland, but also to our part of Europe, to Central Europe, to the Baltic States, and to all those to whom the enhanced forward presence was established, of the United States and other NATO states, along NATO's eastern flank. I'm deeply grateful for that.
But thank you, Mr. President, also for the remaining agreements. Thank you for this agreement which talks about Preventing and Combating Serious Crimes. It moves us closer to Visa Waiver Program between Poland and the United States—which to you, Mr. President, and to me, and, first and foremost to Poles, is so important—is of such a crucial importance.
Thank you, Mr. President, also for excellent energy cooperation that we have in terms of LNG supplies. We talked about this in 2017, in Warsaw, during our meeting, that gas from the United States should be delivered to Poland. And it is delivered. And we are signing more contracts. And gas tankers from the United States are coming to the Port of Swinoujscie today. And the gas from the United States has become a fact in Poland and in our part of Europe.
Thank you, Mr. President, that there are going to be more supplies. I'm very happy about that, because to us, it means diversification of sources of supplies. It also means the development of gas security. To us, it also means good business, just as I do really believe is a good business for the United States of America. But thank you also for the agreement cooperation in terms of nuclear energy used for civil purposes.
I hope that, together, we will be able to implement this program with the benefit for environment protection with the benefit for—[inaudible]—protection across the globe and also for the development of the security of my homeland.
Mr. President, I am deeply grateful for this visit. I'm pleased that, thanks to this presence, we're able to show the very good cooperation that we have between Poland as part of the European Union and the United States.
And I firmly believe that thanks to your incredible view of the European matters, and thanks to your understanding to our Polish matters and to the meanders of our history, this cooperation is going to develop better and better, first and foremost also with the benefit for the United States whose interests you are representing, Mr. President, and also understanding the rest of the world.
Thank you very much for that.
President Trump. Thank you. Thank you very much. We'll take a few questions. Emerald [Emerald Robinson, One America News Network], OAN.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
President Trump. Thank you.
Russia-Germany Nord Stream II Natural Gas Pipeline/Poland-U.S. Relations 
Q. Earlier in the Oval Office, before you did your meeting with President Duda, you were quite critical of Germany, as you talked about possibly moving troops from Germany to Poland. Do you think that doing a move like that will put pressure on Germany to meet their defense spending requirements?
President Trump. No, I don't think so. I just will tell you very strongly that I think Germany is making a tremendous mistake by relying so heavily on the pipeline. And I think it's a tremendous mistake for Germany. But again, Germany is running their affairs. And they'll do just fine.
But I was critical. I had been critical of it. It's a tremendous amount of their energy will be supplied by that pipeline.
At the same time, having nothing to do with Germany, Poland said that we would like to build a facility, a great facility, and we'd like to have you come to that facility. So we're going to be there with a limited force, but we'll be there. And we appreciate Poland doing what they're doing. It's a great location. It's a tremendous—it's a tremendous plant, tremendous facility. And we—it's our honor to be there.
Poland has been a tremendous friend of ours for a long time. And when Melania and I were there not so long ago, it was a very special day. I think it was a special day for Poland, also. But it was a very special day for our country. So I appreciate that. And our relationship is just a very strong one.
North Korea Q. And, if I may, would you indulge me with one more question before I get——
President Trump. Yes, go ahead.
Q. ——to ask President Duda a question? In more recent news, yesterday you revealed you got another letter from Kim Jong Un. And today we hear of the potential thawing of relations between South Korea and North Korea as Kim Jong Un is sending his sister to South Korea. Now, could you give us an update on more of what was in that letter? And is there a third summit in the works?
President Trump. He just wrote me a very nice letter, unexpected. And someday, you'll see what was in that letter. Someday, you'll be reading about it. Maybe in 100 years from now, maybe in 2 weeks. Who knows? But it was a very nice letter. It was a very warm, very nice letter. I appreciated it. Okay?
Q. Thank you.
President Trump. Good. Thank you very much.
Q. And then, if I may, for President Duda?
President Trump. Please.
Poland-U.S. Military Cooperation 
Q. You said you were thankful for the commitment that the President made for more troops today, but you hinted that you would like to see more. Ultimately, what is the number of troops that you'd like to see in Poland? U.S. troops.
President Duda. Madam, this, of course, is always going to be the decision of the United States of America.
President Trump. He'd like to see 250,000 troops. [Laughter] We'll keep it slightly below the—[inaudible].
President Duda. It's always going to be up to the United States to decide how many troops there will be sent to Poland—to which allied nation.
Of course, I know that this depends on the needs and on the real situation on the ground. Of course, I know that this depends on the needs and on the real situation on the ground. Of course, we are very pleased that the U.S. troops are present by giving an evidence to the sustainability and strength of the alliance. And the U.S. soldiers are kindly treated in Poland. They are received as friends.
And we are happy that they are serving in our country. We would like those bonds between Poland and the United States to become even tighter. And we are trying, also, to create the best possible conditions for American soldiers.
Poland-U.S. Relations 
Q. Thank you very much, President Trump. Thank you very much, President Duda. I have questions to both of you actually.
President Trump, you plan to enhance U.S. military presence in Poland. Last year, you promised you would enhance our military cooperation, training, intelligence, missile defense, and it's happening right now. People of Poland still remember your incredible speech in Warsaw. Why Poland is such an important ally for you?
President Trump. I just have a very warm feeling for Poland. I always have. And it's now even beyond that because of the relationship, which we've developed with your President and First Lady. And it's just—they're very—they're incredible people: hard-working, smart, very industrious people. And what they've done with the country over the last 5 years has been something that the world has watched and the world has marveled at.
I've just liked Poland. So when the President came and he asked me whether or not we'd consider this, I said, ""I will consider it."" And now, because of his leadership, we're able to do that. And that's fine with me. That's great. Great people. And say ""hello.""
Q. So I understand we can—we'll see you in September, in Warsaw, correct?
President Trump. We are looking very seriously at going back to Poland. And I don't know what the President has in store for us, but we're thinking about going back sometime in September. Yes. Thank you.
Q. Amazing. Thank you. Thank you very much.
President Trump. Thank you.
Q. A question to President Duda. Mr. President, so far, we have been talking about a rotational presence of U.S. troops in our country. Right now we are talking about permanent or enduring presence. What does that mean in concrete terms? And when can we expect those additional U.S. troops to arrive?
President Duda. I understand it in the follow way: President Donald Trump and myself are implementing a very calm but consistent policy in terms of security. The presence of the United States in Poland—the military presence—the presence of U.S. troops, which today is about 4,500 troops present on a permanent basis. In other words, it is a rotational presence but it is back-to-back presence. So there is no moment where there are no American troops in the territory of Poland.
And today we signed a document and further cooperation: a Joint Declaration on Defense Cooperation Regarding the United States Force Posture in the Republic of Poland. This is of a breakthrough character because it moves us to another era. So far, we can say that the Americans were testing the situation in Poland: how it looks, how it feels; what about logistics; whether it is possible to stay in Poland and to successfully attain the goals and implement the tasks of defensive nature.
I think that the commanders of U.S. Army are convinced that this is simply possible. And today, the documents speaks about this enduring presence, the presence which is a fact and which will stay there.
It is a rotational presence as it is because this is most beneficial from today's perspective to train soldiers through rotational presence. By having rotational presence, more soldiers can come to a country, be present there, look at a culture and the condition in place in a given country. So this is beneficial for this barely understood—a development of the Armed Forces. Therefore, this is an enduring presence. However, it is implementing this particular way.
And we hope it's going to develop 1,000 troops, mentioned by President Trump today, which is also—the numbers stipulated in the agreement signed today is very differentiated. It is not one single unit. We are talking about special operation forces. We are talking about logistics component. We are also talking about the already-mentioned division headquarters.
So there is a multitude of forums in which the United States is going to be gradually ever-more present in our territory, from the military standpoint. And this will encompass different fields of cooperation. So we're not talking about just one single beat, but we're talking about a more comprehensive cooperation. We're talking about logistics health protection for soldiers and a number of other elements happening. Please remember that right now there is this missile defense facility being built in Redzikowo. So, talking about the elements of Polish-American cooperation, there are more and more of these elements, and the number is growing. I'm very happy with that. Thank you very much.
President Trump. Let's see, who do I like? [Laughter] Nobody. That's the end. [Laughter]
Go ahead. Yes.
Q. Me? Mr. President, thank you very much. President Duda, thank you.
President Trump. I was pointing at you, but you can go ahead. Here we go.
Q. You were pointing to——
President Trump. I was actually pointing to my friend with that beautiful hat on, but that's okay.
Q. Jeff Mason [Jeff Mason, Reuters]. All right, well——
President Trump. You'll give up your question?
Q. Well, I'll give him my follow-up question.
President Trump. You'll give up your——
Q. We can share it.
Q. We'll share the question.
President Trump. Huh? Okay. We'll share it. Good.
North Korea 
Q. Mr. President, you seemed to suggest, yesterday, that you're essentially committing to not spying on North Korea. Is that what you meant? Were those comments interpreted accurately? If so, why?
President Trump. No, it's not what I meant. It's what I said. And that's—I think it's different than maybe your interpretation. I think we're going to do very well with North Korea over a period of time. I'm in no rush. The sanctions are on. We got our hostages back. Our remains are coming back; you saw the beautiful ceremony in Hawaii with Mike Pence. We're getting the remains back. There's been no nuclear testing whatsoever. They'd like to do something. I did get, you know, a very—as I said yesterday, a very nice letter from Chairman Kim. And I think we're doing very well.
When I took over as President, I will tell you, it looked like it was going to be war with North Korea. You know that. Everybody knows that. And it was going to be quite brutal. A strong force. We're the strongest force in the world, but that's a strong force.
And we started off a very rough relationship, and I think we have a very good relationship right now. So we'll see what happens. I'm in no rush. I'm in no rush.
But there's been no nuclear testing whatsoever. And when I took over, it was nuclear testing all the time. And if you look back to the last 4, 5, 6 years—but really go back further than that. In all fairness to President Obama, go back 20 years, 15 years. It was, really, a very dangerous situation. I consider it to be different now.
Now, I may change. And if I change, you will know it very quickly. I will be very quick to tell you exactly what's going on. I may change. But right now we have a good relationship, and I think, probably, better than we've had for maybe 25 years, maybe forever. You know, they've been there a long time—the grandfather, the father, the son. And they've been there for a long time, and nobody has done anything except me. And so we'll see how it all turns out. I hope it turns out well for you and for everybody.
Poland-Russia Relations/China-U.S. Trade 
Q. And I'll give my follow-up to Jeff. Very quickly, President Duda, thank you. Do you see Russia as an ally or an adversary?
President Trump. Are you talking to me?
Q. To President Duda.
President Trump. Boy, was that a setup question. [Laughter]
President Duda. I would very much like Russia to be a friend of Poland, because it is our great neighbor. It is a country much bigger than Poland, with a bigger potential than Poland in every single respect, except for one, perhaps. I believe that we have gotten more courage in us—that we are more brave, more courageous, and are able to fight till the end, irrespective of everything.
This is actually what we demonstrated in World War Two, at the Battle of Monte Cassino. We demonstrated that in the Warsaw Uprising. We demonstrated that in many other places around the globe where Polish soldiers died to make sure that Poland is free after the Second World War.
This, unfortunately, did not happen. We found ourselves under the Russian occupation. But even then, for almost 20 years, after World War II, there was this anti-Communist, anti-Soviet underground, which fought against the Soviets, and those people were murdered. Today, we call them ""Unbreakable Soldiers."" We commemorate their memory, although they were dug underground to make it impossible for anyone to find their remains and so that they couldn't have graves built.
So we were always fighting. We always knew how to defend ourselves. Nevertheless, history was brutal towards us. We never had a great friendship with Russia. Russia was always looking out to take our territory. It was a partitioner in Poland for 123 years. Poland did not exist because part of the territory was taken by Russia.
Poles were deported to the east. Then came an aggression on the right—on the recently reborn Poland, which rose in 1918 from the ashes of the First World War. And in 1919, the Soviet Russia attacked Poland. It wanted to grab Poland's territory and bring communism to the west of Europe. It was us who stopped Soviets at Warsaw in 1920.
By the bravery of Polish soldiers, we defeated them during a great battle. And then, we chased them back to the east. And then, they took their revenge on us in 1939 by attacking us, together with Nazi Germany, and murdering our officers in Katyn.
So, madam, as you can see, this friendship is a very difficult one. Today, we are in the following situation: Russia attacked Georgia. Then, in 2014, it attacked Ukraine. And these are facts. These are facts which belong to the recent history.
We would like Russia to be our friend, but unfortunately, Russia again is showing its very unkind, unpleasant, imperial face, and we do not want to be part of Russia's sphere of influence.
And I am happy that today we can speak boldly, also in connection with the military presence of the U.S. and NATO in Poland, that we truly are, first and foremost, in terms of politics, part of the West. Because we have always been part of the West, in terms of culture. We have always been part of the West, because it is from the West from which we adopted Christianity in 966, more than 1,000 years ago. And since that time, we have been part of the West of Europe. We have been part of the great Christian culture of Western Europe.
But we have to stick to this West also, in terms of politics. And this is what we want—and I firmly believe that this is the biggest desire of Polish people—to be part of the West also in terms of politics.
Thank you that the United States is supporting us in this respect.
Q. For the—excuse me.
President Trump. And just to finish, I hope that Poland is going to have a great relationship with Russia. I think it's possible. I really do. I think because of what you've done and the strength—and maybe we help also, because of what we're doing and doing for Poland.
But I hope that Poland is going to have a great relationship with Russia. I hope we're going to have a great relationship with Russia and, by the way, China and many other countries. And we look forward to doing things on North Korea, just to go back to the original part of your question. And we'll see how that works out.
I do want to say, though: We're in no hurry. The sanctions are on. China has actually been helping us quite a bit. And despite our trade differences right now—we thought we had a deal, and unfortunately, they decided that they were going to change the deal, and they can't do that with me. But something is going to happen, and I think it's going to be something very positive.
But we think we're going to get along with a lot of countries that, frankly, did not respect us very much because they were ripping us off for many, many years. And they're not ripping us off anymore.
Jeff.
China-U.S. Trade/Mexico-U.S. Agreement on Border Security and Trade 
Q. Thank you, sir. Regarding China, what is your deadline, if you have one, for China to make progress on trade before you impose the tariffs on the other $325 billion in goods?
President Trump. Well, we're going to be meeting—President Xi and myself—and you know we have a very good relationship. But, again, he's for China, and I'm for the U.S. It's a big difference. And we thought we had a deal. We didn't have a deal. And I would never make something that would be less than what we already had.
We had China opened up to trade. That's a big thing. They've never done that before. We had intellectual property theft taken care of and taken care of beautifully. And all of the sudden, those things started to disappear at the end, after they were fully negotiated.
But that's—you know, that's their decision. I think if they had to do again—and in light of the fact that we have 25 percent on $250 billion of goods coming into the United States. And unlike a lot of countries, they subsidize those goods. We haven't had inflation. And you know, they keep saying that the American taxpayer is paying for it. No. No. Very little.
And what it really does mean is that a lot of those companies that are in China are going to be moving back to the U.S. You have car companies—General Motors, as an example—that built plants in China. Well, that doesn't work out too well when you have the tariff wall up because now they're going to have to get through that and they can't really get through that. So maybe they'll start building plants in the United States instead.
I think that we'll end up making a deal with China. We have a very good relationship, although it's a little bit testy right now, as ","you would expect. I think they really have to make a deal. A lot of companies are leaving China, as you know. It's in all the reports. And they're going to Vietnam and various other places, and they're also coming to the United States to make their product because they don't want to pay the tariff.
And there is no tariff if you do it in the United States. People don't realize that. You know, they say ""the tariff,"" but there is no tariff if you don't do it—you know, if you just do exactly as I say: You bring your company back to the United States.
And as far as Mexico is concerned, which was a very big topic yesterday—and now people are finding out that the reports that were written were totally false—we would never have had a deal with Mexico without imposing tariffs. Once the tariffs were imposed—and they've been trying to make this deal with Mexico for 20 years, 25 years. The older reporters, those great reporters with the very gray hair in the back—you know who I'm talking about; they know exactly what I'm talking about—you would have never made the deal with Mexico.
We have a great deal with Mexico. I actually think we have a much better relationship right now with Mexico because they respect us again. But you would never have had that deal if I didn't impose the tariffs. And those tariffs were ready to go to on Monday morning, and we made the deal on, essentially, Sunday night.
And that extra little page of the deal that you saw that brilliantly—I had gained such respect for you people when I held it up to the sunlight and it was closed, and you were able to read it through the sunlight. That was not anticipated. But regardless, I mean, you knew enough of what it said. And I didn't do it on purpose, but we have a lot of strength in 45 days if we decide to use that strength. Maybe we will, and maybe we won't. But there's a lot of power right now in the border.
And I will say this: Mexico is, right now, doing more for the United States on illegal immigration and all of the problems of crime and other problems on the border than the Democrats. We can solve our problem on the border in 15 minutes if the Democrats would sit down, straighten out asylum—which is a total mess, but very uncomplicated—straighten out asylum, and get rid of the loopholes. It would take, Jeff, 15 minutes.
Okay? Thank you. Please.
China-U.S. Trade 
Q. But just—my original question, sir, was: Do you have a deadline for imposing the 325?
President Trump. No, I have no deadline. My deadline is what's up here. We'll figure out the deadline.
Q. Okay.
President Trump. Nobody can quite figure it out.
Q. And, President Duda, if I could just throw one your way as well: You said in the Oval Office earlier that democracy in Poland was strong. Not all of your European Union counterparts agree with that. How is forcing Supreme Court justices to retire early consistent with democratic principles? And, President Trump, is that something that you support?
President Trump. No.
President Duda. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very complex issue. And it's hard to answer this question because a lot of people in Western Europe—I think also in the U.S.—do not fully understand this problem because they have not grown up in a country such as mine.
I was born in 1972, in a Poland which was in the Russian sphere of influence, in which a career could be made only, actually, when somebody enrolled as member of the Communist Party and who followed these people's power who was the supreme authority. And this is what was happening for many years.
Although, as you know, ladies and gentlemen, as Solidarity movement grew, people were imprisoned, people were tortured, people were killed during the martial law, and after as well—be it openly or in a secret way. And this was the reality of Poland until 1989.
And now imagine, ladies and gentlemen, that no so long ago—a few years ago—I was surprised to discover that, in the Polish Supreme Court, there was a whole group of justices who were issuing sentencing as judges—members of the Communist Party—before 1990, who were even passing sentences during the martial law, sentencing people to prisons based on the law of the Communist martial law.
And when I was asked whether the Supreme Court needs to be reformed, I said ""yes."" If Poland is supposed to be a truly democratic, free, and sovereign country, if it is supposed to be a country we want it to be for our children, for the generation who was born after, in 1989, then for God's sake, those people have to leave. They have to retire. And this is what we did.
As a matter of fact, everything that we were doing was aimed at retiring those people. But, as you can see, unfortunately, although 30 years have passed, they have got influence, the influence which they were building after 1989 where they assumed a new identity of an elite of a new state. So this influence is still strong. This is what I can say.
And let me assure you of one thing: that freedom of speech is absolutely respected in Poland. Poland absolutely respects all constitutional standards, just as in the United States: the right to assemble; the right to the freedom of speech. There is free media in Poland. There is everything that is functioning in a normal democracy.
One can announce what they think, one can demonstrate, one can say what they think. In Poland, people are not attacked during demonstrations as it happens in other Western European countries. Police do not use truncheons or tear gas against people. People can speak their mind. They can express that they're not pleased with something. This is their right in democracy.
Please ask Polish journalists, ""When was the last time—when was the last demonstration in Poland when some kind of tension happened?"" No, it didn't, because in Poland we respect the right to demonstrate and to express your concern, because we believe that this is one of the foundations of democracy. In Poland, there is absolutely free and just elections. All the standards are respected.
So, please, ladies and gentleman, come to Poland and see Poland with your own eyes. Please do not repeat certain stereotypes that are repeated in the West. Poland, today, has got quite a conservative government, that is true. And this government has got certain standards of action. Not everybody subscribes to those standards, especially people of more leftist views. But this is the nature of democracy.
So once you have got one side of the political scene in power, and then people make a different choice and another side of the political stage comes to power. There is nothing extraordinary about that. And this is the change that is happening in Poland.
But when somebody wins the elections, they then have the right to implement the program which they announced before the elections. Excuse me, however, realizing that implementing the program, which you presented in your election campaign, is not only the right, but I think an obligation resting on a politician. And this is exactly what is happening in Poland.
Visa Waiver Program Q. A question for both Presidents. Mr. President, you said just a moment ago that Poland will join the visa waiver program soon. How soon?
President Trump. We think fairly soon. We're doing very well with it. It's a complex situation, as you know. But we're getting very close. We allow very few countries to join, but Poland is one that we're thinking about allowing in. So we'll be making that decision over the next, probably, 90 days.
Q. Sir, will you hope, or do you think that maybe when you are in Poland in September you will make the announcement?
President Trump. I think it's a very good idea. Thank you very much for giving me that idea. [Laughter]
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
[At this point, the reporter spoke in Polish, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Mr. President, the visa waiver program appeared on many occasions but then it did not come into practice. How optimistic are we about the words uttered right now by President Donald Trump?
President Duda. I'm looking at these words optimistic. I'm optimistic about that because I think this is the first U.S. administration which has treated this problem in such a serious way and in such a comprehensive way. So, both.
When we talk with Mr. President, we—the President expresses his deep care about that. Also, when I talk with President, Mosbacher—the U.S. Ambassador to Warsaw—she looks at the problem all the time. And I firmly believe that, in accordance with the law binding the United States—because this is something that I want to stress very strongly—according to the law, binding in the United States, by all the actions which are necessary in this respect such as today's signing of the agreement on preventing and committing serious crimes, I believe that, through all these sanctions, this visa waiver program—covering Poles with visa waiver program—is going to be possible soon. Anyway, that it is going to be possible before the end of the first term of President Donald Trump.
President Trump. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
"June 29, 2019","The President's News Conference in Osaka, Japan",Donald J. Trump,"Donald J. Trump, The President's News Conference in Osaka, Japan Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/333678",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-osaka-japan,"The President. Thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. It's been a really great period of time. I'll be leaving now, as you know, for South Korea. Some of you will be coming with us.
I understand that we may be meeting with Chairman King—Kim. And we'll find out. We spoke with the people. Kim Jong Un was very receptive. He responded. And so we'll see. Because tomorrow we're going to the DMZ. I said, ""While I'm there, I'll shake his hand."" We get along. There's been no nuclear tests. There's been no long-range ballistic tests. Gave us back our hostages, which was great. And a lot of good things are happening over there.
So I let him know we'll be there, and we'll see. I mean, I don't—I can't tell you exactly, but they did respond very favorably.
I want to thank everyone for being here today. That's a lot of press. A lot of press is outside too. They're less happy than you are. [Laughter] But the G-20 summit has been fantastic. Prime Minister Abe has done an incredible job, as he always does. And he hosted it very beautifully.
You know where it's going to be next year, I think. Do most of you know where it's going to be next year? It's going to be in a very great part of the world. And we'll be announcing exactly what's happening. But this was a really good summit and really well done, so professionally done.
This marks my third visit to Japan as President. Melania and I are—we've just left Tokyo a short while ago, as you know—a very short while ago—where we were the first state guests to Their Majesties the Emperor and Empress of Japan. And that was thrilling. First time in 202 years that an event like that took place, so that was quite exciting.
And I'm thrilled to be back. I always like being back in Japan. We've had a great relationship. We've never been closer to Japan than we are right now. Over the past 2 days, leaders from the world's largest economies have convened here at Osaka, which is a tremendous city. You fly over, and you say, ""Does it ever stop?"" It's big. It's beautiful. It's clean. And it's really a—the job they do with industrial manufacturing and lots of other things is really incredible.
We had a very productive conversation with a number of the leaders, of not only nations, but business leaders here in Japan. And together, we put together a lot of ideas and a lot of challenges for the future that we'll be able to meet and get things going very well.
Our meetings also touched on women's economic empowerment. You probably saw that Ivanka Trump was—she's done a fantastic job and also a fantastic job in getting jobs for a lot of people within our country, almost 10 million people. The importance of resilient and secure infrastructure, we discussed that at great length. The need to uphold the rule of law. And the critical importance of achieving a future for international trade that works all of the time for all of the people.
In addition to the working sessions—we had a lot of working sessions; many of you were at the working sessions—I had tremendous bilateral meetings with many of the heads of state. And just some of them are Australia, Japan, India, Germany, Russia, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, China, Turkey, U.K. And I met with Mexico also—with the representatives of Mexico who have done an incredible job. They've really stepped up to the plate. I appreciate it and I want to thank them. They have 6,000 troops at their southern border, by Guatemala, and it's very hard to come in now. And they have—they just ordered—really, it was somewhat of a surprise—16,000 troops at our southern border. Their immigration laws are very strong. Ours are a disaster. Ours are a disgrace to our country. We have loopholes and asylum that—we could fix the asylum very quickly. We could get rid of and fix the loopholes, but we could get rid of the loopholes, and we would have absolutely no problem at the border. But if you watch the debates—if you call them debates, you—whatever they were—they don't really—I think they want open borders, I guess—even though, 4 years ago, they wanted walls to be built.
I heard we just had another judge rule against us on a section of wall, and that's a disgrace. We'll appeal it right away. Ninth Circuit, as usual. They go right into that Ninth Circuit. The good news: I put a lot of judges in, and a number of them are in the Ninth Circuit now. And it's very unfair. It's very unfair when a judge can do what they do, where a judge in a certain area can close down a country. But we also had a big victory last week with the wall. We had a judge in DC who gave us a very big victory.
So we're building a lot of wall. But we had a ruling just yesterday, late, from a judge in the Ninth Circuit, again. So we're immediately appealing it, and we think we'll win the appeal. There was no reason that that should've happened. And a lot of wall is being built, and again, Mexico is doing a real job. Our Border Patrol, they've done incredible work. And ICE is—they're just special people. Law enforcement, generally, is just—they're special.
So, with that, I just want to say that these meetings have been great. The one that I guess most people are interested in is China. We had a great meeting. President Xi. And we've known each for as long as I'm President. And many of you were at the event in China a year ago, when—I've never seen anything like it. The—it was beautiful. We talked about it; we dinner last night, President Xi and a number of us. And it was something really incredible, in Beijing. The red carpet was rolled out for all of us—for this country, for our country.
And we had a great meeting, and we will be continuing to negotiate. And I promised that, for at least the time being, we're not going to be lifting tariffs on China. We won't be adding an additional tremendous amount of—we have, I guess, $350 billion left, which could be taxed or it could be tariffed. And we're not doing that. We're going to work with China on where we left off, to see if we can make a deal.
China is going to start—they're going to be consulting with us, and they're going to start spending money, even during the negotiation, to our farmers, our great farmers in the Midwest. I call them the ""great patriots"" because that's what they are. They're patriots. And China is going to be buying a tremendous amount of food and agricultural product, and they're going to start that very soon, almost immediately. We're going to give them lists of things that we'd like them to buy.
Our farmers are going to be a tremendous beneficiary. You know, if you look at farmers—for 15 years, before I came into the—into this position, the farms and farmers have had a hard time. If you look at that graph, it was down, fairly steeply down. And a lot of it was because NAFTA was a terrible deal.
And we have—I spoke with Nancy Pelosi last night about the USMCA—that's Mexico and Canada. And it's now before them, and they'll have to make a decision. But that's one that the farmers love, the manufacturers love, the unions love. It's a great deal for this country. And NAFTA was, I think, one of the worst trade deals ever made.
Maybe the WTO was worse. The WTO, from the time that happened in '95—from the time that happened, China became like a rocket ship. It was pretty much flatlined, and then, all of a sudden, they joined the WTO, and they became—they went—I mean, they went through the roof. And very much to our liability, it's—we lost tremendous amounts of money over the—from that time. I mean, we just lost tremendous amounts. It was a terrible deal, the WTO, World Trade.
And if you look at NAFTA, NAFTA has been a disaster for our country. The USMCA is a great deal for our country. I think Canada is happy, but they're not happy like we're happy, but they're very happy. It's a good deal for Canada, a good deal for Mexico. They want it. Mexico just approved it in full. Canada is waiting for us to approve it.
I was with the Prime Minister—just left him a little while ago—and they're thrilled with the deal, and we're thrilled. Everybody wants it. And hopefully, it will be a bipartisan deal. I view that. I told that to Nancy Pelosi. I said, ""View this as a bipartisan deal,"" because a lot of the Democrats want it, especially, I would say, the farmers, but really, the industrial areas also. The unions—we've got things on wages, and we've got things on the environment that few people have ever been able to get into an agreement. And it's a very big deal. It's a very big deal. And it's a great deal, tremendous support.
So they have to put it up for a vote. And I think you'll get a great vote in the House, and you'll get a great vote in the Senate. And you'll have a tremendous trade deal between the United States and Canada and Mexico. And it's going to be something very special.
So we spend a lot of time with a lot of countries. We do business with a lot of them. Australia is an example. With Japan, we're negotiating with them, because they send us millions of cars and we send them wheat, which doesn't work. But what happens is Japan is—you probably saw some of the things they're doing—but they're opening up many car companies and factories and plants throughout our country, especially in Michigan. We have a lot of activity in Ohio. Beyond Japan activity, we have a lot of activity now where companies are coming back to our country. We're the hot show. We're the hottest show in town. We're the hottest show in the world right now. Our economy is the best.
One thing that every leader—virtually every leader that I dealt with said is that: ""Congratulations. It's incredible what's happened to the American economy."" We're the best economy in the world. And it's something. And it started from election day. I put it out yesterday because we took a tremendous boost from—the day after I got elected, the stock market went crazy, from that point until essentially now. I think we hit, in certain of the markets, we hit the alltime high again for many, many times. I can't tell you what it was, but many, many times, we broke the record.
And we're—you know, our stock market is great. Our jobs are great. We have the best job numbers, essentially, we've ever had, in some categories—definitely—we've ever had. The minimum, you could say, is in 51 years, but it's really more than that, and now it's going to be more than that.
African American, Asian American—you saw that—Hispanic American: the best numbers in history—the history of our country. We have the lowest unemployment numbers. Best numbers. And many others too. Blue-collar workers are doing fantastic. They're the biggest beneficiary of the tax cuts, the blue collar.
Blue collar. You know, we talk about for the rich; it's really for everybody. And it's also for big companies where they're moving here. And remember who owns the stocks. Because the people that own the stock, it's not the big companies; it's the people with 401(k)s whose numbers are at 60 percent and 70 percent and 42 percent and all different numbers that are tremendously high—where the other spouse thinks that the spouse that's investing in the 401(k) is a supergenius. But those 401(k)s are very high. And if you listen to what I've been listening to—and we're not going to devote anytime to it—but with that kind of an attitude, their 401(k)s are going to crash and the market would crash because, with what they want to do, you would crash the market, and the amount of wealth that would be lost would be incredible.
But I'd rather wait until later in the campaign to say that because, to be honest with you, I want them to go and take these policies and bring them up. I don't want them to change them anytime soon. Let them go have a good time. But it's been very interesting to watch what's happening. Actually, I found it very interesting.
So, with that, we'll take a few questions, and then I'm heading out to South Korea. And I may or may not see Kim Jong Un. But we'll be heading out to South Korea, spend about a day and a half there with President Moon, who is a really good guy. He was here too, as you know. I saw him. I met with him also. And we'll see what happens.
Please, John [John Roberts, Fox News].
Q. Thanks, Katie. Mr. President, thank you so much for joining us here.
The President. Yes.
Chairman of the State Affairs Commission Kim Jong Un of North Korea/China-U.S. Trade/Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. 
Q. We all appreciate it. It's always good to have a chance to ask questions of you directly. Can you tell us a little more about how this China deal may work going forward? Because Chinese officials have told Fox News that they will not make any concessions until all of the tariffs have been lifted. They also want relief on Huawei. They want it taken off the blacklist. They might want you to stop pursuing extradition of Meng Wanzhou. Can you tell us how you see all of this unfolding?
And if you do meet Kim Jong Un at the DMZ tomorrow, would you step across the border into North Korea?
The President. Sure, I would. I would. I'd feel very comfortable doing that. I would have no problem.
With respect to China, basically, we agreed today that we were going to continue the negotiation—which I ended a while back—and we're going to continue the negotiation. We agreed that I would not be putting tariffs on the $325 billion that I would have the ability to put on if I wanted; that—where, you know, we're fairly advanced, depending on where you want to look at and where you want to start. Pretty advanced.
We discussed—we did discuss numerous other things. We mentioned Huawei. I said: ""We'll have to save that until the very end. We'll have to see.""
One of the things I will allow, however, is—a lot of people are surprised—we send, and we sell to Huawei a tremendous amount of product that goes into the various things that they make. And I said that that's okay, that we will keep selling that product. These are American companies, John, that make product. And that's very complex, by the way. Highly scientific.
And in some cases, we're the ones that do it, and we're the only ones that do it. We're the only ones with the technology. What we've done in Silicon Valley is incredible actually. And nobody has been able to compete with it. And I've agreed—and pretty easily—I've agreed to allow them to continue to sell that product so American companies will continue. And they were having a problem. The companies were not exactly happy that they couldn't sell because they had nothing to do with whatever was potentially happening with respect to Huawei. So I did do that. We talked about education and students. Somebody was saying it was harder for a Chinese students to come in. And that's something that if it were—if somebody viewed it that way, I don't. We want to have Chinese students come and use our great schools, our great universities. They've been great students and tremendous assets. But we did discuss it. It was brought up as a point, and I said that will be just like anybody else, just like any other nation.
And we're actually going to a point where, you know, we're looking that if you graduate from a college, because our great companies—we talk about Silicon Valley and other places—we have a problem in this—in our country, that you graduate number one in your class from the best school in the country, and you—they say you have to leave; we can't keep them. And we're going to make it—we're going to call it the ""smart person's waiver."" But we're going to make it so that they can not only stay, but maybe they have access to green cards. We want to keep these people here. We have to keep—yes, go ahead, John.
Q. But are you concerned that—as they did before—China took it most of the way down the road and then say——
The President. Sure.
Q. ——we're going to pull back?
The President. That could happen. But we're holding on tariffs and they're going to buy farm product. So you know—so—but that could happen, John.
This doesn't mean there's going to be a deal, but they would like to make a deal. I can tell you that. And if we could make a deal, it would be a very historic event. You know, we've never really had a deal with China. We have—we've had tremendous deficits. Tremendous amounts of money was put into China, $500 billion a year. And I mean, you know, not just surplus and deficit. I'm talking about real, hard cash. And it should have never, ever been allowed to have happened for all of our Presidents over the last number of years.
Go ahead, please.
Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation 
Q. Yes, Mr. President. Yes, Mr. President, Steve Herman from the Voice of America.
The President. Good.
Q. After your discussions with Prime Minister Abe here, are you still thinking about withdrawing from the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty? And what did the Prime Minister say to you about that?
The President. No, I'm not thinking about that at all. I'm just saying that it's an unfair agreement. And I've told him that for the last 6 months. I said, ""Look, if somebody attacks Japan, we go after them, and we are in a battle—full force in effect."" We are locked in a battle and committed to fight for Japan. If somebody should attack the United States, they don't have to do that. That's unfair.
That's the kind of deals we've made. That's—every deal is like that. I mean it's almost like we had people that they didn't either care or they were stupid. But that's the kind of deals we have. That's just typical.
But I have been—I told him—I said we're going to have to change it. Because—look, nobody is going to attack us, I hope. But you know, should that happen—it's far more likely that it could be the other way—but should that happen, somebody attacks us, if we're helping them, they're going to have help us. And he knows that. And he's going to have no problem with that.
Yes, please. Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I actually have a Russia question, but I wanted to quickly clarify: Is Meng Wanzhou's case also going to need to wait until the very end? Or is it possible the U.S. would drop the extradition effort?
The President. When what? On what?
Q. Ms. Meng from Huawei, the top financial executive.
The President. We didn't discuss Ms. Meng. We didn't—that was not discussed. We did discuss Huawei, but we didn't discuss her situation.
Potential Russian Interference in 2020 Presidential Election/Russia-U.S. Trade 
Q. Okay. Thank you. On Russia, respectfully, it seemed like maybe you didn't really mean it when you said yesterday, ""Don't meddle in our elections, Mr. President."" And then, you guys both started laughing. [Laughter]
The President. Well, I did say it. You're to have to take a look at the words. I did say it. And we had a discussion. We had a great—actually, we had a great discussion, President Putin and myself. I thought it was really a tremendous discussion.
I think they'd like to do trade with the United States. And they have great product. They have great land. They have very rich land. And a lot of oil, a lot of minerals, and the kind of things that we like. And I can see trade going out with Russia. We could do fantastically well. We do very little trade with Russia, which is ridiculous, frankly. So I could see some very positive things happening.
Yes, but as per your question though, I did say it, and I did discuss it a little bit after that too.
Yes, please.
Q. Yes, but—okay.
Russia's Interference in 2016 Presidential Election/Former President Jimmy Carter 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Yesterday former President Jimmy Carter suggested that your Presidency is illegitimate and that you only got the White House with help from Russia. Your reaction to that, sir?
The President. Russia. Russia. Russia. Isn't it crazy?
Okay, Jimmy Carter—look, he was a nice man. He was a terrible President. He's a Democrat. And it's a typical talking point. He's loyal to the Democrats, and I guess you should be.
But as everybody now understands, I won not because of Russia, not because of anybody but myself. I went out—I campaigned better, smarter, harder than Hillary Clinton. I went to Wisconsin. I went to Michigan the night of the vote. I had 32,000 people at 1 o'clock in the morning on election day. I won Michigan. I won Wisconsin. I won Pennsylvania. I won States that traditionally haven't been won by a Republican, for many years haven't been won by a Republican.
And this had nothing to do with anybody but the fact that I worked harder and much smarter than Hillary Clinton did.
Now, I'll say this: Jimmy Carter—I was surprised that he would make a statement. I saw it. It was not a big thing, but I saw the statement. And it's—you know, a lot of Democrats like to make that statement. He's been trashed within his own party. He's been badly trashed. I felt badly for him because if you look over the years, his party has virtually—he's like the forgotten President. And I understand why they say that. He was not a good President. Look at what happened with Iran. That was a disaster. What Iran did to him, they tied him up in knots. The reason Ronald Reagan probably because President. So you know, it's a Democrat talking point.
Yes, please. Go ahead. Jim [Jim Acosta, CNN].
Potential Russian Interference in 2020 Presidential Election 
Q. Yes. Mr. President, if I could follow up on the question about your comments with Vladimir Putin——
The President. Sure.
Q. ——about Russia meddling. You did seem to be joking there with the Russian President. Are we taking that to be wrong?
The President. No.
Death of Saudi Journalist Jamal Khashoggi/The President's Relations With Foreign Leaders 
Q. And what is it with your coziness with some of these dictators and autocrats at these summits? With Muhammad bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, when you were asked about the case of Jamal Khashoggi, you did not respond to that question in front of the Saudi Crown Prince.
The President. I don't know that anybody asked me.
Q. Are you—were you afraid of offending him on that subject?
The President. No, not at all. I don't really care about offending people. I sort of thought you'd know that. [Laughter]
Q. Well, you passed up an opportunity there.
The President. And by the way, congratulations. I understand your book—is it doing well?
Q. It's doing very well, Mr. President. Thank you.
The President. Really?
Q. I'll get you an autographed copy if you'd like one.
The President. Wow. Good. Send it. I want to see it.
Q. Yes, sir. Yes.
The President. Send me a copy.
No, I get along with everybody, except you people, actually. [Laughter] I get along with a lot of people. I have a tremendous relationship with President Xi. Nobody else would have the deal that we have. We're getting tens of billions of dollars from China coming in. A lot of things are happening. And despite that, we're moving along towards something that could be very historic.
But I get along with President Putin. I get along with Muhammad from Saudi Arabia. Look, I spoke to Saudi Arabia when the oil prices, a year ago, were getting very high. And I wasn't so nice. And I said, ""You've got to get some more oil into the system because what's happening is no good."" And they did. And the people are driving at, you know, very low numbers right now. You haven't seen. In the old days, you'd have spikes where the gasoline went to $5 and more, and it wasn't so good.
But I also get along with people that would be perceived as being very nice. You have a lot of very nice leaders of countries. I was with——
Q. But, Mr. President, isn't——
The President. I was with—wait a minute. I was with Prime Minister May today. I was with so many. You take a look. New head of Australia. Look at Japan—Abe. Prime Minister Abe is a fine—they're all fine, as far as I'm concerned. Some are stronger than others. Some are tougher than others. And a lot of people——
Death of Saudi Journalist Jamal Khashoggi 
Q. Mr. President, but if I may, though, Mr. President, on the case of Jamal Khashoggi, you have a lot of journalists in this room who object to what appears to be the Saudi Government's complicity and perhaps orchestration of the assassination and dismembering of a journalist.
The President. Yes.
Q. And when you were given the opportunity to call Muhammad bin Salman out on that, you did not do it. Did you do it privately?
The President. So——
Q. And do you agree that it is despicable for a government to kill a journalist in that fashion?
The President. Yes, I do. I think it's horrible. Or anybody else, by the way.
Q. Yes.
The President. But I think it's horrible. And if you look, and look into Saudi Arabia and you see what's happening, 13 people or so have been prosecuted. Others are being prosecuted. They've taken it very, very seriously, and they will continue to. And I've let everybody know I'm not—I'm very unhappy about that whole event.
But if you look at what's going on—and right now, within Saudi Arabia, they're prosecuting additional people. There's a lot of things happening. At the same time, I will also say—and nobody said—nobody, so far, has pointed directly a finger at the future King of Saudi Arabia. I will say I spoke to his father, Jim. I spoke to his father at great length.
They've been a terrific ally. They're creating millions of jobs in this country. They're ordering equipment, not only military equipment, but $400 billion worth of—and actually, even more than that over a period time—worth of different things. And with that being said, I'm extremely angry and unhappy about a thing like that taking place. But, as of this moment, more than 13 people are being prosecuted. And I hear the number is going to be going up. But it's a good question.
Yes, please.
North Korea/China-U.S. Trade/Federal Aid to U.S. Farmers 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm Ching-Yi Chan with Shanghai Media Group.
The President. Yes.
Q. It's very good to note that you averted the further escalation of trade tension with China. And can you share some details of your interaction with President Xi this time? And also, if I may, another quick question on North Korea. Do you think it's possible that there will be a third one-on-one summit with Chairman Kim——
The President. Oh, sure.
Q. ——within this year?
The President. Oh, it might happen tomorrow. [Laughter] I mean, to be honest. We won't call it a summit. We'll call it a handshake, if it does happen. I don't know that it will, but it could happen. I know I think he'd like to do it, and I wouldn't mind doing it at all. I'm going to be—I'm literally visiting the DMZ.
And so—but I will—as per your question about President Xi, he's a brilliant leader; he's a brilliant man. And you know better than I, he's probably considered to be one of the great leaders in 200 years, in China. And we just have a very—he's strong; he's tough. But he's good. We have a very good relationship. And I said, you know: ""We can't have it where the United States loses this kind of money for the privilege of building up China. It has to be a fair deal."" And he understands that.
But as he said, ""Nobody ever came to us."" It's true. No other President came to him. This would've—my Presidency could be a lot easier, not only for that, but for many other reasons. It'd be a lot easier. But I don't want it to be easy. It's a point in time. I have a chance to do things that nobody else has ever done.
So we're making a deal with China, or we're attempting. And if we don't, we'll go back into—you know, we have a tremendous ripe field of tremendous money that would be coming into our country. But I have a feeling that over a period of time—and again, I'm not rushed, and I told him that I want to get the deal right. It's extremely—I wouldn't even say complicated, but very intricate.
But, in the meantime, I think our farmers are going to end up being the great beneficiary. And what I did with the farmers—because they did lose a certain amount of money—I went to Sonny Perdue, who is our Secretary of Agriculture. I said, ""Sonny, how much money—in the best year—did China spend on our farms, in our farms, buying?"" He said, ""The best year, about $16 billion."" I said, ""Okay, well, we're taking in much more than that now every year in tariffs.""
And I took $16 billion out of those tariffs, and—essentially out of those tariffs—and we're distributing it among farmers who have been hurt because they have been used as a pawn so that China could get a good deal.
But, in the end, the farmers are going to be the biggest beneficiary. But I've made up for the fact that China was, you know, targeting our farmers. Because they know the farmers like me, and I like them. I love them. And they sort of love me, I guess, when you get right down to it. And it was $16 billion—billion. That's a lot of money. But I took it out the tariff money, essentially, and we are in the process of distributing it.
The farmers could not be happier, other than—they're unusual. I had them around a table, many of the farmers, and—about 5 weeks ago—and they said: ""We don't want money. We want just a level playing field."" I said, ""You're right."" Most groups want money. They'll take—any way you want to give it to them they'll take.
The farmers are in a class by themselves in so many ways. They don't want subsidies. They don't want a handout. All they want to do is have a level playing field. They're unbelievable people, and as I said, they're unbelievable patriots.
Jon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News]. North Korea/U.S. Foreign Policy/Iran 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Thank you.
Q. First a quick follow-up. You've made this very public invitation to Kim Jong Un. Will it be a bad sign if he doesn't show up?
The President. No. Of course, I thought of that because I know if he didn't, everybody is going to say, ""Oh, he was stood up by Chairman Kim."" No, I understood that. It's very hard to—he follows my Twitter.
Q. He does?
The President. And it's very hard——
Q. He follows you on Twitter?
The President. I guess so, because we got a call very quickly."," [Laughter] A lot of people follow it. But you know, they've contacted us, and they'd like to see if they can do something. And we're not talking about for, you know, extended. Just a quick hello.
And we get along. I get along with him, and I get along with other people. Like, you know, for instance, on Jim's question, it's a fair question, but I really have great relationships with everybody.
I think—you know, I said a long time ago that maybe I'll be a sleeper on foreign policy. And if you look at what's happened on foreign policy—now, we are working on Iran, and we'll see what happens. I think they'd like to make a deal. I think they'd be very smart to want to make a deal, but we're going to see what happens. I'm okay. I have all the time in the world.
They're doing very poorly. They were doing—they were very brutal when I first came in. Eighteen sites of confliction, meaning, where they were behind. But I think on foreign policy, if you look at what's happening—and the other thing that's happening is we're not being taken for suckers anymore.
I mean, we have countries where we'd lose on defending them, because we defend a tremendous percentage of the world. And they don't pay us for it. And then, on top of it, we lose money with that same country on trade. And it's all changing. And they understand it's changing. And they expect it to change. They can't believe.
Honestly, like, I'd ask Prime Minister Abe—I said, ""How did this happen, where you send us billions and billions of dollars' worth of cars and other things, and we send you practically nothing?"" He said, ""Nobody ever complained."" Same thing with China. I said: ""You know, you send a car to us. We charge you essentially nothing. It's 2½ percent, but basically, you don't have to—there are ways around that. So you send a car to us, and you pay nothing. We send a car to you, made in the United States, and we have to pay 45-percent tariff. How did that happen? He said, ""We just kept lifting it, lifting it, lifting it."" I mean, they're being honest with me. ""We just kept lifting it, and nobody called."" But I call. I call.
Go ahead, Jon.
Democratic Presidential Debate 
Q. And I want to ask you about the debate. You clearly saw at least some of the Democratic debate.
The President. Yes. Q. I'm sure you saw the exchange between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris——
The President. I did.
Q. ——on the issue of Federal busing—federally mandated busing. Biden thought that was a bad policy. He tried to stop it. Kamala Harris said it was an important part of desegregation, including in her own experience.
Where do you stand on that issue of federally mandated busing?
The President. Well, first of all, before I get into that, I thought that she was given too much credit. He didn't do well, certainly, and maybe the facts weren't necessarily on his side. I think she was given too much credit for what she did. It wasn't that outstanding. And I think probably he was hit harder than he should've been hit, Biden. I thought he was hit actually harder.
And as far as that, I will tell you in about 4 weeks, because we're coming out with certain policy that's going to be very interesting and very surprising, I think, to a lot of people.
Jennifer [Jennifer Jacobs, Bloomberg News], do you have a question?
2020 Presidential Election/Democratic Presidential Debate 
Q. But do you think Kamala Harris would be a tough opponent for you, given what you saw in that debate?
The President. You never know who's going to be tough. You never know. One that you think is going to be tough turns out to be not much. And sometimes, you think one—and I've seen it. Because, look, I had 17—we had, actually, a total of 18. A lot of people think 17. Governor of Virginia, remember? Add the Governor of Virginia. Wasn't there long—previous Governor.
But of the 18, you know, many were—all their lives, they wanted to be politicians. I never thought about being a politician until about 2 days before I decided to run. A little before that, but not too much before.
And they—you know, you looked at some of them, they're very talented. You look at their résumés, it's, like, great. And sometimes, the ones that I thought would be the toughest were not the toughest at all. I mean, I could write a book. I should write a book.
But some of the people that I did in the Republican—because we had sort of a similar thing. We had 18 instead of—I guess they have 24 or 25. But some of the ones that I thought would be absolutely—absolutely, without question, the toughest, turned out—I didn't think they were tough at all. Others that a lot of people said weren't tough, they were tougher.
I think she was given far too much credit for what she did. That was so out of the can, what she said. That thing was right out of a box. And I thought that he didn't respond great. I wouldn't say it was—this was not Winston Churchill we're dealing with, okay? But, I don't think, nearly as bad as they portended it to be.
Jennifer, go ahead.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Thank you.
Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. 
Q. Could I clarify your negotiations and what you agreed to with China on Huawei?
The President. Sure.
Q. Did you agree that Huawei can sell to the U.S. or that U.S. companies can sell to Huawei? The President. U.S. companies can sell their equipment to Huawei. We're talking about equipment where there is no great national emergency problem with it. But the U.S. companies can sell their equipment. So we have a lot of the great companies in Silicon Valley and based in different parts of the country that make extremely complex equipment. We're letting them sell to Huawei.
Turkey/Turkey's Purchase of Russian S-400 Antiaircraft System 
Q. And then, on Turkey, sir, will Turkey face sanctions if it goes ahead with the S-400 purchases?
The President. Okay, so Turkey is an interesting case—because there's another one, Jim, that I get along with very well, and he's a tough cookie, okay? Right? President Erdogan. He's tough, but I get along with him. And maybe that's a bad thing, but I think it's a really good thing. Because, frankly, he wanted to wipe out—he has a big problem with the Kurds, as everyone knows. And he had a 65,000-man army at the border, and he was going to wipe out the Kurds, who helped us with ISIS. We took out the caliphate. We have a hundred percent of the caliphate.
And I called him and I asked him not to do it. They are, I guess, natural enemies of his or Turkey's. And he hasn't done it. He had—they were lined up to go out and wipe out the people that we just defeated the ISIS caliphate with, and I said, ""You can't do that."" You can't do it. And he didn't do it.
So I have a relationship. But let me tell you—so he goes out during the Obama administration; he wants to buy our Patriot missile. Right? They wouldn't sell it to him. He wants to buy—even though he's a member of NATO, and, in theory, he could be an ally if he respected the President. He—and he's got a big army, and he's—you know, they're fighters. Turkey is—big fighters. And we're working on Idlib Province together, because he doesn't want to see 3 million people killed, and neither do I—in Syria. But—and I mentioned that. That was another thing I mentioned, folks, to President Putin. I said, ""Please, take it easy with Idlib."" Because, you know, they've been encircling that.
I think if I didn't put out a statement 6 months ago, that would've been catastrophic. But they have 30,000 terrorists in Idlib Province. You have 3 million people. And you know, getting terrorists is okay, but you don't want to kill 3 million people or a million people to get the terrorists.
So anyway—so we get along great. But what happened with Turkey—and I will tell you when it's fair and when it's not fair. He wanted to buy the Patriot missile. President Obama's group said no. He kept wanting to buy it. They kept saying no, no, no. Couldn't buy it. Now, he needed it for defense. He needed it. So he then went to Russia, and he bought the S-400. Made a deal to buy it, because he couldn't get it. They wouldn't allow him to buy it. They wouldn't allow it. This administration, meaning this administration previous to mine, would not let him buy it.
So he goes out, he goes to Russia, and he makes a deal for the S-400. And let's assume it's not nearly as good, but he made a deal. He paid them money, a lot of money. Put up a lot of money. And he bought it. As soon as he bought it, people went back to him, from our country, and they said, ""Listen, we don't want you to use that system,"" because it's not the NATO system, et cetera, et cetera—you know all the reasons: ""We don't want you to use that system. Do us a favor, we'll sell you the Patriot."" He said, ""It's too late. I already bought it."" There was nothing he could do; he already bought it.
In the meantime, he bought over a hundred F-35s, the greatest fighter jet in the world. It's stealth. You can't see it. It's real hard to beat something when you can't see it. But he bought over a hundred. I think he bought 116. But he bought over a hundred. A lot. And he has options for more. And now he wants delivery. He's paid a tremendous amount of money, up front to Lockheed, our company, our jobs, everything. And now they're saying he's using the S-400 system, which is incompatible with our system, and if you use the S-400 system, Russia and other people can gain access into the genius of the F-35.
But honestly, I'm all for our country, but he got treated very unfairly. He was told you can't buy it, you can't buy it. You know, it's the old secret when you can't have something, all of a sudden, he ends up going and getting something else, and then they were—they said—first they said: ""We'll sell it to you. You can have it in 4 years."" Then, they said, ""We'll get it to you immediately."" But he said: ""I can't do it. I bought. I've spent a fortune on buying another system""—similar system—from Russia. The problem is, he already bought the planes. And the planes aren't compatible from our standpoint. Not from the standpoint of compatibility, but from our standpoint, national security wise.
So it's a mess. It's a mess. And honestly, it's not really Erdogan's fault. So now we have breaking news.
Q. So that means——
The President. ""Donald Trump loves Turkey. He loves Turkey. Donald Trump is on the side of Turkey instead of the United""——
Q. Doesn't sound like you're——
The President. No, I'm not.
Turkey-U.S. Relations 
Q. You don't seem like you want to go ahead with the sanctions?
The President. I love our country, but I have to tell you, President Erdogan, who has done—he gave me our pastor back, Pastor Brunson. Nobody else could get him back. Remember? They couldn't get him back. President Obama, he was in jail for 35 years. He was going to be in jail forever. Pastor Brunson, he was an innocent man.
I called him. And after a very short period of time, Pastor Brunson was standing in the Oval Office, with me. And he was back. So you know, he's been—from my standpoint—and he's a tough guy. Okay? When you talk about tough. He's tough. But I get along with him.
I think he was unfairly treated, where you were told you can't have it, and then after he bought another system, we were said—we said: ""We'll sell it to you. We'll give it to you right away."" But he couldn't use it then. But by that time, he had already bought the plane.
So it's a complicated deal. We're working on it. We'll see what we can do.
Q. Can I ask you one last quick thing on China?
The President. Yes, go. Please.
Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. 
Q. So there was a negotiation on Huawei, welcoming students, holding off on tariffs. So it sounds like China has agreed to buy more ag, but is this a lopsided agreement or what more did China agree to?
The President. No, we agreed—on China, this is actually a good question. I did agree to allow our companies—you know, it's jobs—I like our companies selling things to other people. So I allowed that to happen. Very complex things. Not easy. This is not things that are easy to make. Very few companies are able to do it. But a tremendous amount of money. Our companies were very upset. You know, these companies are great companies. You know all of them. But they weren't exactly happy with it. But we're allowing that because that was a national security; we're allowing them to sell.
But we agreed to leave that till the end. Huawei is a complicated situation. We agreed to leave that—we're leaving Huawei toward the end. We're going to see. We'll see where we go with the trade agreement.
Yes, please.
School Busing 
Q. Thank you. I have a question about the border, but I just wanted to follow up quickly on the question about busing. Do you see it as a viable way of integrating schools? Does that relate to the policy that you're going to unveil?
The President. Well, it has been something that they've done for a long period of time. I mean, you know, there aren't that many ways you're going to get people to schools. So this is something that's been done. In some cases, it's been done with a hammer instead of velvet glove. And you know, that's part of it.
But this has been certainly a thing that's been used over the—I think if Vice President Biden had answered the question somewhat differently, it would've been a lot—it would've been a different result. Because they really did hit him hard on that one. So—but it is certainly a primary method of getting people to schools.
Q. And is it—does it relate to the policy that you're going to unveil that you just floated?
The President. It relates to everything we're doing. And you'll be hearing about it in—over the next couple of months.
U.S. Asylum Policy/Border Security 
Q. Over the next couple of months? Okay. And I want to ask you about the border. It seems like there is officially a week to go until the ICE raids begin under that deadline that you imposed.
The President. Yes.
Q. Given that you have a July 4 recess, is it realistic to think that you're going to get a deal to actually reform the asylum laws?
The President. No, because we could do it in—we could do it—you know, I say to people—I used to say 45 minutes; I say 15. But we could do it quickly. We could do it in a day. We could do it in an hour. We could reform asylum very quickly. We could get rid of the loopholes very quickly. These are horrible loopholes.
And the reason that Mexico is so good—because they do have very, very tough immigration. They don't have the kind of things and the kind of stupidity that we have. I mean, where somebody touches one foot on our sand and we now have to bring them into a court. We then have to register them. We then have to catch and release them. And they go, and they live in our country. Then they're supposed to come back in 3 years for a court case, and about 2 percent come back, very—as you know. I mean, you know it just as well as anybody, I really think. Maybe better than most.
But the fact is, they come back—but nobody comes back. Two percent come back. It's a horrible system. Now, what we're doing is, they come in illegally, and we're bringing them out legally. But at the request of some, you know, very good Democrats, they asked me if I could hold it. And I did for a couple of weeks. And we have a week left. But other than the fact that we did get, in a very bipartisan way, we got—and I appreciate Speaker Pelosi because she really worked with us. It was humanitarian money.
I mean, they didn't have any money.
Q. Is——
The President. And we're running—don't forget, nobody has ever had this problem before. We're running hospitals; we're running so many different things for the kids. And the kids are brought up because, under the laws, the kids are used—legally used—to get other people to come in.
If you have a child, it's much easier to come into our country. It's easy anyway. But if you have a child, it's much easier. So we have these kids who have been absolutely abused. Horribly abused. And we could stop that with a minor change in the law. It's a terrible thing that they're not doing it.
So here's what's happening. So I said, ""All right, let's see if you can give that to us."" Now, in the meantime, we did—we just got it approved last night, so we have the $4½ billion in humanitarian aid. Right? And that's good. So we have that.
But we can have that number go way down if we stop people from coming up. For instance, if we had walls up and if we had it hard, the father and the beautiful daughter who drowned—and you know, the Rio Grande is a very tough—you know, that has moments where it can be very calm, and then all of a sudden, it becomes totally violent, and people get swept away.
But if they thought it was hard to get in, they wouldn't be coming up. They wouldn't be coming up. And so many lives would be saved.
So, essentially, if they would change the laws—and I said, ""It would take us an hour, but let's give you 2 weeks."" At the end of the second week, we'll be removing people—legally removing. In other words——
Border Security 
Q. So you're still planning for that deadline? That deadline is still in place, which is now a week from now?
The President. Oh, yes. Unless we do something pretty miraculous. But the Democrats, it seems to me, they want to have open borders. And for the life of me, I cannot figure that out. It's one thing, because I want people to come into our country. We need them, because we have all these companies coming in. You know, we have Foxconn in Wisconsin. We have so many companies coming in. Auto companies. Just today I was with President Abe; he told me another auto company is going to build a big plant. They need people. So I'm all for that.
The only problem is that they have to come in through a process. They have to come in legally. It's also very unfair. You have millions of people on line for years trying to get into a country. They take tests. They study. They know a lot about our country. They read. They do—they have to go through a very complicated process. And these people have worked hard. They've been on line for 7, 8, 9 years, and then somebody walks in, and they're, you know, ""Welcome to the United States."" It's really—honestly, it's very unfair.
But yes, we will be removing large numbers of people. People have to understand: Yes, the laws are— Q. In a week?
The President. Yes. Starting in a week, after—you know, sometime after July 4.
Border Security 
Q. So the deal that was just passed does nothing to make you want to step back from that raid?
The President. Well, that's different. That's humanitarian—no, that's a different—that's humanitarian. We needed that just to take care—because we're running now hospitals. I mean, the Border Patrol—these are incredible people—they're doing what they—you know, nobody ever thought they were going to be doing this.
And people are coming up—the reason people are coming up is because we're doing so well as a country. In past years, we weren't doing well. In past years, Mexico was doing better. You know, they took 32 percent of our car business. They were doing better than we were doing in the past. Now we're the hot country in the world, and people are coming up because they want a piece of that action.
And the other reason children are coming up is because we had a separation policy. Okay? Under President Obama, we had separation. President Obama built those cells. They were in 2014. They were built. They all said, ""Oh, look how horrible."" Then, it turned out that it was built by President Obama. And I'm not blaming anybody. I'm not blaming him.
I just say this: They had a separation policy. Right? I ended it. But when I ended it, I put out a statement: I think it's going to bring more children up because you're ending it. You're saying now the child can stay with the parent. So I said, ending it is nice in one way, but in terms of what we're doing, it makes it even tougher.
But the really bad thing is the cartels—and I really think that Mexico—because, you know, they did 6,000; now they're doing 16,000 on our border—I think that Mexico is looking to swamp the cartels. And those kind of numbers will do it. It would be a great thing. What Mexico is doing for us is great.
By the way, without the tariffs, they wouldn't have done it, folks. We've been after—we've been after them for many years to do it.
But they have really, so far—it's only a week—the numbers are way down. And, so far, a lot of good things have happened.
Yes, sir. Please. Yes, please. In the second row.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Two questions about Iran.
The President. Would you like me to leave now or? Here's the thing: I can stay—we can do this for a long time. My only problem is this: I don't need stories, ""He stayed up there too long."" If I stay up there quickly, they say, ""Why did he not give us more time?"" If I stay up for 2 hours, they'll say, ""He stayed up too long.""
I mean, if you promise you're not going to say—I say because everybody has got a hand up, and if you want, I'll go on. Should I go on, or should I not go on? What you do you think?
Q. Go on.
Q. At least one more.
The President. Okay, and you're not going to say, ""He went on too long?""
Q. At least one more. The President. Because we have time. You know, I have a flight that actually leaves pretty much when I want it to. [Laughter] Okay, let's go.
Iran/U.S. Military 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Two questions about Iran. A week ago, you called off a strike because you were concerned it would kill Iranians.
The President. Disproportionately, absolutely.
Q. Disproportionately. Did the military leaders provide you with any alternative? You know, some derelict oil rig that could have been hit to——
The President. No, no, no——
Q. ——to make a point?
The President. Oh, I had many—oh, yes, I have—I'll bet I have 50 alternatives. I have many alternatives. Yes. I mean, you don't know what the sites were. You said ""oil rig."" You don't know what the sites were. But I had many alternatives. No, no, military leaders did a great job.
When we chose and designated certain areas that we were thinking about, I said, ""How many people are going to die?"" I mean, I'm talking about on the other side. That means a lot to me too, okay? ""How many people are going to die?"" They said, ""Probably about 150."" You don't know, could be much worse than that. Could be less too, I guess, but it could be much more than that, because this is heavy stuff going in.
And we would have been a hundred percent—we have the greatest military in the world. I deal with them all the time. These people are incredible people. Lethal. And hopefully, we don't have to use it much.
I mean, we've spent—if you look at the numbers—$716 billion this year. We had planes that were so old that we didn't—now we have brandnew F-35s. We have brandnew Super Hornets and F-18s and—I mean, the equipment we have is incredible.
The Army now has beautiful new things. Everything is—we have a military that's really great. Hopefully, we don't have to use it very much.
But no, they came in, they said this, and I asked them a question. And they came back a short time later and they said, ""About 150 people."" I said: ""That's really disproportionate. I don't like it.""
Iran 
Q. My second question is that, here at the G-20 summit, what can you tell us: Has the ball been moved in any particular direction towards easing the tensions with Iran in some of the meetings that you've had?
The President. Well, I have had a lot of countries come up to me. France has come up. If you look at President Macron—good guy—he came up to me. He said, ""You know, I do a lot of business""—meaning, France does a lot of business with Iran.
I would love to go see them. It's all right. Anybody can see them. I don't mind talking. I think talking is great. I'm not going to say: ""Oh, don't talk to them. Don't talk to them.""
I do think John Kerry should not have been talking to them. I think that's delaying this process a lot. I think he violated the Logan Act, actually. But I think John Kerry, speaking to Iran a lot, maybe saying things like: ""Gee, you know, if you wait another 15 months, maybe Trump will lose the election, and then you can deal with a person that's a lot easier than Trump. You'll deal with a stiff that will give you everything you want."" And that makes it a little tougher for me to make a deal, but that's okay.
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Yes, please. Go.
U.S. Census 
Q. Mr. President, during the week, you tweeted out your displeasure with the Supreme Court's decision on census, and you suggested you may seek to delay the census.
The President. Yes, I think it's very unfortunate.
Q. Are you, in fact, going to try to delay the census?
The President. Well, we're looking at that legally, because they're asking us to do a census. And you know, the census—it was shocking to me. I figured it would be, you know, not expensive to do a census. It's billions of dollars. You know that, right? Billions. Billions.
They go knock on doors of every house in the country, and they get everything. They're not allowed to ask whether or not somebody is a citizen of the United States? How horrible and ridiculous is that?
So we are looking at that. Yes. Sure.
Q. Do you know if you have the legal authority to do that?
The President. Because it wasn't a real decision that, ""Boom, this is the way it is."" It was like, ""Now."" Right? ""Now.""
It depends on what happens, I guess. It was a very strange decision. It was a very, very sad decision. Not in terms of voting. Not in terms of—just a very sad, because it was so convoluted. It was—to get to that decision, had to be very, very hard.
Q. Well, the judges—the Justices said that your guys were playing politics when deciding not to count noncitizens.
The President. Hey, who's really playing politics, okay? Check it out. You tell me who's playing politics.
Yes, go ahead. Please.
Q. Thanks, Mr. President. I think I heard you mention earlier——
The President. You're?
Potential Russian Interference in 2020 Presidential Election 
Q. Geoff Earle with Daily Mail. It's been a while.
I think I heard you mention that with Vladimir Putin you had said you spoke about election interference privately as well. Did you give—did you speak to him in a sterner tone? Did you tell him there——
The President. No. I just——
Q. ——would be serious consequences?
The President. We talked about it. Hey, we talked about it. You know we've talked about it before. You know he denies it totally, by the way. Just to—I mean, how many times can you get somebody to deny something? But he has, in the past, denied it. He's denied it also publicly.
But we talked about it. We talked about a lot of other things. I tell you, we talked about something that I think is very important, and that's putting a cap on what he's buying and we're buying, from a nuclear standpoint—and other—arms control. We talked a lot about arms control. And I think he'd like to see arms control, and so would we. I think it makes a lot of sense.
Q. What was the context in which you——
The President. Yes, go ahead.
Investigation Into Russia's Interference in 2016 Presidential Election 
Q. Did you raise what was in the Mueller report? Did you, sort of, articulate to him——
The President. Oh, the Mueller report was a very——
Q. ——that you thought that things happened?
The President. ——good report. I mean, it was a good report.
I had 18 people that hated me. I had Mueller who was totally conflicted and, obviously, didn't like me. We had—he was totally conflicted. And yet no obstruction, no collusion. And you know, that was good report.
Yes, please.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. And you know, the Democrats want a do-over or five. They want to get it right. They're working to get it right. They want a do-over or five.
Yes, please.
Arab-Israeli Peace Process 
Q. Edward Szall with TruNews. President Trump, your administration just unveiled the economic portion of the ""deal of the century."" My question to you is: Why were no Palestinians members of the White House peace plan committee?
The President. Well, they are a very important part of it, but they don't really have to be. We're just getting started.
We have—and, as you know, we have a very good—David Friedman, a great gentleman. One of the most successful lawyers in New York, who loves Israel—David Friedman. Jason Greenblatt, who worked for me and my company, great, great lawyer. Great talent. Jared Kushner. And with me being President, if you don't get that deal done it, will never happen. We'll have to see what happens.
But I think the Palestinians basically—I'm not sure—I know they want to make a deal, but they want to be a little bit cute, and that's okay. I fully understand where they're coming from.
As you know, I've ended the money to—that was—we were paying them $550 million a year, and I ended that money because a year ago, I heard they were saying nasty things. I said: ""Wait a minute. We're trying to make a deal. We're trying to help them and they're saying these nasty things? We're not going to pay.""
Now, if a deal is made, we would go back on a humanitarian basis. Not so different from the border. Because you see the problems and what's going on. It's terrible. But I think we have a very good chance of making a deal, and a lot of people think that's probably the toughest deal of all. And it may very well be the toughest deal of all. A lot of people think it can't be made. I mean, over the years, a lot of people would say, ""That's a deal that can't be made no matter what.""
But you know, hey, I like to—we're going to try. But I really believe that—I went to other negotiators from past years. For many, many years they've been trying to make this deal. And I said, ""Did you ever take the money away?"" Because they were always very hostile. And they said: ""No, we wouldn't do that. That's inappropriate."" ""Why is it inappropriate? I mean, they're saying bad things. Why is it inappropriate?""
And wha","t I've done is said, ""Look, as long—if you're not negotiating and if you don't want to make peace, we're not going to pay you."" So let's see what happens.
I think they want to make a deal, and I've had a very good relationship with some of their leaders. And obviously I've had a good relationship with Israel.
Now, the transaction was thrown up in the air a little bit because of what happened with Bibi Netanyahu's election. They thought he won, and then, all of a sudden, they couldn't put together the coalition. And now they're back to campaigning again. So that was something that came up that—who would have expected that. Maybe something will happen faster, but you know, that's going to be going on for about 3 months.
There's a good chance we could—there's a chance. I don't want to even say ""good chance"" on that one because people say it's the hardest deal. I've heard—when I was young, I'd say, ""What do you think of this?"" They'd say, ""Oh, that's tougher than Israel and the Palestinians making a deal."" They used to use that as, like, the metaphor. They used to use that as the excuse for a deal that was very tough to make. So it's probably about the toughest deal to make.
I actually think that there's a good chance.
Yes, sir. Please, go ahead. Yes. White shirt. No, the gentleman behind you. Yes. Okay, go ahead.
Q. Can I——
The President. We'll get to you.
Q. Thank you.
The President. Go ahead. That's the man I'm looking at.
Q. Demetri Sevastopulo, Financial Times. Can I just ask, first, one clarification?
The President. Sure.
Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. 
Q. Are you saying you're taking Huawei off the Commerce Department entity list?
The President. No, not at all. No, no. We're going to be talking about Huawei, but we are going to be supplying equipment from our companies. Our companies make billions and billions of dollars' worth of equipment. But we are not discussing Huawei with President Xi yet. I want to see—before we start getting into that, I want to see where we end up. We have to——
Q. But are you——
The President. We have a national security problem, which to me is paramount. Very important.
Q. But are you taking Huawei off the Commerce Department entity list? The President. We're talking about that. We have a meeting on that tomorrow or Tuesday.
China-U.S. Trade/ZTE Corporation 
Q. Okay. And my question is, you talk a lot about the economic and the trade practices of China, and you're very critical. You don't talk so much about the national security concerns about China.
The President. Well, that's not——
Q. What do you worry about China in terms of——
The President. It goes without—I think that goes without saying. I mean, look what I've done. Look what—who's done what I've done? I took ZTE off, if you remember. I was the one; I did that. That was a personal deal. And then, President Xi called me. And he asked me for a personal favor, which I considered to be very important. He's a leader of a major country. And it was very important to him, having to do with where the employees are located and his relationship to that area. And it was 85,000 employees. And they were almost out of business. And he agreed to pay a $1.2 billion penalty and some other things, including a board change and including some management changes, et cetera. The ZTE, which is a—you know, much smaller than Huawei, but it's very big. And they paid us a billion-two. $1.2 billion.
I mean, part of the problem is then the Democrats go out and say—if I got $200 trillion, they'd say: ""This was terrible. What a terrible deal."" Because that's the way politics is. It's, sort of, sad.
But you know, we got $1.2 billion. And we closed it; we opened it. And we had certain changes made, as you know. They made changes to the board. They changed the board. They made management changes. And they paid a lot of money. And they also have to buy American product. Buying American product is very important to me. It's a big thing.
Q. Can I just ask you to clarify——
The President. Yes. Go ahead, blue. Blue shirt.
Q. Stefan Niemann with ARD——
The President. Are we going to continue onward?
Q. Yes.
The President. Yes?
Q. Yes.
The President. Does anybody say ""no""? Huh?
Q. No.
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany 
Q. Thank you. Stefan Niemann with ARD German Television. One question——
The President. We just left Angela.
Q. I know. Thank you.
The President. She's another friend of mine. People don't think so.
Q. And you called her a fantastic woman. Yes.
The President. We have a great relationship. I hope you know that. Q. Since we will not forget that.
The President. We spent a lot of time together too.
Climate Change 
Q. You praised this G-20 summit as extremely successful, yet it was a ""G-19 against one"" summit if we look at climate change. Why is it that you still think ignoring the dangers of climate change is in the interest of the American people?
The President. I don't ignore it. So we have the best numbers that we've ever had recently. And I'm not looking to put our companies out of business. I'm not looking to create a standard that is so high that we're going to lose 20, 25 percent of our production. I'm not willing to do that. We have the cleanest water we've ever had. We have the cleanest air. You saw the reports come out recently. We have the cleanest air we've ever had. But I'm not willing to sacrifice the tremendous power of what we've built up over a long period of time and what I've enhanced and revived. I'm not—I'm just not willing to do that.
And they understand where I stand. And you know, I'm not necessarily sure I agree. I can tell you, I'm not sure that I agree with certain countries, what they're doing. Because I think they're losing a lot of the power of what they can do with factories and with—and I'm not talking about political power, although that comes with it—I'm talking about the powering of a plant. It doesn't always work with a windmill. When the wind goes off, the plant isn't working. It doesn't always work with solar, because solar is just not strong enough.
And a lot of them want to go to wind, which has caused a lot of problems. And you know, the problem with wind is, in the United States, we're subsidizing these wind towers all over the place, because wind doesn't work—for the most part, doesn't work without subsidy. And I don't want to be subsidizing things that don't have to be subsidized.
The United States is paying tremendous amounts of money on subsidies for wind. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't want to do that.
We'll take a few more. Go ahead. Go ahead.
Iran 
Q. Thank you, sir. Two questions on Iran, please.
The President. One.
Q. One question on Iran. [Laughter] Okay. Well, Iran——
The President. Pick the better one, please.
Q. Will do, sir. Iran says that it will be on the verge of violating the threshold for uranium enrichment in the JCPOA as soon as, potentially, next week. What will be your response when that happens?
The President. You'll see.
Q. Okay. Can I have a follow-up, sir?
The President. That's all I can do. That's all I can do. No. But that's all I can do.
Q. Just——
The President. I can only say, ""You'll see."" We cannot let Iran have a nuclear weapon. Just can't do it.
Please. Venezuela 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Celia Mendoza from VOA Latin America. You met yesterday with President Putin, and in the readout, it says that you touched the subject of Venezuela.
The President. Yes.
Q. But can you expand a little bit of what was said during the meeting about Venezuela? And also——
The President. Well, first of all, we're following Venezuela very closely. It's a catastrophe. It's what socialism can do. I use it all the time. I mean, it's what socialism can do. It was one of the richest countries 20 years ago. It's got among the largest oil reserves in the world. And they don't have food. They don't have water. It's really, actually, incredible. I discussed it with—I've discussed it with almost every leader this weekend. We discuss Venezuela, because we don't ever want that to happen to us or their countries.
Okay, go ahead.
Q. You mentioned that change of regime takes time, and then in Venezuela, it has proven——
The President. Oh, sure, it takes time.
Q. But do you think that it's a possibility——
The President. The problem is, so many people leaving Venezuela; it's, like, going to be a ghost town. It's a very bad thing that's happening in Venezuela. Nobody has seen anything quite like it, actually—especially from the standpoint that they were so wealthy.
They've gone—I know so many people from Venezuela living in Miami. They're incredible people. They're incredible, incredible—a lot of them live in Doral, Miami. It's—they call it ""Little Venezuela."" I know them so well. These are people that are hard workers, warm. They're just incredible. And to see what's happening to Venezuela is heartbreaking. It's really heartbreaking.
Venezuela 
Q. Mr. President, do you think that it is a time for change the strategy? And do you still believe that Juan Guaidó is the person to lead the country? You have backed him up.
The President. Sure. You have a lot of strategies. I have five different strategies. I could change any moment.
But, in the meantime, we're helping them from the standpoint of aid. We're getting as much aid as we can. I think they're making a big mistake, because they're not making the aid very easy, as you know. You know, they're not making it easy to get to people. But people are starving to death, and their water—they have no water. They have no water. They have oil, but they don't have any water.
No, we have a lot of things in store if we have to do that. We don't want to do anything but—you know, we don't want to get involved to the extent that you may be thinking. But we have a lot of alternatives. We have five different alternatives for Venezuela. And we'll see what happens. It's doing very poorly. And Maduro is doing very poorly, obviously. It's not—it's just not working. Just not working.
Yes, ma'am. Go ahead.
Death of Saudi Journalist Jamal Khashoggi 
Q. Anita Kumar with Politico. I just wanted to—— The President. So from where are you?
Q. Politico. Anita Kumar. Politico. I just wanted to follow up on the questions that were asked—Jim asked about——
The President. Question. Question. Question.
Q. ——question—about the Crown Prince that you met with earlier today. I didn't hear you answer the question: Did you raise the killing of Jamal Khashoggi with him?
The President. I asked, yes.
Q. And what was the response?
The President. I asked him what was happening, and he was telling me that—I think he said 13, but could be more—and I think he said more in the works—that there are large numbers of people being prosecuted. He's very angry about it. He's very unhappy about it.
And I did mention it to him very strongly, and he answered very strongly. But they're prosecuting large numbers of people. That was a bad event.
Okay.
Death of Saudi Journalist Jamal Khashoggi/U.S. Intelligence Community/Iran 
Q. And, sir——
The President. Yes, go ahead, please.
Q. ——can I just follow up? You mentioned—you mentioned that the intelligence community—you mentioned that no one had pointed the finger at him, but actually, the CIA did—the intelligence community.
The President. I cannot comment on intelligence community. I just—I'm not—probably, I guess I'm allowed to do what I want to do in terms of that, right? We can declassify, unlike Hillary Clinton. She decided to just give it out. We can declassify. The truth is that I just don't want to talk about intelligence.
But I will say this: A lot of people are being prosecuted, and they're taking it very seriously over there. And they've done a great job in Saudi Arabia from the standpoint of women and from—a lot of different things are happening in Saudi Arabia.
One of the other things—very important with Saudi Arabia: that not only are they an ally, not only have they spent tremendous amounts of money coming into our country—and they have been a good ally, and they have actually bought tremendous amounts of military equipment that we use and that we're able to use—but they're also very much now changed their ways as to financing terror, which I can't say for a lot of other countries.
If you look at Iran, if you look at other countries in that area, they're financing terror. Now, it's harder for Iran because Iran doesn't have the money they used to have. And they were given $150 billion. They were given $1.8 billion in cash. But Saudi Arabia has come a long way. I'll tell you, in terms of reform, Saudi Arabia really has come a long way.
Yes, please—in the gold. Yes, you. Right.
Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. 
Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I'm—[inaudible]—with China's—[inaudible]—Media Business News Organization in China. Just a little bit of follow-up on Huawei: You say you're going to discuss Huawei's entity listing soon. Is it possible—would you say it's a possibility that Huawei is going to be removed from the list? The President. Is it going to what?
Q. Removed from the entity list. Is it possible?
The President. I don't want to talk about it now. I mean, we're looking at that very carefully. Huawei is very much in play, in terms of our country and in terms of intelligence and the intelligence community. We know a lot about Huawei. But I don't want to mention that right now. I just think it's inappropriate.
I will say that we're not making it—other than what I told you already, we're not making it a big subject. We're going to save that for later. Okay?
China-U.S. Trade 
Q. Okay. And another question on the big picture of U.S.-China relations: What do you think the U.S. and China should see each other? Are we strategic partners? Are we competitors? Are we enemies? What are we?
The President. No. I think we're going to be strategic partners.
Q. Thank you.
The President. I think we can help each other. I think, in the end, we can—if the right deal is structured, we can be great for each other.
If China would open up—you're opening up a tremendous—you know, the largest market in the world. And right now China is not open to the United States, but we're open to China. That should have never really been allowed to happen.
Okay. Yes, please. Dan.
Russia-U.S. Relations 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. On Russia, are you planning to go to Moscow next spring, as President Putin invited you?
The President. Yes.
Q. And do you agree with him that Western-style liberalism, as it's been defined over the postwar period, is now obsolete and no longer relevant to today's world?
The President. Well, I haven't heard him say that. But he did invite me to Russia for the defeat of Nazis—that's a big thing—defeat of Nazis. You know, Russia lost, he said, 25 million people. I had actually heard 50 million people. But he said yesterday that Russia, fighting the Nazis, they lost 25 million people. You would know better than anybody, Peter [Peter Baker, New York Times].
But it was a tremendous—you know, they suffered greatly. And they're having a 75th, you could really say, celebration of the defeat of the Nazis. And he invited me, and I said I would give it very serious consideration. That was a—Russia went through a lot. They lost, I guess, far more than anybody, fighting the Nazis, in terms of people. And he did invite me, and I said we would get back. But we will give that very serious consideration.
Okay? Thank you, Peter.
Russian President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin's Views of Western Liberalism/U.S. Cities/U.S. Economy 
Q. His comments to the Financial Times, right before arriving here, was that Western-style liberalism is obsolete. I know you probably haven't read the interview. Do you think that's true? The President. Well, again, he may feel that way. I mean, he sees what's going on. And I guess, if you look at what's happening in Los Angeles, where it's so sad to look; and what's happening in San Francisco and a couple of other cities which are run by an extraordinary group of liberal people—I don't know what they're thinking. But he does see things that are happening in the United States that would—would probably preclude him from saying how wonderful it is.
At the same time, he congratulated me, as every other—every other leader of every country did for what we've done economically, because we probably have the strongest economy we've ever had. And that's a real positive.
But I'm very embarrassed by what I see in some of our cities, where the politicians are either afraid to do something about it, or they think it's votes, or—I don't know what. Peter, I don't know what they're thinking.
But when you look at Los Angeles, when you look at San Francisco, when you look at some of the other cities—and not a lot, not a lot, but you don't want it to spread. And, at a certain point, I think the Federal Government, maybe, has to get involved. We can't let that continue to happen to our cities.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. I'll see some of you in South Korea, maybe at the DMZ. But this has been an honor. Thank you all very much. Thank you."
"September 20, 2019",The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia,Donald J. Trump,"Donald J. Trump, The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/333873",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-scott-morrison-australia,"President Trump. Well, thank you very much. Please. We had a spectacular morning, and it's an honor being with the Prime Minister and Mrs. Morrison. Thank you very much. Australia is a fantastic country and a brilliant ally. We just spent a lot of time together with our representatives, and they get along very well, and we're doing a lot of deals. And we talked military. We talked trade. We talked about everything you can talk about. And we came to the same conclusion, I think, in every case.
But I just want to say it's an honor having both of you here. Thank you very much. You have a truly great country, and I don't think we've ever had a better relationship than we have right now.
And tonight we're going to have something very special in the Rose Garden. And based on all of that money we spend on all of that weather-predicting equipment, they're saying, ""No chance of rain."" [Laughter] Let's see if that's right. If it is, we'll run right back into this room. [Laughter]
But we're going to have a fantastic evening. And, First Lady, thank you very much. You worked very hard on this. So it's not going to rain. It's going to be a beautiful evening. And great job. Really great job, honey.
Thank you. Please, Scott.
Prime Minister Morrison. Thank you, Mr. President and Mrs. Trump. We thank you also very much for the incredibly warm and generous welcome that Jenny and I and our delegation have had here in Washington, in this great home of the American Presidency and indeed your home.
One of many things that the President and I share in common is a passion for jobs. And the job performance here in the United States, the jobs that are being created in Australia, the jobs that change people's lives—you know, when people get a job, they've got choices. And Australia and the United States, we're committed to creating jobs. And whether it's in trade or it's whether—in looking at the future and where those jobs are going to come from, we want our people to have those economic opportunities.
I commend the President on the great work he's done in creating jobs here in the United States. And we're doing the same thing in Australia. And if you want to keep creating jobs, then this partnership is a big part of that. And that's why we're pleased to come together here. We share objectives in so many areas. We share common values. We share beliefs. We've shared a wonderful century together. And now we're going to have a—another great century together of mateship.
So thank you, Mr. President. And thank you for the opportunity for the discussions we've had today. We are very much looking forward to the state dinner this evening. And, Mrs. Trump, you're doing something special there tonight. We don't know if it's the first ever, but as the President said, ""perhaps the first ever."" And that's just another great innovation, which is part of this wonderful visit. So thank you very much.
President Trump. Well, thank you very much, Scott. It's a great honor.
Go ahead. Please. China-U.S. Trade/U.S. Tariff Structure on Chinese Imports/U.S. Economy/U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement 
Q. Mr. President, you've been negotiating with the Chinese, and there seems to be a possibility, in terms of a China trade deal, that they might actually offer some agricultural purchases. Is that going to be enough for you sir——
President Trump. No.
Q. ——in order to get a deal done? What do you need to see at this point to get that deal past the finish line?
President Trump. We're looking for a complete deal. I'm not looking for a partial deal. China has been starting to buy our agricultural product—if you noticed over the last week—and actually, some very big purchases.
But that's not what I'm looking for; we're looking for the big deal. We've taken it to this level. We're taking in billions and billions of dollars of tariffs. China has devalued their currency, and they're putting out a lot of money into their economy. And they have a very bad economy right now, and I don't want them to have a bad economy. But it's the worst in, they say, 57 years. Two weeks ago, it was the worst in 22 years. Now it's 57 years, and it's only going to get worse. Their supply chain is being broken up very badly.
And companies are leaving because they can't pay the 25—soon to go to 30—percent tariff. And we have 30 percent very shortly on $250 billion. We have another tariff at a slightly smaller number, as you know, on other—on about 300 billion dollars' worth of goods and products.
So they would like to do something. As you know, we're talking a little bit this week, talking a lot next week. And then, top people are going to be speaking the week following. But I'm not looking for a partial deal; I'm looking for a complete deal.
Q. Do you feel you need that deal before the election, sir?
President Trump. No. I don't think I need it before the election. I think people know that we're doing a great job. I've rebuilt the military. We've—Scott and I were talking about that. We spent 1½ trillion dollars. When I came in, our military was depleted. Frankly, we didn't have ammunition, okay? But our military was in very bad shape. We've rebuilt the military. We've got one of the strongest economies.
Mike Pence, actually, got some—who is right here. Our great Vice President. He was talking yesterday and he called me. He says, ""Boy, these numbers—these consumer numbers are incredible."" The retail numbers that came out 2 days ago, that really weren't reported, were really—I mean, just incredible numbers. You know that very well. That's your world. And some other numbers.
We're doing very well. Our economy is very strong. And China is being affected very badly. We're not; we're not being affected. In fact, we're taking in many billions of dollars. And China is eating that. You know, China is eating the tariffs because of the devaluation. Now, that doesn't happen with all countries. China is China, and they know what they're doing as well as anybody.
My relationship with President Xi is a very amazing one, very good one. But we have, right now, a little spat. But I think we're doing very well.
Our country is doing well. You look at so many different things. Look at all of the regulation cutting that allows us to do what we did. Look at what happens 3 days ago, where you have an attack like that and it takes out a big chunk of oil, and the prices go up $4, $5, and now it's heading down rapidly. That tells you—that would have happened years ago, it would have gone up $50. It would've doubled. And this was a blip.
So it's been really amazing what we've been able to do. I think the voters understand that. I don't think it has any impact on the election.
Now, if something happened, I think that would probably be a positive for the election, but that's okay. I do think signing USMCA on a bipartisan basis with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and everybody else—very bipartisan—I think that's very important for our country. And I would certainly be willing to say that's a bipartisan deal.
But I think that's very important for our manufacturers, for our farmers. Even for unions, they want that deal done. And so, hopefully, that's going to be put up to a vote very soon. There will be very little cajoling of the Democrats, because most Democrats want it too.
But the USMCA is ready to be voted on. It's finished. Mexico has taken their final votes. Canada is willing to do that any time we want them too. They're all set to go. And we need that for all of the—we need that for our country. It's a great deal. It's a great deal.
Thank you.
China-U.S. Trade 
Q. And for the Prime Minister: Sir, your economy is to some degree caught in the cross-currents between the United States and China. What did you say to the President about what your ideal outcome is here for a China trade agreement between the United States and China?
Prime Minister Morrison. Well, thank you. Look, obviously, we're keen to see the United States and China be able to come to an agreement. But what is always necessary is that deals have got to be fair. Deals have got to be good deals. Deals have got to be sustainable deals.
And I think one of things we've seen: Australia has benefited greatly from the economic growth of China. We have a comprehensive strategic partnership with China and a free trade agreement with China. And they have grown, and they have become, you know, a substantive economy in the world. And once you sort of get into that level, then you need to be able to be playing to the same rules as those other developed nations.
And I think this is, you know, the new generation of deals I think we'll see China do, which the President has been working on, and he's been working on it for some time. And we wish him well in that process.
There are some real serious issues that have to be addressed in that deal. Things like intellectual property. That's a—that's a big issue, and it needs to be addressed. So we look forward to them achieving it and that providing, I think, the broader certainty and stability to the global economy, which all nations will benefit from.
President Trump. And we could do, Scott, a very big deal with China, and it could go very quickly, as you know. But it wouldn't be the appropriate deal. We have to do it right. And that's a very complicated deal, with intellectual property protection. We have to do that and other things. I could leave lots out and have a deal very quickly, but we want to do it right.
Please.
Prime Minister Morrison. Yes, sure. Andrew [Andrew Probyn, Australian Broadcast Corporation].
President Trump. I assume Andrew is a nice person? [Laughter] That's why you chose him? Australian Economy/China-U.S. Trade/Australia-U.S. Trade/Australia's Extractive Industries 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President, the best. [Laughter] Thank you very much for hosting us. Also on China and tariffs: What do you say to Australian businesses and to Australian people who say that your trade war with President Xi threatens their prosperity?
And to the Prime Minister, a linked question: Do you think that Australians are going to be collateral damage in President Trump's tariff war with China?
President Trump. Well, first of all, you know, I look at numbers. I love numbers. And the numbers of Australia are doing incredibly well. You're doing unbelievably well.
When we have a deal with China—or not—but when we have a deal with China—because they want to make it perhaps more than I want to make it. Because I actually love all the billions of dollars that's pouring into our Treasury. Billions and billions of dollars. We've never seen that before from China. It's always been the other way.
But when—and I'm taking care of our farmers out of that. We're helping our farmers. Our farmers were targeted, and they were targeted for $16 billion. And I made that up to them. We paid them the $16 billion and had tens of billions of dollars left over.
So I will say, though, that Australia is doing very well. If we do end up doing a deal, Australia will do even better. And we were discussing that. But Australia will be one of the big beneficiaries of a deal.
And, in the meantime, as you know, I did tariff relief, with respect to a certain product in particular coming out of Australia. And that's something that we wouldn't do for anybody else. This has been a truly great ally, and we work very well together.
But you—your numbers are absolutely fantastic. Your economy is strong like ours. And I think we're two real examples of two countries doing extremely well. Some countries aren't doing so well.
Prime Minister Morrison. That's true.
President Trump. Europe is not doing well. Asia is not doing—large parts of Asia are not doing well. China is not doing well.
Please.
Prime Minister Morrison. Thanks. Mr. President, Australia is in its 29th year of consecutive economic growth, which is an extraordinary national achievement. And we will continue to grow as our most recent national accounts demonstrated.
Australia is also very used to dealing with a complex and changing world. And that's why we've diversified our trade base and have been doing that for many years. I mean, 6 years ago, when our government came to office, 27 percent of our trade was covered by agreements around the world. That figure is now 70 percent, and we're going to take that to 90 percent. And that's important. And that's opening up opportunities.
So there are ebbs and flows that go in the global economy, and Australia has built up a resilience through the broad-based nature in which we're taking our economy to the world. I mean, Australia has never got rich selling things to itself. And we've always had an outward looking perspective when it comes to engaging our economic opportunities.
And a big part of what we've been discussing here is some new opportunities, whether it's in the rare earth metals, the critical minerals, the frontier technologies, space. You know, this is where jobs are going to be in the future, as well. And so we will deal with those ebbs and flows as they come.
But the President is right: The arrangement they will come to—and I'm confident they will—with China will be one that will set, you know, a new bar in terms of how China's economy then deals with a lot of these complicated issues in the future with developed economies like Australia. So we look on with interest. And I think, ultimately, when we arrive at that point, it's going to put global trade on a stronger footing.
President Trump. And Australia has really been so focused on the economy. They do minerals. They have incredible wealth in minerals and coal and other things.
And they are really at the leading edge of coal technology. It's clean coal. We call it ""clean coal,"" but it's also great for the workers. And things that would happen to—because it was very dangerous years ago and very bad for a lot of people. And you've rectified that 100 percent. It's incredible. I looked at your statistics the other day, and coal miners are very, very safe in Australia.
Prime Minister Morrison. True.
President Trump. It's incredible what you've done. In fact, we're looking at what you've done. [Laughter] But so——
Prime Minister Morrison. We can do a deal on that.
President Trump. So I want to—I want to—we'll do a deal. We'll make a deal.
Yes. Go ahead. Please.
Additional U.S. Sanctions on Iran/U.S. Military Readiness/National Security Adviser Robert C. O'Brien/2017 Release of Otto F. Warmbier From Captivity in North Korea/U.S. Hostage Release Negotiations 
Q. Thank you. In the midst of these escalating tensions with Iran, you've now named a new National Security Adviser, Robert O'Brien.
President Trump. Yes.
Q. What is he recommending to you in terms of dealing with the latest strikes on Saudi Arabia and the response?
And then, secondly, you announced new sanctions on Iran. Secretary Mnuchin said that this affects the last available funds for that regime. Have we now exhausted sanctions in regards to Iran?
President Trump. Well, these are the strongest sanctions ever put on a country. We are at a level of sanction that is far greater than ever before with respect to Iran. Today we did Central Bank, as you know. And we'll see. We'll see.
They're having a lot of problems, not only with us; they're having problems within their own country. And I think they have a lot of self-made problems.
We are, by far, the strongest military in the world. Going into Iran would be a very easy decision. As I said before, it'd be very easy. The easiest thing. Most people thought I would go in within 2 seconds, but plenty of time. Plenty of time.
In the meantime, they have a lot of problems within Iran. Iran could be a great country, could be a rich country. But they are choosing to go a different way. There'll be a point at which they'll be very sorry for that choice. But I think I'm showing great restraint. A lot of people respect it; some people don't. Some people say, ""Oh, you should go in immediately."" And other people are so thrilled at what I'm doing. And I don't do it for anybody; I do it for what's good for the United States, what's good for our allies. And it's working out really, very well.
As far as Robert is concerned, he's—Robert, maybe you could stand up? Robert O'Brien is done a fantastic job for us with hostage negotiations. I think we can say that there has never been anybody that has done better than you and I as a combination. We've brought many people home, and we brought them home quickly. Speed is a very important thing, I find, with hostages. It's really something.
I had dinner the other night with the Warmbier family, an incredible family—the whole family and some of Otto's friends, in addition to the family. We had 25 people over on Saturday night. And we did that dinner in Otto—really, in Otto's honor. And it was a beautiful thing. It was a beautiful thing.
The First Lady and I, it was very—you know, it was very touching and really very beautiful. We talked about Otto. And I will tell you that people should have moved faster. And Robert and I were talking about that. Should have moved faster. He was there for a long time.
You've got to move fast. With hostages, you have to move fast. All of a sudden, it gets very hard for the other side to do anything. And sometimes, it's just too late. In the case of Otto, it was very late. We got him home, but he was in horrible, horrible condition. What happened to him was actually incredible and just horrible.
But you have to move fast. Robert and I have been really successful. And the reason I know him so well—I actually work hard on hostages, I think he would say. I think most Presidents wouldn't do that, but I do. These are great—I guess, in almost all cases—American lives. And we help other people, also. We've also helped other countries with their hostage situation, where we have some strength that they don't.
But these are great people. And we get them home. We got them home from North Korea, as you know. And we got them home from a lot of different locations. Egypt—we got them home. We got them home from many different locations. Turkey. President Erdogan was very good. And we got a hostage home, who—our great pastor, who everyone in this room knows and loves.
But we've had tremendous success. And what's surprised me, I didn't know too many people knew Robert. And when it came time to pick somebody for the position—it's a very critical time—I had so many people—I shouldn't say this in front of Robert, he'll be embarrassed, but I had so many people that called me, and they recommended Robert O'Brien. So I think he's going to do a great job.
And he was here—I can tell you this—he started about 12 minutes after he was chosen. He sat in with us. And he's very much involved now on what we're doing.
Iran/U.S. Military Readiness/U.S. Nuclear Arsenal/Australia-U.S. Trade/Australian Defense Spending 
Q. One quick follow-up on that, in regards to Iran. If sanctions don't work and they continue their malign activity, is there any other measures outside of a military option that can be taken, that you're considering?
The President. Well, I don't want to talk about that, but I will say I think the sanctions work. And the military would work, but that's a very severe form of winning. But we win. Nobody can beat us, militarily. Nobody can even come close. What we've done for our military in the last 3 years is incredible. All made in the U.S.A., by the way. And it's really incredible. Our nuclear was getting very tired. They hadn't spent the money on it. And now we have it have it in, as we would say, ""tippy-top shape."" Tippy-top. It's—we have new, and we have renovated, and it's incredible. And we all should pray that we never have to use it. We should never have to use it. And our military itself is in phenomenal shape.
And we have a great gentleman, as you know, going to be taking over Joint Chiefs of Staff. Joe Dunford has been fantastic. He's a great, great man and a friend of mine. But General Milley is going to be taking over. And it's going to be—we're going to have a little bit of a celebration, both for Joe and for Mark—for everybody.
And you know—as you know, our Secretary of Defense has just come in, Mark Esper. And he's been here for a short period of time, but he's got tremendous energy. He's got it. He knows it. That's what he's been doing for a long period of time, from the day he graduated, or maybe I should say from the day he started at West Point, where he was a top, top scholar, et cetera.
So we have a—we have an incredible people. And Steve Mnuchin is here. We did the sanctions today, and I think they're probably, Steve, the strongest that have ever been put on a country. We will certainly never do that to Australia, I promise you. [Laughter]
Prime Minister Morrison. Pleased to hear it.
Q. Then, one for the Prime Minister, if I may. Mr. Prime Minister, you have been very tough of Huawei, even under pressure. You've been very consistent with the ban even though you've said you have a good working relationship with China and they're important for your economy.
Do you plan to continue to support the United States in the tough stance on China? And can you give any more specifics about what you've told the President you would do to help in his measures to reach a fair trade deal?
Prime Minister Morrison. Well, I—first of all, I mean, we have a—the most perfect of relationships with the United States, and it goes back a century and more, as the President was reminding us on the lawn this morning. We have a comprehensive strategic partnership with China. This is the part of the world in which we live. And managing that relationship is important to Australia's national interest.
One thing I can always assure you, and I think the President can say the same: We will always, both of us, act in the national interests of our countries. We will always put our country's interests first. And that means engaging countries in our own region, not just economically, but at a people-to-people level as well.
We have a lot of operations we do together right across the world, militarily, and we'll continue to do those. But the focus, I think, at the end of the day, has to be what's best for our people. And that means a stable, secure region and the presence of the United States in the Indo-Pacific, where they have been for a very long time, is a stabilizing force in the region. And what does that mean? It means that countries can trade with each other, economies can develop, people come out of poverty.
The United States has had a positive presence in our region, and that's why we always work together, because we share objectives. It isn't a matter of the United States saying to us, ""We need you to do this,"" or Australia saying to the United States, ""We need you to do this."" It's about us having shared objectives and looking through the world through a similar lens. And so that just naturally brings us together to focus on the things that promote prosperity.
As I started out in my remarks today, we love jobs, the President and I. We love jobs. And we like the jobs here, and we like jobs everywhere. And when people have jobs, well, they tend to focus a bit more on the things that are going on in their lives every day and making sure they can live peacefully with each other. And I don't—— President Trump. And one of the things—important, I think—is during our meeting, we discussed, I said, ""What percentage of our—of your military do you buy from us?"" And it's—the answer was, ""We work it together""——
Prime Minister Morrison. Yes.
President Trump. ——""or it's about a hundred percent.""
Prime Minister Morrison. Yes.
President Trump. It's close to a hundred percent. And we make the best equipment. He understands that. But it's a real relationship. They buy a hundred percent of their military—and it's a massive purchase. And it's gotten bigger. I guess, you said the biggest purchase since World War II.
Prime Minister Morrison. Second War. Yes, we'll be at 2 percent of GDP next year. And that comes up from what was the lowest level of defense spending, as a share of the economy, since probably the Second World War. So that's a $200 billion investment. And a lot of that—that's being built in Australia, but it's being built in partnership with the United States and other allies. So it' an important part of what we're doing.
But I think David Crowe [Sydney Morning Herald], from Australia, was next.
Afghanistan/Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) Terrorist Organization/Repatriation of Captured Terrorist Suspects 
Q. Thank you very much. David Crowe from the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age. Further on the questions on Iran: Mr. President, you've praised the Australian commitment today to deal with Iran in the Persian Gulf. And in your talks today, with Mr. Morrison, did you discuss further military action in order to keep the pressure on Iran? What might those military actions be and what could Australia contribute to that?
President Trump. So we didn't——
Q. And, Mr. Morrison——
President Trump. Yes.
Q. ——on that same issue——
President Trump. Hold it one second. You'll get a second crack. You'll get a shot at your Prime Minister. [Laughter] I'm sure you're looking forward to it.
We didn't discuss too much Iran. We discussed more trade, more China. We discussed Afghanistan, where Australia is helping us. And we're slowly reducing in Afghanistan, as people know. We've been very effective in Afghanistan. And if we wanted to do a certain method of war, we would win that very quickly. But many, many, really, tens of millions of people would be killed. And we think it's unnecessary.
But they've been—Australia has been a great help to us in Afghanistan. But we're reducing in Afghanistan. We're reducing in Syria, where we had—you know, we've taken over 100 percent of the caliphate. We have 100 percent. When I came in, it was smaller, but it was a mess. It was all over. And now it's in a position.
And I won't repeat what I said before, with the prisoners, but we have thousands of ISIS fighters from our work in capturing 100 percent of the caliphate. And we're asking the countries from where they came—whether it's Germany, or France, or other countries—to take those people back, put them on trial, do what they have to do with them. But the United States will not keep thousands and thousands of people for the next possibly 50 years of whatever it may be. It's going to be up to those countries. We did them a big favor. We went in. We took them down. The ISIS fighters, in the end, weren't very good fighters against the United States. But we have thousands of them, and we want them to be taken over by Germany, France, and all of those countries from where they came. Okay.
Q. Thank you. And Mr. Morrison, on the same issue of Iran: Are you open to further military action against Iran, or is the Australian commitment solely contained to a freedom of navigation patrol exercise?
Prime Minister Morrison. Well, as the President said, I mean, there are—there are no further activities planned or requested for assistance from Australia. So the question, to that extent, is moot.
And I want to commend the President, who is demonstrating, as he said in the earlier press conference in the Oval Office, you know, restraint. There are other measures that he and the Secretary have announced today, and they are pursuing those channels. So the calibrated, I think, very measured response that the United States is taking has been a matter for them.
And obviously, at any time, when issues are raised with us, as an ally, we consider them on their merits at the time and in Australia's national interest. So I think that's that's heading.
President Trump. Well, thank you very much. And, Jennifer, thank you very much. First Lady, thank you. And I hope you're going to be able to see tonight—to the media—because really it's going to be a beautiful evening in honor of Australia and the Morrisons. Thank you very much.
Prime Minister Morrison. Thank you.
President Trump. Thank you. Thank you.
Prime Minister Morrison. Thank you."
"September 25, 2019",The President's News Conference in New York City,Donald J. Trump,"Donald J. Trump, The President's News Conference in New York City Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/333901",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-new-york-city-1,"The President. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Well, thank you all for being here. We've had a tremendous 3 days in New York, at the United Nations. I want to thank the Secretary-General. It's been really incredible what's been taking place. And he's been a fantastic host to a lot of countries.
The meetings I had on a bilat, or close, were pretty staggering. I think we set a new record, but you'll have to check that out. The—we met very, very—for pretty extended periods of time, either two and two, one on one, or just about at that level, with Pakistan, Poland, New Zealand, Singapore, Egypt, South Korea, United Kingdom, India, Iraq, Argentina, Germany, Brazil, France, Japan, Ukraine, Honduras, El Salvador, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, U.A.E., Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Other than that, we weren't too busy over the last 3 days.
And unfortunately, the press doesn't even cover it. You know, we have—we've made some fantastic deals, like with Japan. For farmers, we have a tremendous trade deal with Japan. And that doesn't get covered because you waste your time on nonsense.
The PMI manufacturers' index has gone substantially up, which was an incredible—Larry Kudlow, wherever you may be—Larry, please stand up. He just gave me these numbers. And existing new home sales are through the roof. Just came out. Oil prices have gone down ever since the Saudi Arabia incident, and they've gone down very substantially. So we have plenty of oil. But those numbers were surprising to you, Larry. And the extent of the increase. Is that a correct statement? So thank you, Larry Kudlow.
We think we'll make this little announcement to you because—important. You know the so-called whistleblower? The one that didn't have any first-class, or first-rate, or second-tier information, from what I understand. You'll have to figure that out for yourself. But I've spoken with Leader Kevin McCarthy and the Republicans—many of them—and we were going to do this anyway, but I've informed them—all of the House Members—that I fully support transparency on the so-called whistleblower information, even though it was supposedly second-hand information, which is sort of interesting.
And other things have come out about the whistleblower that are also maybe even more interesting. But also insist on transparency from Joe Biden and his son Hunter on the millions of dollars that have been quickly and easily taken out of Ukraine and China—millions of dollars—millions and millions of dollars taken out very rapidly while he was Vice President. And I think they should have transparency for that. I've informed the leader about that.
And additionally, I demand transparency from Democrats who went to Ukraine and attempted to force the new President, who I met and is an outstanding person. I just met a little while ago; some of you were there. I think he's going to be outstanding. He got elected on the basis of corruption. He wants to end corruption in Ukraine, and I think that's great.
But they went there, and they wanted to force the new President to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat. They threatened him if he didn't do things. Now, that's what they're accusing me of, but I didn't do it. I didn't threaten anybody. In fact, the press was asking questions of the President of Ukraine. And he said, ""No pressure."" I used the word ""pressure."" I think he used the word ""push,"" but he meant pressure, but it's the same thing. No push, no pressure, no nothing. It's all a hoax, folks. It's all a big hoax.
And the sad thing about this hoax is that we work so hard with all of these countries, and I mean really hard. This has been—I've been up from early in the morning to late in the evening, and meeting with different countries all for the good of our country, and the press doesn't even cover all of this. And it's disappearing—it's really disappointing also to those countries that are with us and spend so much time with us.
So we want transparency. We've informed Kevin McCarthy about transparency. And we said, ""Vote for it."" So I think you'll have close to a hundred percent of the Republican votes, I hope.
And it got almost no attention, but in May, CNN reported that Senators Robert Menendez, Richard Durbin, and Patrick Leahy wrote a letter to Ukraine's Prosecutor General expressing concern at the closing of four investigations they said were ""critical."" In the letter, they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake and that if they didn't do the right thing, they wouldn't get any assistance. Gee, doesn't that sound familiar? Doesn't that sound familiar?
And Chris Murphy—who I've been dealing with on guns—you know, so nice. He's always: ""Oh, no, we want to work it out. We want to work it out."" But they're too busy wasting their time on the witch hunt. So Senator Chris Murphy literally threatened the President of Ukraine that, if he doesn't do things right, they won't have Democrat support in Congress. So you're going to look all of this up.
One other thing—I'm just going off of certain notes and elements of what we've been doing over the last 3 days, but this just came up a few minutes ago: The ""Amazon-Washington Post"" just put out a fake article that Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire—who I've gotten to know, and he's a tough cookie—and I was surprised; I was shocked to hear this—was going to quit, blaming the White House for something that they wouldn't let him talk openly, freely. And I was shocked, because I know Joe, and he's tough. A tough guy.
And I was really surprised to hear he was going to quit. Before I could even either talk to him or talk to anybody else, he put out a statement—I didn't speak to Joe yet—but he said, ""At no time have I considered resigning my position."" In other words, the story in the Washington Post was a fake.
""At no time have I considered resigning my position since assuming this role on August 16, 2019. I have never quit anything in my life, and I am not going to start now. I'm committed to leading the intelligence community to address the diverse and complex threats facing our Nation."" That's from the Acting Director of National Intelligence, a very good man, Joseph Maguire.
So we're having a great period of time. Our country is the strongest it's ever been economically. Our numbers are phenomenal. Wilbur, thank you. And Larry. Everybody. The numbers are phenomenal. Our economy is the strongest in the world. We're the largest economy in the world.
Had my opponent won, we would be second right now, because China was catching us so rapidly, we would've been second by this time. And unless somebody does a very poor job as President, we're going to be first for a long way, because we've picked up trillions and trillions of dollars in value and worth of our country, and China has lost trillions and trillions of dollars and millions of jobs and their supply chain. And they want to make a deal. This year, America came to the United Nations stronger than we have ever been before: Since my election, the United States has not only brought our economy to a level that we have never seen, the most jobs that we've ever had—you know; you've heard me say it many times—African American, Asian American, Hispanic American, the best unemployment numbers we've ever had. And the most and best employment numbers: 160 million—very close to that number—in jobs. We've never been anywhere close.
Wages are up, and inequality is down. Something that people don't like writing about. But wages are up. I used to speak during the campaign, and I'd talk about wages where people were making less money 3 years ago than they were making 21 years, 22 years ago, and they'd have two jobs and three jobs. When I say ""3 years ago,"" I'm talking into the area sometime prior to the election. And they were doing very badly. And now, for the first time in many years, wages are up and employment is up, and unemployment is down. And it's a beautiful thing to watch.
In a week of active and ambitious diplomacy here at the United Nations, America renewed our friendships. We advanced our values greatly and made clear to everyone that the United States will always defend our citizens to promote prosperity.
I met with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, at length, of the United Kingdom, continuing our discussions on a magnificent, new bilateral trade deal. So we'll see what happens with respect to Brexit, but I suspect we'll have a fantastic deal with the U.K. It should be much bigger than it has been over the last number of years. Over the last 20 years, frankly. It should be a much bigger deal.
That's true with many countries. We're going to have much bigger trade deals with a lot of countries that have an opportunity to come. And they all want to do business with the United States, especially now.
Earlier today I stood alongside Prime Minister Abe of Japan—a friend of mine, a great gentleman—had a great reelection. And we signed a terrific new trade deal, which tremendously helps our farmers and ranchers and technology. The technology companies are really big beneficiaries.
We also held very productive conversations with leaders of Pakistan, India. And many other nations are achieving stronger ties of fair and reciprocal trade. And with respect to Pakistan and India, we talked about Kashmir. And whatever help I can be, I said—I offered, whether it's arbitration or mediation, or whatever it has to be, I'll do whatever I can. Because they're at very serious odds right now, and hopefully, that'll get better.
You look at the two gentlemen heading those two countries—two good friends of mine—I said: ""Fellas, work it out. Just work it out."" Those are two nuclear countries. They've got to work it out.
This week, we also made incredible strides on national security. With President Duda of Poland, we signed a joint declaration advancing defense cooperation. And crucially, Poland has agreed to put up 100 percent of the money, something I don't think you've ever heard said before. But they're going to put up a hundred percent of the money, of hosting additional U.S. military personnel that we'll be taking from various other countries. We won't have more over; we'll have—we'll be moving them around.
Poland is building us phenomenal new facilities. They're spending everything, and they're going to really do a job. But we'll be moving a few thousand soldiers, and Poland will be paying that—for it.
Together with Prime Minister Lee of Singapore, I signed an important agreement extending our defense cooperation. This hasn't been changed in many years. Then, yesterday I met with prospective members of the Middle East Strategic Alliance, which is a group that I know very well; I know all of them. And through this effort, the nations of the Middle East are taking more responsibility for securing their own future and their own neighborhood. And they're also reimbursing us and paying us for a lot of the military work that we incredibly do.
But because we're now independent, energy-wise—we're energy independent—we have very few boats going over the Middle East. We used to have them going through the Straits all the time. And you probably noticed that, every once in a while, they go after somebody else's. They haven't gone after ours yet. If they do, they've get big problems. But we have very few boats going over there. They were saying the other day, they've never attacked an American boat. And I'm not asking for trouble, but if they do, they know they have far bigger trouble. But then, they said, ""But you know, we don't see very many American boats over here anymore.""
This week also brought extraordinary progress to nations of our own hemisphere. In recent days, we've achieved historic asylum cooperation agreements with El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. We were with El Salvador today. A great young gentleman became the President. He's strong and tough, and he's taking care of crime. He was really something today. I was very impressed with him. And likewise with Honduras, who we met. We signed a cooperation agreement with both, and also with Guatemala.
We're working with our partners in Central America to ensure that asylum-seekers can pursue relief as close to their home countries as possible. That will make a tremendous difference at our southern border.
And Mexico—I have to say, President López Obrador has been outstanding—and our standing partner. And he's doing a great job in Mexico. The cartels are way down, and the numbers—our Secretary is here now—the numbers are way down. Way, way down. And we're doing that without the help of Congress, meaning the Democrats in Congress who won't give us a single vote to take care of loopholes.
We have loopholes that are so horrible, and it would be so easy to fix. And they know they should be fixed, but they don't want to do it, because they don't want to give Trump any credit, because it's all about the election. That's all they care about. They don't care about our country; they care about the election.
And the sad part is, with all of the tremendous work that we've done this weekend—whether it's Secretary Mnuchin or Secretary Pompeo, who had some outstanding, outstanding meetings—with all of this tremendous work that we've done, the press doesn't even cover it. And the Democrats did this hoax during the United Nations week. It was perfect. Because this way, it takes away from these tremendous achievements that we're taking care of doing, that we're involved in in New York City at the United Nations.
So that was all planned, like everything else. It was all planned. And the witch hunt continues, but they're getting hit hard in this witch hunt, because when they look at the information, it's a joke. Impeachment? For that? When you have a wonderful meeting, or you have a wonderful phone conversation?
I think you should ask. We actually—you know, that was the second conversation. I think you should ask for the first conversation also. I can't believe they haven't, although I heard there's a—there's a rumor out they want the first conversation. It was beautiful. It was just a perfect conversation.
But I think you should do that. I think you should do, and I think you should ask for VP Pence's conversation, because he had a couple conversations also. I can save you a lot of time. They're all perfect. Nothing was mentioned of any import other than congratulations. But the word is that they're going to ask for the first phone conversation. You can have it anytime you need it. And also Mike Pence's conversations, which were, I think, one or two of them. They were perfect. They were all perfect.
It's very sad what the Democrats are doing to this country. They're dividing, they're belittling, they're demeaning our country. So many leaders came up to me today, and they said: ""Sir, what you go through, no President has ever gone through. And it's so bad for your country."" People laugh at the stupidity of what they've asked for. And here we could do asylum. We could do all of these different things so easily. We could do asylum quickly. We could do loopholes, get rid of them.
Instead, we actually made deals with Mexico and with Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras. And we're doing it with them instead of with our Congress, but we're doing it. We get it done.
The wall is being built, by the way. It got little coverage. I went to the border. It's going up in New Mexico. It's going up in Arizona. It's going up in California, believe it or not. They really wanted that wall in California, in San Diego. As soon as it was completed, they said, ""We don't want a wall."" They were begging me for a wall. I should take it out and move it to another location.
We were with the Governor—spoke to him a lot—but the Governor of Texas, Lieutenant Governor of Texas, attorney general of Texas, the Senators of Texas—Cornyn, Ted Cruz. And we're building an incredible wall. That's going to—number one, it's going to look great. It's going to be virtually impossible to cross unless you're one hell of a mountain climber. It's very tough. It's going to be very tough to get people and drugs over those walls, because they're the real deal.
I went to the Secretary of Homeland Security, and he got all his people together. I said: ""Give me four walls, your optimum. Every single thing included."" And they give me 20-percent less, 20-percent less, and 20-percent less—meaning, less cost. They came back, they said: ""This is the wall, sir. This would be the best."" We have the panels on top, which are anticlimb panels. I don't know if you noticed the steel on top. We have a different design for a different area, but this anticlimb is very tough. They've—we had people going out—and real climbers—telling us which is the toughest to climb. But these are anticlimb panels. Very tough to get across.
And the wall is going up, many miles a week. And we hope to have over 400, but maybe as much as 500 miles, which we'll pretty much do it, because you have a lot of natural barriers; you have mountains, you have really rough rivers. You have some really rough land that you can't cross very easily. So they serve as their natural walls. But we—we'll have, we think, over 400, but we could even have 500 miles.
To combat the malice and corruption of both the Venezuelan and Iranian dictatorships, today I issued proclamations suspending the entry into the United States of senior regime officials and their families.
And further, to promote American values, on Monday I was proud to be the first President in history to host a meeting at the United Nations—I'm so surprised; first President for this. I can't believe that I'm first. I spoke to Franklin Graham about that. I can't believe it—at the United Nations, on protecting religious freedom and liberty for people around the world.
While some partisans and unelected bureaucrats in Washington may choose to fight every day against the interests and beliefs of the American people, my administration is standing up for the American people like no administration has in many, many years. You forgot the American people. You totally forgot the American people. This week, every—every week, I really can say—of my Presidency, we're standing up for American prosperity, American security, and the American way of life. And together, with our friends and partners, we're building a more peaceful, prosperous, and promising future.
We have a tremendous relationship now with a lot of nations that are very happy with what's going on, and that includes in South America, where they've been so helpful, where nobody thought this would be possible. The relationship with Mexico is an example, or El Salvador, or Honduras, or Guatemala. Nobody even knew about it. Yet we sent them hundreds of millions of dollars, and all we got back was caravans of people pouring in.
We had tremendous—we had tremendous—it was terrible. And we've got that stopped, and the countries are now helping us. And we stopped those payments, by the way. We don't pay those countries that money anymore. But I will tell you, if they're as good as they seem to be—and they're really doing a job on crime and stopping the wrong people from leaving and coming to the United States—we'll be helping them a lot with economic development projects and other things.
So, with that, we had a tremendous 3 days. It was beautiful to see. Made a lot of new friends. I read you a list of all the countries I saw pretty much one on one. And it's been very busy, but it's been very, very fruitful.
So we could take a couple of questions. I'd love some questions on some of the things that we accomplished at UNGA, instead of the witch hunt—the phony witch hunt questions, which I know that's what you want to ask, because it's probably better for you, but it's not better for the country.
So maybe we'll take a few questions. Please.
Investigation Into Russia's Interference in 2016 Presidential Election/Corruption Issues in Ukraine/U.S. Assistance to Ukraine/The President's July 25 Telephone Conversation With President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You suggested that you didn't do anything wrong in the course of your conversations with the Ukrainian President. But can you explain to the American people why it is appropriate for an American President to ask a foreign leader for information about a political rival and what you would have said if you discovered that Barack Obama perhaps had asked a foreign leader for information about you before your campaign for the Presidency?
President Trump. Yes. Well, that's what he did, isn't it, really? When you think about it.
Look, that whole witch hunt was started, and hopefully, that'll all come out. But there's been some fantastic books written that just came out—whether you will look at Gregg Jarrett, or McCarthy's book that just came out recently, and so many other books. I mean, a lot of books are coming out. When you start reading those books, you see what they did to us. What they've done to this country is a disgrace. They've hurt this country very badly. And no other President should have to go through what I've gone through.
The President—the new President of Ukraine is looking to stop corruption. There's a lot of corruption going on, and there was corruption. I just told you about Senators that threatened him with votes and no money coming into Ukraine if they do things. That's really what people are trying to say that I did, but the only difference is, I didn't do it. You take a look at that call; it was perfect. I didn't do it. There was no quid pro quo, but there was with Biden, and there was with these Senators. And they threatened. They said: ""You do this, you do that. We're not going to give you votes."" That's—that's the real deal. So we have an honest group of people that have been maligned. And you know, it's—a lot of people say I'll do even better. I'm very happy. Yesterday, I guess, we had a 53 poll, and a lot of people say add 10 points to anything. Anybody voting for Trump, you can add—anytime you get a poll, you can add 10 points or 7 points or 6 points. Take it any way you want. But I don't know if I consider that to be a compliment, but in one way, it is a compliment.
And I guess that's what happened in the last election: Far more people came to vote than anybody thought possible.
Q. So why should the American people then be comfortable with an American President asking a foreign leader for information about an American citizen?
The President. Well, I think you can look at your Senators and you can look at Biden, and you can look at all these other people. But what we're looking for is corruption. An investigation started, called the ""Russian witch hunt,"" affectionately. And it was a total phony scam. It was set up by people within the Government to try and stop somebody from getting elected.
And after that person—namely, me—won, and convincingly won at 306 to 223 in the electoral college—which, by the way, when you run a race, if you're running electoral—you know, if you go by the college, electoral college, that's a much different race than running popular vote. And it's like the hundred-yard dash or the mile. You train differently.
And I can't help it that my opponent didn't go to Wisconsin and should have gone much more to Michigan and Pennsylvania and other places. But that's the way it is. We won an election convincingly. Convincingly. And then, you had the text message on, ""Well, if she doesn't win, we've got an insurance policy."" How bad was that? You know the insurance policy? That's sort of what has been taking place over the last number of years, the insurance policy.
No, there are a lot of very dishonest people. We're the ones that played it straight. And you know what? The millions of people out there that are looking at what's going on, those people understand it. They see it. And they think it's disgusting. And our people are being hurt, and our country is being hurt.
When a Nancy Pelosi allows her position to be taken over by radical far-left Socialists, or worse, that's pretty bad. That's pretty bad, especially when the Senators and all of these other people have actually done what they're accusing me of doing, which I didn't do.
I'm going to have Mike Pompeo say a couple of words. I'm going to have Steve Mnuchin say a couple of words. And then, we'll do a couple of more questions.
Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo. Mr. President, I thought I'd start by talking about Iran. We had a productive week. We saw the Europeans take a position with respect to the attacks that took place in Saudi Arabia, making clear this was Iran, just as President Trump and I had been saying, and have now joined us in saying that the existing JCPOA framework is just not going to work. It's not going to solve the world's problems, it's not going to create Middle East stability.
Then, we had a good set of meetings with our Middle East allies as well. The President joined for a meeting of the GCC where we talked again about how we can help deter. We want peace. We want a peaceful resolution with the Islamic Republic of Iran. We're hoping we can get that way. In the end, it will be up to the Iranians to make that decision, whether they'll choose violence and hate and—as the President said in his speech yesterday to the General Assembly—if their bloodthirst will continue.
We hope that's the—[inaudible]. We hope we can get the opportunity to negotiate with them and get an outcome that's good for both of them, for the United States, to make sure that they never have a nuclear weapon and that they can't foment their terror with ballistic missiles and in the way they have all around the world. And I think we made real progress uniting the world on that here over these past few days. Thank you.
The President. Thank you, Mike.
Secretary of the Treasury Steven T. Mnuchin. As Secretary Pompeo said, on Iran, we had very good discussions with all of our allies about the sanctions program, which is the maximum pressure, and unity on the sanctions program. The Europeans made it very clear they would not do anything without our consent.
And then, on the economic front, we had the entire economic team here for all the meetings: Secretary Ross, Larry Kudlow; Ambassador Lighthizer just left to go back to DC. He's working hard on trying to get USMCA passed. But we had a lot of productive discussions. The Japanese trade deal and a lot of discussions on investing in the U.S., more jobs in the U.S., and more trade. Thank you.
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Okay. Go ahead, please.
China-U.S. Trade/U.S. Tariff Structure on Chinese Imports/Agricultural Exports 
Q. Thank you. Kristina Partsinevelos, Fox Business.
The President. I know.
Q. I want to focus on markets, because I'll leave it to everybody else to talk about impeachment. Markets reacted positively after you spoke about China, and that it would happen sooner than—rather than unexpectedly.
Yet you have the Foreign Minister of China saying that they have no intention of, you know, unseating the United States. And yet they're investing heavily in infrastructure and military.
The President. Not anymore, maybe.
Q. But what—what is different this time, though?
The President. And maybe they just say that, Kristina.
Q. What is different this time though? The fact that you're saying it's progressing.
The President. Oh, I just think it's progressing. I think they want to make a deal. They're losing their supply chain. You know, it's getting killed.
Q. Do you have something specific?
The President. Well, I don't want to say that. But I can tell you that these two men—and in this case, more specifically, Steve—were having some very good conversations.
And I guess it's next week that a group is coming in and the week after.
Secretary Mnuchin. In a week, a week.
The President. So we have a lot of talks going on and also by telephone.
They want to make a deal. And you know why they want to make a deal? Because they're losing their jobs and because their supply chain is going to hell. And companies are moving out of China, and they're moving to lots of other places, including the United States. And that's not good; that's far worse than they thought.
And by the way, in the meantime, we're taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs. We're taking in tremendous numbers in tariffs. And we're helping our farmers who got targeted. Now, by the way, China is starting to buy our agricultural product again. They're starting to go with the beef and all of the different things—pork. Very big on pork.
But if you look and if you see—and they actually put out, I think, a statement. But they're starting, very heavy, to buy our ag again. No, they want to make a deal. And they should want to make a deal. The question is: Do we want to make a deal?
Free Trade Agreements/Special Congressional Elections in North Carolina 
Q. If USMCA doesn't pass through Congress, is that it for NAFTA?
The President. Well, that would be a shame. Well, I don't want to answer that question, but you know how I feel about NAFTA. I think NAFTA is the worst trade deal ever made, although I also happen to think World Trade Organization was not one of the greats. Not one of the greats. That was the creation of China, which went like a rocket ship from the day they signed. It was—it was terrible.
But no, we're going to find out. That's going to be a very interesting question, with Nancy and Chuck and all of these people focusing on the witch hunt because they can't beat us at the ballot. They can't beat us at the ballot. And they're not going to win the President. We're having great polls. We have internal polls that are—Ohio, Iowa. Pennsylvania is looking good. North Carolina.
We just won two races that a lot of people—we thought we were going to lose both of those races. One was down 17 points 3 weeks before the race",", and he ended up winning by a substantial margin—by a substantial margin. And—Dan Bishop. And then, we had a second race, as you know, and he was up one or two points and ended up winning by—what was it? Twenty-five points or some incredible—I'll ask you folks, because I don't want to be inaccurate. Otherwise, I'll have a front-page story: ""We have breaking news. Trump exaggerated.""
But he won by many, many points. And he was leading by maybe two, maybe three, but he won by—in the twenties. So it's—it's been—so we're looking great in North Carolina, looking great in Florida.
And you had one or two Congressmen, Democrats, say, ""Listen, we can't beat them at the election, so let's impeach him."" Right? Didn't you hear—Al Green. That's a beauty. He's a real beauty, that guy. But he said, very distinctively, it's all—it was all over the place. I don't know—they're trying to lose that tape, I guess. But he said, ""We can't . . ."" Essentially, he said: ""We can't beat him. Let's impeach him."" That's pretty dangerous stuff.
Steve [Steve A. Holland, Reuters], go ahead.
Transcript of the President's July 25 Telephone Conversation With President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine/The President's Communications With Foreign Leaders 
Q. Thank you, sir. You had expressed some concerns about the precedent of releasing the transcript.
The President. Yes. I don't like it.
Q. Why did you go ahead and do it?
The President. Because I was getting such fake news, and I just thought it would be better. And now they're asking for the first phone conversation, and I'll release that too, if it's important to you. But they're asking for—because I had a conversation previous—on a previous election plateau that he had hit. The—the current President hit a couple of different plateaus. And I spoke to him, previous to the call that we released, which was a very innocent call—very, very innocent—very nice call. And as he said, we were—""I wasn't pushed. I wasn't pushed,"" meaning pressured. He wasn't pressured at all.
But I don't like the concept of releasing calls because when a President or Prime Minister, or a King or a Queen, calls the United States, you don't like to say, ""Gee, we're going to release your call to the fake-news media, and they're going to make you look like a fool."" What happens is, it's hard to do business that way. You want to have people feel comfortable.
So I hated it, but you folks were saying such lies, such horrible things about a call that was so innocent and so nice. In fact, Lindsey Graham said to me, when he read it—it was very interesting. He's a good man. He's a smart man. He said: ""I can't believe it. I never knew you could be this, really, nice to a person."" He said: ""I cannot believe it. You were so nice. I didn't think you had that in you to be so nice.""
I was nice. I'm nice to a lot of people. People don't understand that. But I was. But he was shocked that it was such a nice call. There——
Q. And if——
The President. He said, ""There is nothing here."" And all fair people say the same thing.
But I don't like the precedent, Steve. I don't like it where you're dealing with heads of state and to think that their call is going to be released. But I felt that—and you know, we spoke to Ukraine about it. Mike actually called up his counterpart, and we spoke to Ukraine about it, because we want to—because they could have been—if that they didn't want us to do it, we would not have done it.
But he actually said: ""That was a very innocent call. You can release it all you want.""
Investigation Into Russia's Interference in 2016 Presidential Election/Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr./News Media
Q. And are you now braced for long impeachment saga?
President Trump. Well, I thought we won. I thought it was dead. It was dead. The Mueller report—no obstruction, no collusion. You look at all of the things that happened.
Corey Lewandowski was fantastic the other day, as a person that they have been tormenting. You look at all the people that they've tormented, all the legal fees. People came here with bright eyes; they wanted to make life so great for other people. And they left where they spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees that they didn't have. And it's a sad thing. What these Democrats have done to ruin lives is so sad.
I've seen people with only good intention. They came to Washington because they wanted to make the United States and the world a better place. And they went home; they were dark. They got hit by Mueller's subpoenas. I think there were 2,500 subpoenas or some ridiculous number. Five hundred people were interviewed, and yet they don't interview Joe Biden and his son.
If you're Democrat, you have automatic protection. That's years and years of people putting in certain people into positions. But when you look at all of the—all of the trauma that these fakers, of course—and the press—look, the press is—much of the press is not only fake, it's corrupt. These stories they write are corrupt; they're so wrong. And they know that.
You know, it used to be—I used to get great press until I ran for politics. I mean, I used to be the king of getting good press. I was very good at it. And I got good. I mean, they covered me well for what—otherwise, I probably wouldn't be here. And once I ran, I said, ""Boy, this is incredible."" But if you see the way they treat my family—used to be treated great. My family worked so hard. The people that work with me—these people—all of these people, they work so hard. They've done such a good—look, we have the greatest economy we've ever had. We have a military—$2½ trillion. We've rebuilt our military. You don't hear the vets complaining. We got choice approved. It couldn't be approved.
But when you see what happened with the viciousness, and when you see little Adam Schiff go out and lie and lie and stand at the mike—smart guy, by the way—stand at the mike and act like he's so serious. And then, he goes into a room with Nadler, and they must laugh their asses off. They must laugh their asses off.
But it's so bad for our country. People have said—Rush Limbaugh—great man; Sean Hannity said it. A lot of people have said it. Mark Levin. They said they don't know if one man anywhere in the world, with all the men they know—or woman—that could handle what I've had to handle. And I think that's true, but I handle it. To me, it's like putting on a suit.
All right, how about one more question? A question on the economy. A question on the economy.
Go ahead. Go ahead.
U.S. Assistance to Venezuela 
Q. Hi, Mr. President. VPItv from Venezuela—Caracas, Venezuela.
The President. Good. Good. Wow.
Q. Yes.
The President. How are you doing?
Q. We made it.
The President. How are you doing over there?
Q. Pretty bad. Our situation is pretty bad.
The President. Yes. I would say ""pretty bad."" Yes. Sad.
Q. Yes. But we are fighting.
The President. And it was one of the great countries and one of the richest countries not so long ago—15 years ago. It's incredible.
Q. But we are going to make it.
The President. Right. I agree with that. And we're helping you.
Q. Yes.
The President. We're helping you.
Q. Yes, I know. And thank you.
The President. Go ahead.
Q. I have two questions——
The President. Go ahead.
Q. ——to take advantage of this. Maduro traveled to Russia and Diosdado Cabello to North Korea, two of the most antagonist nations in the U.S. interests. What can be done to contain this? What are they looking for in that country? And because the Special Envoy, Mr. Abrams, said that the Russians are willing to negotiate it. This is one question.
And the other: Mr. President, you say that the Socialists is one of the biggest challenges, you said yesterday in the United Nations. But the region is far from safe. Maduro is still a dictator, full in power. [Inaudible]—in Argentina and Brazil are on threat about the Socialists and Populists. Are you worried about it?
The President. Well, I just say that socialism will never happen in the United States. It can't happen in the United States. And Venezuela—unfortunately, I have to use your country as the example of what socialism can do, how it can tear the fabric of a country apart. Because I know a lot about Venezuela.
I've had many, many friends of mine come from Venezuela. They live—many in Miami—a certain section of Miami, I won't mention the name, because they'll say I'm thinking about my business, and I'm not. But they are fantastic people, and they like your President. They voted overwhelmingly for me. They like what I'm doing for Venezuela.
We have Venezuela very much in our hearts and very much in our sights. And we're watching it very carefully. And you know what I would say? We're giving millions and millions of dollars in aid—not that we want to, from the Maduro standpoint, but we have to because, on a humanitarian—people are dying. They have no food. They have no water. They have no nothing. They're dying. No medicine. Their hospitals are closed or—or don't even have electricity. It's so sad to see.
Let me just say that we have it under control. We are watching it very carefully. And we're going to be very, very——
Q. Russia is negotiating——
The President. We're—we're watching it very carefully, including other countries that may or may not be playing games. We're watching it very closely.
Q. But you know, if Russia is talking with the U.S.A. or Guaidó, what can you tell—about us?
The President. Just put this in the back of your mind: It's all going to be fine. We know everything that you said, and it's all going to be fine. We're very much involved. We very much know what's going on, and we're very much involved. Okay?
Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much."
"October 16, 2019",The President's News Conference With President Sergio Mattarella of Italy,Donald J. Trump,"Donald J. Trump, The President's News Conference With President Sergio Mattarella of Italy Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/333967",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-sergio-mattarella-italy,"President Trump. Thank you very much. Today it is my honor to welcome President Sergio Mattarella of Italy to the White House. We've known each other for a while. We've dealt with each other for a while. And we've had some really great conversations. We've had a very productive discussion throughout the day with our staffs and representatives. And I look forward to hosting the President and his daughter Laura at a reception for Italian Americans this evening. I look forward to that very much.
The United States and Italy are bound together by a shared cultural and political heritage dating back thousands of years to Ancient Rome. Over the centuries, the Italian people have blessed our civilization with magnificent works of art, science, philosophy, architecture, and music. On Monday, we paid tribute to the Italian explorer who led a voyage of discovery to the New World, a gentleman known as Christopher Columbus. And to me, it will always be called Columbus Day. Some people don't like that; I do.
Today, the United States and Italy draw strength from our cherished heritage, as we work together to safeguard our people and promote prosperity. As NATO allies, our countries cooperate closely on a wide range of critical defense issues, including the protection of our nations against radical Islamic terrorism. The problem is that Italy is only paying 1.1 percent, instead of the mandated 2 percent, which, by and of itself, is a low number. It should be probably 4 percent, anywhere from 4 to 5 percent. Only 8 of the 28 NATO countries are paying the 2 percent, meaning 20 of the countries are delinquent in the payment to NATO. And they have been for many years.
Germany is at 1.3 percent, at most, depending on calculations. Spain is at less than 1 percent. Turkey, believe it or not, is almost current, almost paid up. And I want to just thank Secretary General Stoltenberg, because he is going around saying that President Trump was able to raise over $100 billion last year, which is true. But it's still only a large fraction. It's a still a large fraction of the amount of money that's owed by many of the countries that aren't paying their dues.
We hope that Italy will boost its defense spending in order to meet NATO's minimum 2 percent of GDP. And I will say that they have just purchased—and we learned about it today—90 brandnew, beautiful F-35s. The Strike Fighter program is doing phenomenally well.
One of our major challenges and the challenge facing NATO today is instability in the Mediterranean, North Africa areas. And much of the volatility in that region stems from the violence in Libya, which is very close to Italy's borders. The President and I were talking about that at great length. Big problem. The ongoing Libyan conflict has led to a migration crisis, placing significant and unfair burdens on Italy, in particular.
I've asked that the European Union get much more involved, because they're not involved enough. That's a problem for the European Union. They do very well with us on trade. They had a trade surplus with the United States, over the last 5 or 6 years, of about $150 billion a year. They have to get more involved and help Italy.
The Italian Government has stepped up as a leader to fight this illegal immigration. We urge also our NATO and European partners to take firm action to halt illegal immigration and uphold sovereign borders. Immigration control is critical to national security and essential to the well-being of our citizens. Nations must be able to vet, screen, and properly manage entry and admission into society.
You know the legislation that we had passed. We have absolutely no help with—from the Democrats on our borders. Absolutely nothing. The closure of loopholes, which would be very easy to do, they refuse to do. They want open borders, and Italy doesn't want open borders. And we're not going to have open borders. And our numbers are very good.
I want to thank also Mexico and the President of Mexico for the great help they've given us. They've helped us much more than the Democrats. Here in the United States, we're taking dramatic action to secure our borders, shut down smuggling networks, and speed the removal of illegal immigrants. We're moving the MS-13 gang members out literally by the thousands. They're getting out. We're dropping them out of our country, and they can't come back.
And what we've done with Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador is, they tell me, close to a miracle, the agreements that we've signed. They accept them back, and they keep them back. It's a much different relationship than we've ever had with those three countries, and I want to thank the leadership of those three countries. We've been working well—very well together.
Our message is clear: If you enter illegally the United States, you will be promptly returned home. They're all returning home. It takes a long time, because we've had years of people coming in, staying, and that's the end of that.
President Mattarella also discussed the steps we must take to enhance commerce and economic growth between our two countries. Our nations are already investing nearly $70 billion in each other's economies. Without the burdens, as unfair as they are—imposed by the European Union—we would actually have a much higher number than $70 billion, between Italy and the United States. However, we can do more, and we can achieve fairness and reciprocity, which we don't have right now.
America's trade deficit with Italy accounts for about 20 percent of our nearly $150 to $170 billion—probably, according to some estimates, could even be $178 billion—annual trade deficit with the European Union. We welcome Italy's support for a mutually beneficial trade agreement with the EU that ensures a level playing field for American workers. And it hasn't been that for many, many years.
I could solve the problem instantly, but it would be too harsh. It'd be too harsh. It would involve tariffs on European products coming into this country. And for right now, we're going to try and do it without that. But that would solve the problem instantly because the United States is not being treated fairly.
We also welcome Italy's participation in combating predatory trade and investment practices worldwide, especially in technology. We must work together to shield our intellectual property, critical infrastructure, ports, and data security. I applaud Italy's recent commitment to use only safe and trustworthy technology providers, components, and supply chains, especially relating to the 5G networks. We will work together to take further steps to secure the technology of the future.
And speaking of 5G and how it relates to China, we've done a rather incredible trade deal—especially right now, phase one—for our farmers and for the finance industry, financial services. And it's been really quite amazing.
Q. [Inaudible]
President Trump. Excuse me? Is there a problem back there?
It's been quite amazing. The level of receptivity has been much different than in the past. China and myself—our representatives, their representatives—have made a deal from $40 [billion; White House correction.] to $50 billion in farm products, agricultural products. People said we were hoping for $20 [billion; White House correction.].*
So China has been good. And they've already started purchasing, by the way. That's already started. The agreement—we hope to have it signed sometime prior to Chile. We're going to Chile—President Xi and myself. We'll probably do a signing over there, of phase one, assuming it all gets finished up, which we think it will.
There's been a lot of good will between the United States and China over the last period of time. So we're signing from $40 [billion; White House correction.] to $50 billion. And that will—because it was incorrectly reported in the press, shockingly—that will take place—it's already started taking place. They're already purchasing a lot of farm product.
All of the banking regulations and all of the financial services, all of the other things that are included—and there are many other things in phase one that I won't talk about now—but all of that is moving along rapidly. Bob Lighthizer is with us someplace here, and he is in the process of getting it completed. Have a great staff of people working on both sides.
Mr. President, it's a true pleasure to host you in our Nation's Capital—you and your family—and your deeply personal relationship to your country; you love your country so much. Just in speaking to you for a short while, I see how much you love Italy, and I can understand that. It's really an inspiration, a testament to the patriotism and pride of the Italian people. Great spirit for Italy.
America is grateful to have true friends and allies in the citizens of Italy. We have such a great relationship with the people of Italy. The United States is, likewise, thankful to be home to more than 16 million Italian Americans. Tonight, here at the White House, we'll celebrate our deep and abiding friendship with Italy and the really incredible Italian people.
The U.S.-Italian alliance is stronger than ever before, and we're going to be celebrating that tonight with you, Mr. President. So I look forward to that very much, in a little while. And in the meantime, thank you very much. And we'd love to have you say a few words. Thank you.
President Mattarella. I want to thank President Trump very much for his invitation and for the welcome, both to myself and to my entire delegation.
The relationship between the United States and Italy are marked by a deep friendship and by common interests, both strengthened by the presence here in the U.S. of so many Americans of Italian descent. That's another reason why I'm so happy to be here on this visit, in October, dedicated this year, again, to Italian heritage.
I'd like to go back to what President Trump was saying when he mentioned Christopher Columbus, who opened up new horizons. He got to know and connected continents, which ignored one another. And based on the role the U.S. has in the world, it seems to me that he did a good job back then.
To Italy, the U.S. is not only a fundamental ally, it is also a country with which it shares the same path of democracy, a country which shares the same values of freedom, of the protection of human rights, of the respect for minorities, of the rule of law. Italy's international vision is based on the pillar, which is the Atlantic Alliance, which then, over time, also led to European integration of the European Union, which was a consistent process. These are two essential elements in our foreign policy and in our cooperation.
We are united. The U.S., Italy, and Europe are united due to our history, due to our common references, due to the culture we share, and due to the very intense human relations we have between our fellow citizens.
As President Trump mentioned earlier, we talked about NATO. And NATO is, first and foremost, a community of values, which Italy recognizes and to which Italy participates with a great deal of conviction and very factually. Italy has always contributed very intensely to NATO missions and operations and with a great deal of effectiveness. And we have substantially supported the activities of the alliance.
And I'd like to remind you of the fact that besides being the fifth contributor to NATO, Italy is the second contributor in terms of the troops it devotes to NATO missions. And after the U.S., we rank number two in the number of troops participating in NATO operations, along with all of the other missions we perform through the U.N. and in the coalition against terrorism, which has developed in recent years.
And I'd like to remind you of the fact that, as we speak, six Italian F-35s of the Italian Air Force are patrolling the skies over Iceland, within the framework of a—of the second NATO mandate as a way of ensuring peace and security.
Italy has constantly reiterated that the transatlantic spirit has to be nurtured, protected, with all of our strength in all the dimensions of the relationship we share. And with this spirit in mind, we hope—I hope—that with the new 5-year parliamentary term within the new European Union, we can foster our cooperation on trade between the U.S. and the EU.
We are aiming to define solutions that can strengthen our relationships, because commercial trade tensions are to the benefit of no one. We feel that imposing tariffs on one another mutually is counterproductive, and it damages both of our economies. And I'd like to add that we share, with the U.S., the belief that the WTO should be reformed as a way of making it more efficient and more effective.
And as President Trump mentioned, we talked about Syria. We are deeply concerned with Turkey's offensive in the northeastern part of Syria. And this attack, in a limited number of days, has already caused a number of casualties and tens of thousands of refugees and displaced people. And there are plenty of victims amongst civilians as well.
This is an attack which also has another risk, namely that of offering new space—which was unthinkable a few days ago—to ISIS and to its criminal terrorist activities in Syria, in the Middle East, but not just in the Middle East; also in other continents around the world. Italy, in line with the EU's position, condemns the Turkish operations, which are ongoing.
We have also talked about Libya, and we talked about this topic, as all of the other topics, with the spirit of friendship and in very tangible way. The current situation in Libya is a source of deep concern to us, and we are convinced of the fact that the violence and the military attacks can destabilize all of North Africa. It increases the threat of terrorism, and it contributes to creating an environment which fosters all kinds of illegal trafficking. And of course, it jeopardizes the production of energy in that country. And most of all, it denies the Libyan people the possibility of finding a peaceful solution, which it deserves after so many years.
We talked about our relationships with China, together with President Trump. And through an open dialogue with China, we want to defend the world order based on clear rules, with the U.N. at the center of the world order, and an open and fair market, one which complies with the principles of the World Trade Organization.
And from this point of view, we discussed two topics: namely, security concerning new technologies. And I'm referring to 5G. Italy has been paying close attention to our national security requirements. It has paid close attention to it, and it will continue to do so.
We also underlined the need to have a level playing field in trade and in investments so that there can be a fair and healthy trade relationship. There needs to be an access to the market which doesn't discriminate anybody. And we need to be able to protect intellectual property for all of the economic players involved without any theft of technology.
All of these topics were discussed with a full spirit of friendship, with a great deal of cooperation, along with many other topics. And this opportunity was also an excellent opportunity to reiterate the friendship between the U.S. and Italy and the very strong relationship between our two countries in—within the framework of the Atlantic Alliance. And for that reason, I want to thank President Trump very much for our meeting, for our talks, for your welcome.
And I'll be seeing you again this afternoon on an occasion which will be filled with a great many elements of meaning and importance.
Thank you, Mr. President.
President Trump. Thank you. Thank you. Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. And the WTO, the World Trade Organization—as everyone knows, we just won $7½ billion because of unfair trade practices. And that will be distributed in a fair way throughout various countries in Europe.
And we're talking to the President about that as it pertains to Italy. He thought we were a little bit harsh on Italy, and we don't want to be harsh on Italy. We'll never do that. So we'll look at that very strongly. We will look at that for you. That was one of the requests made. And we will be taking a look at that.
Please. How are you?
Turkey's Incursion Into Northern Syria/Withdrawal of U.S. Military Forces From Syria/Kurds/U.S. Military Readiness/Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) Terrorist Organization/U.S. Military Involvement Overseas/Casualties Among U.S. Servicemembers 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask about Turkey. Did President Erdogan's decisions surprise you? And if they did not surprise you, would you make the same decision as you made before in removing U.S. forces?
And I guess we just heard that UAW and GM may have been able to work out a deal. If I could get your reaction to that and what that might mean for the U.S. economy.
And, Mr. President, if I could ask you about the digital tax. Did the two of you discuss a possible digital tax as it relates to Amazon and Google? What progress were you able to make on that front? Thank you very much.
President Trump. No, President Erdogan's decision didn't surprise me, because he's wanted to do that for a long time. He's been building up troops on the border with Syria for a long time, as you know.
Our soldiers are mostly gone from the area. We only had 26, 28—but under 50. We think it's probably 28, but under 50 soldiers, and—which is a very tiny force. And it didn't surprise me at all. This is—they've been warring for many years. It's unnatural for us, but it's sort of natural for them. They fight, and they fight long, and they fight hard. And they've been fighting Syria for a long time and on the border; that's the border with Syria. And I say: ""Why are we protecting Syria's land? Asad is not a friend of ours. Why are we protecting their land?""
And Syria also has a relationship with the Kurds—who, by the way, are no angels. Okay? Who is an angel? There aren't too many around. But Syria has a relationship with the Kurds. So they'll come in for their border, and they'll fight. They may bring partners in. They could bring Russia in. And I say, ""Welcome to it."" Russia went into Afghanistan when it was the Soviet Union, and it became Russia. It became a much smaller country because of Afghanistan. You can overextend, you can do a lot of things, but frankly, if Russia is going to help in protecting the Kurds, that's a good thing, not a bad thing. But it would be led by Syria.
And Syria doesn't want Turkey to take its land. I can understand that. But what does that have to do with the United States of America if they're fighting over Syria's land? Are we supposed to fight a NATO member in order that Syria, who is not our friend, keeps their land? I don't think so. But Syria does have a relationship with the Kurds.
The thing that's common is that everybody hates ISIS. Now, the PKK, which is a part of the Kurds, as you know, is probably worse at terror and more of a terrorist threat, in many ways, than ISIS. So it's a very semicomplicated—not too complicated, if you're smart—but it's a semicomplicated problem. And I think it's a problem that we have very nicely under control.
We have two countries wanting their land. We have one country that wants land perhaps that doesn't belong to them, because they want to have a 22-mile strip of, they call it, ""freedom."" They call it a lot of things. They want to get terrorists out. You have another country that says, ""You can't have our land."" And they're going to have to work that out.
Now, with that being said, Vice President Mike Pence is going there. He'll be leaving either late tonight or tomorrow. And he was going to leave yesterday, but they have to have certain security done. He's a very important man in our country. And he'll be leaving with Secretary of State Pompeo. We already have representatives there negotiating with Turkey. We've put massive sanctions on Turkey, and we have additional sanctions on Turkey.
And when I ran, I ran on the basis, we're going to bring our great soldiers back home where they belong. We don't have to fight these endless wars. We're bringing them back home. That's what I won on. And some people, whether it's—you call it the ""military-industrial complex"" or beyond that—they'd like me to stay.
One of the problems I have, and one of—for instance, with the witch hunt, you have people that want me to stay; they want me to fight forever. They do very well fighting. That's what they want to do: fight. A lot of companies want to fight because they make their weapons based on fighting, not based on peace. And they take care of a lot of people. I want to bring our soldiers back home. We're not a police force; we're a fighting force. We're the greatest fighting force ever.
I spent $2½ trillion over the last almost 3 years, rebuilding our military. When I took it over, it was a mess. It was an absolute mess. It was totally depleted. You know that, and a lot of people know that. Honest people all know that. When I was thinking about having to do something, one of our generals came in to see me, and he said, ""Sir, we don't have ammunition."" I said, ""That's a terrible thing you just said."" He said, ""We don't have ammunition.""
Now we have more ammunition than we've ever had. We have more missiles. We have more rockets. Our nuclear has been totally updated and, in some cases, new. Hopefully, to God, we never have to use it, but we have the most powerful nuclear base, by far, in the world. And we have things that we never had before. We have a great modern military, but that doesn't mean we're going to waste it. It doesn't mean we're going to deplete it, like we did before with these crazy, endless wars.
So Turkey and Syria will, hopefully, work it out between themselves. Hopefully, ISIS will be guarded. I told—I spoke with, as you know, a wonderful man yesterday—a general—from the Kurds. You all know who I'm talking about. Some of you have seen the letter that I put out to Erdogan. I gave it to him—President Erdogan. And some of you have seen it. With the general, I said, ""Listen, don't open those doors and let them out just to create more havoc so that we come in."" Because some of those doors were just opened. ""Let's create some havoc and some political exposure for the President of the United States.""
We were the ones that—we were the ones that got ISIS. We're the ones that took care of it—specifically me, because I'm the one that gave the order. Because when I came in, under President Obama, ISIS was a disaster all over that area. I was the one that got them. We were the ones that captured them. And I will say this: that Russia, Iran, Syria, and to maybe a slightly lesser extent, Turkey, they all hate ISIS as much as we do. And it's their part of the world. We're 7,000 miles away.
I campaigned on bringing our soldiers back home, and that's what I'm doing. That includes other places too, many other places. Statutorily, it takes a period of time. Diplomatically, it takes a period of time. But you know, we're in many countries. Many, many countries. I'm embarrassed to tell you how many. I know the exact number, but I'm embarrassed to say it because it's so foolish.
We're in countries—we're protecting countries that don't even like us. They take advantage of us. They don't pay. Nothing. You probably saw—some of you wrote and covered the fact that we're sending some additional troops to Saudi Arabia. That's true. And I appreciate the fact that I negotiated, for a short period of time—a matter of minutes—with Saudi Arabia, and they've agreed to pay for the full cost of all of that deployment, and more. Much more. A very rich country; they should be paying. And so should many other countries be paying if they want this kind of protection.
Same with NATO. We're at 4 percent, and other countries are at 1 percent. And certainly, a European country benefits much more than we do with NATO. I mean, it's there for a reason. And perhaps we benefit, but not nearly as much as the European countries. Some people say we don't benefit at all. We put ourselves at harm's way. But we do that for Europe, but then they treat us badly on trade. Not fair.
So I would say that we're in a great position. We're doing what I said. We have two countries that are going to argue over their border. Hopefully, they'll work it out. We're going to try and work it out. I think our Vice President, who's a very capable man, will do well tomorrow. He's going to meet with President Erdogan. Or, President Erdogan said he wouldn't meet with anybody, and he took that back just a little while ago. And he said, ""No, I will."" And I think they'll have a successful meeting.
If they don't, the sanctions and tariffs and other things that we're doing—we will do and are doing to Turkey—will be devastating to Turkey's economy. I got Pastor Brunson home. Nobody else could do it. The previous administration tried very hard. They were unable to do it. I did it very quickly. And let's see what happens, but I think we'll be successful.
But we've got to get out of the endless wars. We have to bring our troops back home. I go to Walter Reed, and I give out Purple Hearts; just did it on Friday. I see the incredible soldiers coming home to Dover, coming home in a coffin, on areas that we have nothing to do with—we have nothing to do with. And it's heartbreaking. I sign letters all the time to parents whose son was shot in different places, in the Middle East mostly. It's very heartbreaking to see. Very heartbreaking. So I've said it. And it's through strength, not through weakness. Much harder to do what I'm doing. I could be like all of these others: ""Oh, just leave them there. Leave them there."" No, I can't do it. Much easier for me—much—probably politically better for me just to say, ""We'll leave a lot of people there, and we'll fight."" They don't even know what they're fighting for. It's much more difficult, politically. It's not politically expedient; it's just the opposite.
And I have people, even on my side, they want to fight. I say, ""Why are we fighting?"" ""I don't know."" They don't even know.
So you have Syria, and you have Turkey, and they're going to argue it out. Maybe they're going to fight it out. But our men aren't going to get killed over it. And just one other thing, they've been fighting for hundreds of years. This has been going on for hundreds of years.
So it's a long answer, but I think I've got much of it out. Thank you very much.
Please. Question? Yes. Excuse me, you had a question for the President.
Digital Services Tax 
Q. Sure. Thank you. Mr. President, I was asking if the two of you discussed a possible digital tax, and where that discussion might be going, in particular, as it might relate to Google and Amazon and others.
Thank you, sir.
President Mattarella. Yes, I understood the question. No, we did not talk about this. And of course, this is an open issue. It's very important. It is being discussed in a number of different international contexts so that this important issue can be discussed and solved.
President Trump. By the way, the digital tax, I have to say, is interesting, because I did discuss it with another European Union member, namely France. And France is basically doing the digital tax. And I'm no fan of those companies. They were against me. Somebody said I lost maybe 2 million votes, maybe more, because of Facebook. But these are American companies. And whether you like it or not, they're great, big, American companies. And I'm not happy with the digital tax, where France, and European Union is taxing our companies. And, as you know, we imposed a big tax on French wine because of it.
So, just to answer your question, Kevin [Kevin Corke, Fox News], I'm not happy about the fact that they are taxing our companies. I'm not a fan of those companies, but if anybody is going to tax those companies, it should be the U.S.A. It shouldn't be France and the European Union, who have really taken advantage of the United States. Okay? Thank you very much. Good question.
Okay, you can pick somebody, Mr. President.
Q. Giovanna Pancheri, Sky News——
Investigation Into Russia's Interference in 2016 Presidential Election 
[At this point, a reporter spoke in Italian, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Q. A question for President Mattarella: As far as Syria is concerned, in recent days, you talked about the risks Europe runs in terms of not responding to the situation. In recent days, some European countries, including Italy, have discussed the possible ban on selling weapons to Turkey. Do you think this can be an adequate way to respond to the situation, also considering that Turkey is, and continues to be, a member of NATO?
[The reporter continued in English as follows.]
Mr. President, I would like to ask you, on September 27, Attorney General Barr has been in Rome to meet with Italian intelligence officials. I would like to know if you personally talked with Prime Minister Conte to arrange this meeting, which kind of information Attorney General Barr was looking for——
President Trump. Yes.
Q. ——and if you were satisfied from the information the Italian intelligence gathered for you. Thank you.
President Trump. Well, I don't know the details; I just know that our country is looking into the corruption of the 2016 election. It was a corrupt election, whether it's Comey or McCabe or Strzok or his lover, Lisa Page—the two great lovers. There was a lot of corruption. Maybe it goes right up to President Obama. I happen to think it does.
But you look at Brennan, and you look at Clapper, and you get some real beauties. I know that they're looking into the corruption. Obviously, the IG report is coming out soon, so we'll find out.
I don't know anything about the meeting, but certainly, it would be appropriate. Because the word is—and you read it in the same papers that I do—that they"," did go to other countries to try and hide what they are doing. Italy may have been one of them. So you'll really ask to—have to ask Attorney General Barr. Okay? Thank you.
President Mattarella. Yes, Turkey is a member of NATO. And that is something very important, of course. I'd like to remind you of the fact that currently, there is an Italian contribution to Turkey. We have an antimissile system, which Italy has been having in Turkey for a number of years within the context of a NATO mission.
And the Latin said, ""Amicus Plato, sed magis amica veritas,"" which means, ""Something more important than my friendship is the truth."" The relationships and friendships and alliances, of course, don't mean that we can't say that the Turkish attack on Syria is a serious mistake. So we condemn that attack, with no hesitation whatsoever, due to the reasons I mentioned earlier.
The solution, of course, doesn't lie in sanctions. And if the situation continues, sanctions will be inevitable. And Italy has made announcements, as had the European Union. The only solution is to stop all military operations and to retreat from that area as a way of stopping all of the dangers that I mentioned earlier.
President Trump. Jon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News], go ahead.
Turkey's Incursion Into Northern Syria/News Media 
Q. You know, I want to pick up on what you—your comments on Turkey and Syria.
President Trump. Sure.
Q. Even after all you have seen—ISIS prisoners freed, all the humanitarian disaster—you don't have any regret for giving Erdogan the green light to invade?
President Trump. I didn't give him a green light.
Q. Well, did you tell him to? Did he defy—— President Trump. That's the same thing as you just—you know, when you make a statement like that, it's so deceptive. Just the opposite of a green light. First of all, we had virtually no soldiers there. They were mostly gone. Just a tiny little group. And they would have been in harm's way. You have a massive army on the other side of the border.
But more importantly, I didn't give him a green light. And if anybody saw the letter, which can be released very easily if you'd like—I could certainly release it—but I wrote a letter right after that conversation, a very powerful letter. There was never given a green light. They've been wanting to do that for years and, frankly, they've been fighting for many, many years.
And when you ask a question like that, it's very deceptive, Jon. It's almost as deceptive as you showing all of the bombings taking place in Syria, and it turned out that the bombing that you showed on television took place in Kentucky. So you know, and I'm not even sure that ABC apologized for that, but certainly, it was a terrible thing. I'm looking at this—I say, ""Wow, that's pretty bad""—and it was in Kentucky. It wasn't in Syria. So I don't know what you're going to do about that, but I think ABC owes an apology.
Senator Lyndsey O. Graham/Investigation Into Russia's Interference in 2016 Presidential Election/U.S. Military Involvement Overseas/Kurds/News Media 
Q. Did you see—Lindsey Graham just said of your remarks that you made in the Oval Office that if you keep talking like that, quote, ""This will be a disaster worse than Obama's decision to leave Iraq.""
President Trump. No, Lindsey Graham would like to stay in the Middle East for the next thousand years with thousands of soldiers and fighting other people's wars. I want to get out of the Middle East.
I think Lindsey should focus right now on judiciary, like the Democrats—the ""do-nothing Democrats,"" as I call them, because they're doing nothing. They're getting nothing done. They're not getting USMCA done, between Canada, the United States, and Mexico. They're getting nothing done.
And I think Lindsey should focus on judiciary. He ought to find out about what happened with Comey, what happened with McCabe, Lisa, what happened with Peter Strzok, what happened with President Obama, what happened with Brennan. That's what Lindsey ought to focus on. That's what the people of South Carolina want him to focus on. The people of South Carolina don't want us to get into a war with Turkey—a NATO member—or with Syria. Let them fight their own wars. They've been fighting for 1,000 years. Let them fight their own wars. The people of South Carolina want to see those troops come home. And I won an election based on that. And that's the way it is, whether it's good or bad. That's the way it is.
And if you look at this country, I'd be willing to bet anything—political instinct—that that's what the country wants. I'm going to get involved in a war between Turkey and Syria, especially when, if you look at the Kurds—and again, I say this with great respect: They're no angels. [Laughter] If you look at PKK——
Q. What do you mean by that? What do you mean by that?
President Trump. Take a look at PKK. ISIS respects PKK. You know, why? Because they're as tough or tougher than ISIS. You take a look at a lot of the things having to do—you have to say it—nobody wants to say it. We're making the Kurds look like they're angels. We paid a lot of money to the Kurds. Tremendous amounts of money. We've given them massive fortunes. And you know what? It's wonderful. They fought with us. But we paid a lot for them to fight with us. But, just so you understand, we were the ones that captured ISIS. People let some go; they opened a couple of doors to make us look as bad as possible. We have a situation where Turkey is taking land from Syria. Syria is not happy about it. Let them work it out. We shouldn't be over there.
And you should get your accounts correct. And you shouldn't be showing up buildings blowing up in Kentucky and say it's Syria, because that really is fake news.
Yes, please. Ask a question.
Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) Terrorist Organization/Turkey/Syria 
Q. But you don't think the country is worried about—about ISIS? I mean you mentioned earlier that you think some of the countries might hate ISIS more than the United States. What——
President Trump. Oh, absolutely. Russia. Russia hates ISIS. Russia hates ISIS as much as the United States does. Iran hates ISIS. I mean, we're fighting a war for Russia.
Q. So——
President Trump. We're fighting a war for Iran. If you look at Syria, Syria hates ISIS. We're over there killing ISIS and we're killing—don't forget, we're 7,000 miles away. So we're killing ISIS. We're 7,000 miles away. Russia is much closer. Iran is right there. Turkey is right there. They all—they all hate ISIS. Turkey a little bit less so, but the others, very much.
Russia had a plane blown up by ISIS. Russia wants nothing to do with ISIS. Russia is tough. They can kill ISIS just as well, and they happen to be in their neighborhood. And all I'm saying is this: I'm not going to lose potentially thousands and tens of thousands of American soldiers fighting a war between Turkey and Syria. Syria is not our friend. Asad is not our friend. That's the way it goes.
Please, ask a question to the President.
Withdrawal of U.S. Forces From Syria/U.S. Military Involvement in the Middle East 
Q. But, Mr. President, you said you withdrew 28 troops.
President Trump. Twenty-eight. They say it was 28. We thought it was 50, but it was about 28—26 to 28 troops. All accounted for, nobody injured——
Q. And what has happened since the——
President Trump. Listen: All accounted for. Nobody injured. Nobody missing. It's really nice.
Q. But look what's happened since those troops were withdrawn and since you had that conversation with President Erdogan.
President Trump. You know, what's happened? No American soldiers have been killed. That's what's happened. And other people will go in—and very easy to recapture those people that, probably, the Kurds let go to make a little bit stronger political impact. And that's okay. I fully understand it, but that's the way it goes.
We're bringing our soldiers back home. And we've done a great job. We were supposed to be in Syria for one month. That was 10 years ago. And we've been a police force. It's time to bring our soldiers back home. That's the way it is. We've had no soldiers injured or hurt. That's because I'm President. And we're the boss. Just remember that. We have the most powerful military in the world, by far.
Please.
Q. Mr. President, what is the view in Europe of the President's decision to withdraw, so—to make the abrupt decision to withdraw from Syria?
President Mattarella. I already answered a question regarding Syria. I'm not here to judge what other countries do, but to say what my country's position is. And our position is one I mentioned earlier, on Syria: on the fact that we condemn what Turkey decided to do in recent days with no possible ambiguity.
President Trump. Okay?
Italy-U.S. Relations/President Trump's Use of Tariffs/European Union-U.S. Trade 
[A reporter spoke in Italian, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Q. Donatella Di Nitto of LaPresse. A question for President Mattarella: President Trump seems to being open on discussing the possible tariffs. So do you think it will be possible to avoid tariffs being imposed in 2 days' time?
And a question for President Trump: Now, we all know your concerns concerning Huawei entering Italy's security system. Are you satisfied with the measures that Italy decided to implement?
President Trump. Well, I'll answer first. Yes, I am satisfied. They have been very accommodating. They weren't at the beginning, and they have been since then.
And I want to just thank the Italian Government and your Prime Minister, actually, in addition to the President. But as you know, I had long conversations with my friend, and they were very nice. So I am very satisfied. And we just discussed the same conversation with the President. We're very satisfied. Thank you.
President Mattarella. As far as the topic of tariffs is concerned—tariffs following the WTO decision on the EU's contribution, or the subsidies to the Airbus consortium—I already mentioned what our belief is. Let me repeat it:
I think that within the transatlantic relationship, and with the friendship that there has always been between the U.S. and the EU, it would be preferable to discuss our respective positions so that we can find a solution which takes into account the requirements of both parties. And that's wholly possible.
The alternative would be that of imposing tariffs. Currently, following the WTO's decision concerning Airbus, we—there may be tariffs. And there may be tariffs in 6 months' time concerning the subsidies given to Boeing. This is a mere race between tariffs and mutual tariffs. I think it would be best to meet and to deal with our mutual needs so that a solution can be found.
But if we don't do this now, it will have to be done soon. And I believe it would be best to find a solution immediately, instead of imposing tariffs, which would lead to other tariffs, and that would be a damage to both our economies.
President Trump. Well, actually, the tariff situation is interesting because we just—it's like I said with China, and it turned out to be true—we cannot lose a war of tariffs because the imbalance is so great between the United States and, in this case, the European Union. Also true with China. That turned out to be right. We've collected tens of billions of dollars of tariffs. We've given some to the farmers, to make them even. And now the farmers are going to have a bigger contract than they ever thought possible. They won't be able to produce even that much, but I think they will, because they're incredible, ingenious. As I say, jokingly, but probably not jokingly: They'll just have to buy larger tractors, which is probably what they're doing right now. But the farmers come out so well.
But in a war of tariffs with the European Union, the trade imbalance is so great that we can't lose that, because they do much more business than we do, and that's unfortunate. But the word ""reciprocity"" is probably my favorite word. Of all of these words, all of the semicomplicated, complicated—to me, not complicated at all—things that we're doing, it's got to be reciprocal, and it's not.
The European Union has taken tremendous advantage of the United States. Many of us come through—one way or the other—through the European Union. That's the good news. The bad news is they've been very smart. They've been very smart. Jean-Claude has been brilliant. Now he's leaving, but he's been—he's been brilliant at really helping them and not helping us.
And so that's changing now. But we can't lose that particular war of tariffs, because the trade imbalance is tremendous. It's tremendous. And if you look at what they don't have—the barriers that they put up; they put up tremendous barriers to our doing business in Europe—tremendous barriers—both from a monetary standpoint and what they call ""nonmonetary barriers.""
It's a very tough thing. Our farm products, very hard to get them in. Our cars, very hard to get them in. And yet they send Mercedes. They send BMW. Then they send Volkswagen; Renault, in the case of France. So it's a very tough situation for us for many years, but now it's a very tough situation for them. Because I can remedy the situation very easily, and there really is not any financial counterattack. Hopefully, I don't have to do that.
We are—with all of the being said, we are talking. We're talking with some new people in Europe, and I hope it's going to be successful; that way, we don't have to talk about it or worry about it, because our relationship should be a great one. But we have to be treated fairly on NATO, and we have to be treated fairly on trade with the European Union.
Thank you all very much. Thank you."
"January 22, 2020","The President's News Conference in Davos, Switzerland",Donald J. Trump,"Donald J. Trump, The President's News Conference in Davos, Switzerland Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/335421",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-davos-switzerland,"President Trump. Thank you very much. Please come on up, Roberto and Larry. Robert, Steve, come on up.
Good afternoon. We've had a tremendous 2 days here. We'll be heading back right after this conference, and I've just concluded some additional meetings. We've had a lot of them. And Davos has treated us really beautifully. It's been a tremendous success. Everyone is talking about America's unprecedented economic success. It's really the talk of the town, so to speak.
Since my election, America has gained over 7 million new jobs. The unemployment rate is now the lowest in over half a century. The average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest of any U.S. President in recorded history, which is very nice; we have some good ones. We have some bad ones too, by the way.
Unemployment rates among African American, Hispanic American, Asian Americans has reached a record low in the history of our country—the lowest. African American youth unemployment has reached the lowest in the history of our country. So proud of that. African American poverty numbers have plummeted to their lowest rate ever recorded. Doing really well.
Unemployment rate for women has reached the lowest level in almost 70 years. And the veterans unemployment rate dropped to a record low. Unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached its alltime record low also. These are incredible numbers, Rob.
Workers without a high school diploma have received the—and achieved the lowest unemployment rate ever in recorded history. And that's so important. Without a high school diploma—we have a lot of great people that don't have a high school diploma. So we have record-low unemployment.
A record number of young Americans are now employed. We have the highest number of people working in our country that we've ever had before. We've never had anything even close. We're almost up to 160 million.
And we've lifted 10 million people off of welfare. And you know all about food stamps; we talk about it all the time. But millions and millions of people don't need food stamps anymore. It's not that we've lifted them off, which we have, but they don't need them anymore. And they have jobs. They're doing really well.
The U.S. stock markets have soared, and they've reached the highest point that they've ever, ever had. We've made at least $19 trillion, in terms of wealth, in terms of wealth creation for our country, beyond the stock markets.
And we are now, by far, the biggest economy in the world. China would have caught us. They were getting very close. It was anticipated that, in 2019—this is for many years; I'm not telling you any secrets—that, by 2019, China would become the largest economy in the world. And right now we're much larger. But we have a great new deal with China. Great deal. And we have, I would say, our best relationship that we've ever had with China, on top of everything else.
And we're starting phase two. Phase one turned out to be much bigger than we anticipated, because we have intellectual property protections. We have—many of the financial deals and aspects of the financial deals that we wanted, we got done, and other things. In addition to the farmers, we've got the total, complete package for the farmers. And we think that will—we estimate that will be anywhere between forty and fifty billion dollars. The number, I think, is going to be closer to $50 billion. The most they've ever done is $16 [billion; White House correction.]. So we go from $16 [billion; White House correction.] to anywhere from forty to fifty billion that they'll be purchasing.
We're an economic powerhouse like, actually, we've never been. Jobs, factories, companies are pouring back into the United States. That's one of the reasons I've been in Davos is, we have had conversations with other leaders of other countries where we've traditionally had tremendous deficits.
I say, ""You have to move factories and plants back here."" They took a lot of them. They actually took a lot of them, and now they're going to move them back. They're not going to move them back; the companies are coming back, because everybody wants to be here. But the countries also understand that we have to balance out our trade, and we're doing incredibly well in that way.
And one of the people that was very important for me to meet from the World Trade Organization is Roberto Azevêdo. And he is a highly respected man. He happens to be this gentleman right here. I thought I'd have him say a few words.
But the World Trade Organization, as you know, I've had a dispute running with them for quite a while, because our country hasn't been treated fairly. China is viewed as a developing nation. India is viewed as a developing nation. We're not viewed a developing nation. As far as I'm concerned, we're a developing nation too. But they got tremendous advantages by the fact that they were considered ""developing"" and we weren't. And they shouldn't be. But if they are, we are. And we're talking about a whole new structure for the deal, or we'll have to do something.
But the World Trade Organization has been very unfair to the United States for many, many years. And without it, China wouldn't be China, and China wouldn't be where they are right now. I mean, China—that was the vehicle that they used. And I give them great credit. And I also don't give the people that were in my position great credit, because, frankly, they let that all happen. But the vehicle was the World Trade Organization.
And Roberto and I have a tremendous relationship, and we're going to do something that I think will be very dramatic. He'll be coming with a lot of his representatives to Washington sometime—maybe next week or the week after—and we'll start working on it.
So I'd like to introduce, just for—briefly—Roberto, and say a few words on behalf of the WTO. And then I'm going to introduce Larry Kudlow to say exactly where we are, in terms of our economy. Some of you know, but we've had some tremendous numbers just over the very recent past.
So please, Roberto.
Director-General Roberto Azevêdo of the World Trade Organization. Well, thank you, Mr. President. And I think it's fair to say that we have been saying, for quite some time, that if the multilateral system, if the WTO is to deliver its—and perform its role in today's global economy, it has to be updated. It has to be changed. It has to be reformed.
This is an agenda that is squarely before members. I don't think anybody in Geneva misses the point. I think they understand that the system has not been functioning properly in many areas. That's something that we're trying to address. I'm very happy that, in the conversation today with President Trump, he agreed that this is something that needs to happen; the WTO has to change. We are committed to effect those changes. And this is something that we're serious about.
And I am going to be, together with President Trump, as soon as possible, discussing what needs to change, what needs to be effected in the WTO, and we're committed to doing that.
And of course, I will be talking to all of the other WTO members, making sure that they all understand that this is serious. This is a path that we all have to be on together if we want to make the WTO relevant and performing to today's requirements, frankly.
So thank you very much, Mr. President. It's an honor to be with you and with everybody else. Thank you.
President Trump. Thank you very much. Great. Thank you.
Larry, please. Larry Kudlow.
National Economic Council Director Lawrence A. Kudlow. Oh, thank you, sir. So we're—I think we're coming into the new year with a lot of positive momentum in the economy. And again, I want to repeat the President's speech yesterday: These are transformational free enterprise policies, lower tax rates, across the board deregulation, energy independence, and breaking down trade barriers for better deals for exporting.
Just recently, we've seen all the confidence surveys are strong: consumer confidence, business confidence, small-business confidence. The huge stock market rally, which continues, is, I believe, a sign of business and consumer confidence and predicting an even stronger economy in 2020.
Also, lately, housing markets are very strong. We've seen some huge numbers in new housing starts and existing and new home sales. That's a great omen; it's a leading indicator. And even with softness in manufacturing last year, we're seeing now the IHS Markit surveys for PMI manufacturing up 4 straight months for the U.S. And I think that's a terrific sign of a comeback.
I think the President's trade deals have inspired a lot of confidence among large and small businesses, and I think it's going to add at least a half a point to GDP this year. I think we're going to be moving into the 3-percent zone. We still have to cope with the slowdown in Boeing. We'll see how that plays out. But I think USMCA and the China deals are going to add a lot to growth this year and the years ahead.
And the great part about this, to me—I've been around for a while—is, when you look inside, look under the hood, in this growth spurt, with 3½-percent unemployment and virtually no inflation—which itself is a remarkable development—it is the American middle class, it is the American blue-collar middle class, they have the fastest wage growth. And in fact, the lower wage folks are getting the fastest wage increases, exceeding significantly by—from what their managers are making.
And I would add also, as the President has indicated: In this stock market rally, I know it's commonplace to say it only helps a few rich people. That is just not true. Over half the households in this country own shares through 401(k)s and IRAs and brokerage accounts and so forth. You look at the numbers—and the CEA just published a great slide book on this—the bottom 50 percent has had a 47-percent increase in their net wealth—consumer net wealth—between home prices and share prices, and that is a booster rocket to this economy. It not only gives them confidence, it gives them some serious spending power, and the consumer spending numbers bear it out. So ours is an optimistic message, and I think the President really carried the day in his speech yesterday.
Thank you, sir.
President Trump. Thank you very much, Larry. I mean, when you think that, soon—it will start pretty soon. It's already started, to a certain extent. I asked them to do it. China is going to be purchasing more than $250 billion worth of goods from our country. That's massive. Those are numbers that nobody has ever heard of before. And that number can grow. It can grow. With time, it's going to grow substantially, I predict.
And then, you have the USMCA—Mexico, Canada—and that's massive numbers we're talking about there. And we made a deal with Japan—$40 billion. And we made a deal with South Korea. That's a tremendous deal also. That was a horrible deal, and we turned it into a really good deal. So it was really something.
While we were in Davos—most of you know this—we met with the world leaders—various world leaders, including the President of the European Commission, who we're going to start negotiating a trade deal with, because the European Commission was, frankly, in many ways, tougher than China. I say that respectfully, but that's the way it is. They've taken advantage for a long time.
And so we're going to have a deal. I suspect we're going to be able to make a deal. Otherwise, we'll have to do something else. And they'll—I think they're going to make a deal. They haven't wanted to negotiate with past Presidents, but they're going to negotiate with me. The President of the Swiss Confederation, who's been very nice and terrific; the President of Kurdistan—we had a tremendous meeting; along with President Salih of Iraq, Prime Minister Khan of Pakistan, and President Ghani of Afghanistan.
In addition, we met with many of the business leaders, both at breakfast today and lunch yesterday and dinner yesterday. Many of you were at those meetings, at least for a little while. And tremendous numbers of jobs will be coming into the United States.
A lot of these leaders—these are the biggest business leaders in the world, and this morning was very inspirational. I mean, these companies are really going to expand. And it was a request of mine, but what we did—we've been very good to them. They're all doing very well.
And we have companies from Europe, companies from Asia now coming to the United States. ""That's where the action is,"" as one of them said. ""That's where the action is."" So it's really been great.
And now we'll be going—we'll be leaving and going back to Washington. Okay?
Yes.
Senate Impeachment Trial/U.S. Economy/2020 Presidential Election 
Q. Mr. President—[inaudible].
President Trump. Go ahead.
Q. All right. Mr. President, do you want to hear from witnesses in the impeachment trial? Your team has been a little inconsistent on this.
President Trump. Well, I'll tell you the way I look at it: It's a total hoax. It's a disgrace. They talked about their tremendous case. And it's all done—their tremendous case. They had no case. It's all a hoax. It's a con job. Like Schiff, he's a corrupt politician. Now, I'll leave that to the Senate. The Senate is going to have to answer that. I have great respect for the Senate, as a body and many of the individuals. I have great respect. So I'll leave that to the Senate.
But this is the greatest witch hunt. This started from the day I came down with the future First Lady. The day we came down the escalator, this started. And I watched the—they've been driven crazy. You know what's driven them crazy? All of these record numbers on unemployment—African American, Asian American. You take a look. Hispanic American is numbers that nobody is even believing. They look at all of this. They're looking at this tremendous success, the likes of which they've never seen before in this country. They've never seen anything like this. And it's driven the Democrats crazy.
As Congressman Green said—Al Green. He's a beauty. As Congressman Green said, ""We've got to beat him by impeachment because we can't beat him in the election."" And I hope that's true, because, honestly, they can't beat me in the election. I don't think they can. I know what they're—I know what I'll be running against. One way or the other, it's one of them. And I think we're going to do very well.
But I think we're going to do well because nobody has done, in the first 3 years—less than 3 years, because a lot of these numbers were taken from 2 months ago; they ended 2 months ago. In less than 3 years, nobody has done the kind of numbers we've done.
So I'm going to head back, and I'll be watching it, but it's really going to be up to the Senate. We're going to have them make that determination.
Please. Please.
Q. About Davos——
Climate and Environmental Activist Greta Thunberg 
Q. Yes, Mr. President. You were the keynote speaker here, but you shared some of the spotlight with a Scandinavian teenager: Greta Thunberg——
President Trump. Oh, that's very nice.
Q. ——who you had said needs to work on her anger. She had some very harsh words about——
President Trump. I didn't say ""anger."" I said ""anger management.""
Q. ""Anger management."" Yes, sir.
She had some very strong words here that the United States and other industrialized countries need to do more. Do you still feel that you're doing enough? You talk about clean air——
President Trump. How old is she?
Q. She's——
Q. Seventeen.
Q. Seventeen now. Yes.
President Trump. Oh. That's good.
Q. But what is your response to her——
President Trump. She beat me out on TIME Magazine. [Laughter] Q. But did you hear from other world leaders and business leaders who said that they think that she has a message that you should listen to?
President Trump. No, I didn't, actually. But I would have loved to have seen her speak. I did not.
Climate Change/Environmental Protection Efforts/Ocean Debris 
Q. Do you still think climate change is hoax?
President Trump. No, not at all. I think what is—I think aspects of it are. I think that some people are—they put it at a level that is, you know, unrealistic, to a point you can't live your lives.
We want to have the cleanest water on Earth. We want to have the cleanest air on Earth. Our numbers, as you saw—we had record numbers come out very recently. Our numbers are very, very good, our environmental numbers. Our water numbers, our numbers on air are tremendous.
We have to do something about other continents. We have to do something about other countries. When we're clean and beautiful and everything is good, but you have another continent where the fumes are rising at levels that you can't believe, I mean, I think Greta ought to focus on those places.
But we are doing better right now than we've ever done, in terms of cleanliness, in terms of numbers. We have a beautiful ocean called the Pacific Ocean, where thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us, and that's put there by other countries. So I think Greta has to start working on those other countries.
Q. Mr. President——
President Trump. By the way, congratulations on your show.
Q. Thank you very much.
President Trump. They made a very wise decision.
Q. Thank you very much. And we invite you for an interview whenever you're available.
President Trump. Oh, good.
Articles of Impeachment/The President's Telephone Conversations With President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine/Trade Negotiations/U.S. Assistance to Ukraine 
Q. Can I ask you just to be clear, and for future Presidents: Is abuse of power an impeachable offense?
President Trump. Well, you've got to talk to the lawyers about it. But I will tell you: There's nothing here. I had a very innocent conversation with a very fine gentleman from the Ukraine, and it was based on that. People don't even want to talk about the conversation. I got to watch glimpses in between all of these meetings that I just told you about. I got to watch glimpses of what is taking place, wasting time, in Washington.
And I watched—they don't talk about my conversation. They don't talk about my transcripts. Remember this: When Schiff made up the phony story, and he repeated it to Congress and the world—and it was a totally phony story—then I released the transcript. There was supposed to be a second whistleblower. What happened to him? There was—wait, wait. Otherwise, I won't do your show. [Laughter] Wait. There was supposed to be an informer. What happened to the informer? All of these people disappeared. And when they saw this transcript, they said, ""We've got problems."" But they went ahead because they were already there, because they had a phony, concocted story made up.
So here's the story: Did nothing wrong. It was a perfect conversation. It was totally appropriate. The best lawyers in the world have looked at it. The Department of Justice has looked at it, given it a signoff. There was nothing wrong.
They never thought I was going to release the conversation. They probably didn't think we had transcribers or we had it transcribed or taped. But they never thought we were going to release it. When we released that conversation, all hell broke out with the Democrats, because they say: ""Wait a minute. This is much different than Shifty Schiff told us.""
So we're doing very well. I got to watch enough. I thought our team did a very good job. But honestly, we have all the material. They don't have the material.
Q. I ask you because your attorneys say it's not. Alan Dershowitz says the Framers of the Constitution did not permit impeachment on grounds like abuse of power or obstruction. They objected, open-ended, vague criteria.
So for future Presidents, is abuse of power an impeachable offense?
President Trump. Well, it depends. But if you take a look at this, and from what everybody tells me, all I do is, I'm honest. I make great deals. I've made great deals for our country. Now we're working with the WTO. You're probably surprised by that, but this has been a long-term, abusive situation to the U.S. I make great deals for our country, and they're honest deals.
And when you read that transcription—and, by the way, it wasn't one call; it was two calls. Nobody likes to talk about that. There was one call, which was perfect, and then there was a second call—I guess, a couple of months later—which was perfect.
The President of Ukraine said it was perfect. The Foreign Minister of Ukraine said it was perfect. So if we have a transcription, we have the call, and we have the person on the other side of the call saying it was good—now, here's the other thing: They got their money long before schedule. They got all their money. What nobody says—this is very important to me: Why isn't Germany paying? Why isn't U.K. paying? Why isn't France paying? Why aren't the European nations paying? Why is it always the sucker—United States? That's one.
And the other thing I wanted to check very carefully—and it's very important—is corruption. And we do that too. This was a perfect call, and I think we're doing very well.
China-U.S. Trade Relations 
Q. Mr. President—[inaudible]—Times. Thank you, Mr. President. For the phase two China trade deal, we expect—do you expect human rights in Hong Kong to be a part of the discussion?
President Trump. We are discussing that already, yes. We would like to see if we can do something. But again, we're doing a trade deal, and it's a very big deal. Phase one is done. Phase two is being discussed.
We are discussing aspects of your question, yes.
Q. Mr. President, if the call was perfect——
President Trump. No, go ahead, please.
Senate Impeachment Trial Q. Mr. President, thank you. Just to clarify on a policy question. We know that Senate will set the rules for witnesses, but what do you want? At one point, you demanded a witness——
President Trump. I can live either way. I can live——
Q. But what do you want?
President Trump. I'll tell you what I think: It's such a hoax. I think it's so bad for our country. When we have the head of the World Trade Organization here, and he has to listen to this nonsense about a call that was perfect, that nobody talks about. I never see them talking about the transcription. I never see them talking about the call, because there's nothing to say.
You read it—somebody should just sit there and read it. And everybody's going to say, ""You mean that's an impeachable event?"" If that were impeachable, Lyndon Johnson would have had to leave office in his first day. Kennedy would have had to leave office his first day. It's a hoax. And you understand it's a hoax better than anybody. It's a hoax. And that's the way it is.
Yes, go ahead.
Q. Mr. President——
Injuries Among U.S. Troops Stationed in Iraq/Iran 
Q. Mr. President, a question on Iran: Initially, you said repeatedly to Americans that after Iran retaliated for the Soleimani strike, no Americans were injured. We now know at least 11 U.S. service men were airlifted from Iraq. Can you explain the discrepancy?
President Trump. No, I heard that they had headaches, and a couple of other things. But I would say, and I can report it is not very serious. Not very serious.
Q. So you don't consider a potential traumatic brain injury serious?
President Trump. They told me about it numerous days later. You'd have to ask Department of Defense. No, I don't consider them very serious injuries, relative to other injuries that I've seen.
I've seen what Iran has done with their roadside bombs to our troops. I've seen people with no legs and with no arms. I've seen people that were horribly, horribly injured in that area, that war—in fact, many cases put—those bombs put there by Soleimani, who is no longer with us. I consider them to be really bad injuries.
No, I do not consider that to be bad injuries. No.
European Union-U.S. Trade/Aerospace Industry/China-U.S. Trade/British Exit From the European Union 
Q. Mr. President, can I ask you about the EU trade deal: Do you have any timeline for that? And if you don't hit that timeline, if there is one——
President Trump. Yes.
Q. ——are you automatically going to go to auto tariffs or is there another——
President Trump. I have a timeline.
Q. ——is there another avenue, other than auto tariffs?
President Trump. Yes. Great question, actually. I don't have a timeline; but maybe I do in my own mind. They have to move relatively quickly, but they have to treat us fairly.
The European Union was formed pretty much for this reason, I suspect, you know, if you really think about it. Why was it formed? They formed their airplane company, which does very nicely, and now is doing better than ever, because Boeing has not had a good time of it. They have—they'd better start recovering fast. I hope they do. They have some good people in there now. They have great people in the company, but they have some good people leading it now. So, hopefully, that will be taken care of.
But I—no, I have a date in my mind, and it's a fairly quick date. And if we're unable to make a deal, then we'll do even better. We'll do even better.
Q. Are auto tariffs part of——
President Trump. But they haven't treated us right. Look, the United States has been losing $150 billon, and more, for many years—$150 billion. More. I mean, really, more than that—with the European Union. They have trade barriers where you can't trade. They have tariffs all over the place. They make it impossible.
They are, frankly, more difficult to do business with than China. We have a great relationship with China now. We had some testy moments, very testy. Beyond testy. Worse than a lot of people would understand. But we got it done, and I think phase two will go nicely also.
But with the European Union—and frankly, I'll be honest, I wanted to wait until I finished China before I went to work on, respectfully, Europe.
But Europe, you know, it's so beautiful. I guess a lot of us come, indirectly, from Europe. Isn't that nice? But they are actually more difficult to do business with than China. All you have to do is ask Boris. But I think Boris is going to be okay too. I think he's going to come out great. I think he has—he had a lot of guts. He's done a terrific job. I think he's in a good position, which they would have never been able to do before Boris.
I have a date. I have a very specific date in my mind.
Q. Before or after the election? Your election this year?
President Trump. Before. I think—I think we'll have a deal before.
Q. With the EU?
President Trump. Yes, I think so. I mean, they have to do that. I mean, I don't want to—look, I'm not saying it from strength or from weakness; I'm just saying they have to do it.
They wanted to make a deal. This—our Nation, our country wanted to make a deal under President Obama. The EU refused to talk to him. And then, they said, ""No, no, we like it the way it is."" Of course, they like it the way it is; they're making $150 billion-plus, right?
And, as you know, President Bush was desperate to make a deal. They wouldn't even talk to him.
Me, they're talking to, and we'll have a deal. If we don't have a deal, we'll do even better.
Q. Mr. President——
President Trump. Yes, ma'am. Go ahead.
Restrictions on Foreign Travel to the U.S. 
Q. Is it true that you're considering extending the travel ban? And, if so——
President Trump. Yes.
Q. ——to which countries?
President Trump. So we have a travel ban. It's a very powerful ban. And a lot of—I heard a reporter recently say, ""He lost the ban in court."" They didn't say that we won it in the Supreme Court. I'd say that's a little deceptive, John [John Roberts, Fox News], wouldn't you? He said, ""He lost the travel ban."" I didn't lose the travel ban. The travel ban was lost in the lower courts and won in the Supreme Court, 2 years ago.
No, we are—we're adding a couple of countries to it. We have to be safe. Our country has to be safe. You see what's going on in the world. Our country has to be safe.
So we have a very strong travel ban, and we'll be adding a few countries to it.
Q. Could you give us a hint about the region or the countries?
President Trump. Well, no, you're going to—it's going to be announced very shortly. Okay?
Q. Mr. President——
President Trump. John. Yes, John.
Senate Impeachment Trial/Former National Security Adviser John R. Bolton/The President's July 25 Telephone Conversation With President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine/The President's Popularity 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. [Laughter] In regards to the proceedings going on in the Senate, would you like to see this over quickly? Would you like to see a thorough examination of the facts? What did you make of the dustup between the White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and Jerrold Nadler last night? And are you absolutely against John Bolton testifying?
President Trump. Well, you're asking a lot of questions. [Laughter]
Q. Three. That's not a lot.
President Trump. First of all, Jerrold Nadler, I've known him a long time. He's a sleazebag; everybody knows that. Pat Cipollone is a high-quality human being. I was very impressed with Pat. He had great emotion yesterday. Pat is a brilliant guy, but I've never seen that emotion. And that's real emotion. That's because he knows this is a hoax. And I was very proud of the job he did.
I've known Jerry Nadler for a long time. He's opposed many of my jobs. I got them all built, very successfully built in New York. But—so we have yet another fight. Isn't it amazing? Isn't it surprising? Isn't it amazing?
But if you look at, you know, other aspects or other parts of your question, I think that the—I would rather go the long way. I would rather interview Bolton. I would rather interview a lot of people.
The problem with John is that it's a national security problem. You know, you can't have somebody who's at national security—and, if you think about it, John, he knows some of my thoughts. He knows what I think about leaders. What happens if he reveals"," what I think about a certain leader, and it's not very positive, and then I have to deal on behalf of the country? It's going to be very hard. It's going to make the job very hard.
He knows other things. And I don't know if we left on the best of terms. I would say probably not, you know. And so you don't like people testifying when they didn't leave on good terms, and that was due to me, not due to him. And so we'll see what happens.
But when you have a national security—where you could call it ""Presidential prerogative."" You could just call it—the way I look at it, I call it ""national security""—for national security reasons. ""Executive privilege,"" they say. So that would—John would certainly fit into that. When you're a National Security Adviser—like this gentleman is doing a fantastic job, Robert—I just think it's very hard. And I've always gotten along—I've actually gotten along with John Bolton. He didn't get along with other people—a lot of other people. But when he knows my thoughts on certain people in other governments—and we're talking about massive trade deals, and war and peace, and all these different things that we talk about—that's really a very important national security problem, I think.
Having somebody—other people—Mick Mulvaney is probably around here someplace. I'd love to have Mick go, but I think that he's really expressed himself very well when he did a Chris Wallace interview. That was a very, very powerful interview. That was a long, tough—Chris is a tough interviewer. A very talented guy. And you know, I think it's not much he can add. He's been great.
I would like to have—I'll tell you what I don't like though—I'd love to have Mike Pompeo testify. But again, that's a national security problem. But I'd love to have Mike Pompeo, but it's a national security problem.
I'd love to have Rick Perry. Rick Perry has asked me: ""I'd love to testify. Please, let me testify."" Because he knows this is all a hoax. He understands it better than most. And Rick Perry would love to testify. But we're dealing with national security.
We're dealing with one other thing: Our country has been tied up with this hoax from the day I came down the escalator. We've been fighting it. I've been fighting it from the day I've been elected. I would say probably long before—it could be long before I came down the escalator that—some people have said that, which is hard to believe.
Q. I asked——
President Trump. Wait. Wait, John.
It's hard to believe. We've been fighting this. I would rather have—personally, I'd rather go the long route. It's horrible for our country. Our country has to get back to business.
We have people that are corrupt, like Adam Schiff, who misquotes—I don't mean ""misquotes""—makes up a statement. He had no idea that I was going to release the transcript. He never thought I'd do that. And for that, I thank the President of Ukraine, because we got their approval. He had no idea I was going to do that.
But these are corrupt people, some of them. And some of them are just playing the political game. But if you look at the poll numbers, my poll numbers are the highest they've ever been. If you look at the funding numbers, if you look at what—the money raised by the Republican Party has just set a record. Nobody has ever done this before. It's because of the impeachment hoax.
Q. I asked——
Q. No, no. Sorry. Sorry. I've got three quick ones too, Mr. President, if you don't mind.
President Trump. Three?
Q. Three, yes. Well, my husband asked three; I ask three.
President Trump. That means six.
Q. No, that means——
President Trump. Six for the family. [Laughter]
Q. ——that—thank you very much. Thanks for appreciating the family.
President Trump. Go ahead. No, go ahead. Businessman Lev Parnas/Personal Attorney to the President Rudolph W. Giuliani/Former Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr/Impeachment of Former President William J. Clinton/Senate Impeachment Trial/Investigation Into Russia's Interference in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election/News Media 
Q. Do you plan to show up in any way, shape, or form at your trial?
Number two, you called Kenneth Starr ""a disaster"" in the past. Do you still feel that way about him now?
And three, Lev Parnas has come forward and said that you knew everything that he was doing in Ukraine.
President Trump. No, he's a con man. Okay, you ready? Let me answer that one first.
Q. Okay, so would you say that's not true?
President Trump. I don't know him——
Q. Okay, you don't know him.
President Trump. ——other than he's sort of like a groupie. He shows up at fundraisers. Okay? So I don't know anything about him.
I watched Rudy. Rudy is a terrific person—great crime fighter; the best mayor in the history of New York City, by far; solved the crime problem in New York. And I think it's very unfair the way the media has treated Rudy Giuliani.
I will say this: Parnas I don't know, other than he probably contributed to the campaign, along with tens of thousands of other people. And I take—or, I mean, I was—this weekend I was taking pictures with hundreds of people. And they—they're—they contribute to the Republican Party. And I stand there, and I take pictures. And every once in a while, I'll look at somebody—I say, ""Gee, I wonder when that picture is going to be in the New York Times or the Washington Post or on Fox."" You know, so it's one of those things.
Q. So you mentioned Rudy. You still have great things——
President Trump. I think Rudy is a high-quality person.
Q. So why is he not on your legal team? Why is he not—I mean, Sekulow and Cipollone——
President Trump. Because I don't want there to be a conflict. I'd love to have Rudy on my team. But you know, he could be a witness at some point, if this whole sham continues. I would love to have Rudy on the team. He—Rudy is on my team, just so you understand. But I'd love to have him up there. But it could be that he'd have a conflict. It could be.
But Rudy Giuliani is somebody that I think the press has been very unfair to. Greatest mayor in the history of New York—think of it. And one of the greatest crime fighters of the last hundred years. And he hates to see what's happening, because he knows corruption, really, better than anybody. Okay? Go ahead.
Q. And Kenneth Starr. How do you feel about him now?
President Trump. So Ken Starr is a terrific man. I did make that statement, because, frankly, I didn't think that Bill Clinton should have been impeached. And I thought it was terrible. I didn't know Ken Starr, but I didn't think that Bill Clinton should be impeached—should have been impeached. And I was pretty vocal about that. I didn't know Ken, but what I did know is he was very smart. He was very tough. He was very talented. But in a certain way, I was sticking up for Clinton—for Bill Clinton. And you know, I felt—I sort of still feel that way. I mean, what he did was nothing good. There was a lot of lying going on. There were a lot of things, a lot of bad things.
Now, with me, there's no lying. There's no nothing. They have nothing. They don't even have a crime. They say, ""This is the only one that's ever been impeached, and he didn't commit a crime."" I didn't commit a crime. And then, you get into high crimes and misdemeanors. But I didn't commit a crime.
So no, I have great respect for Ken. But I didn't think, frankly, that Bill Clinton should have been impeached.
Q. So what do you think? Will you show up at your trial any day, in any way, shape, or form?
President Trump. I'd love to go. Wouldn't that be great? Wouldn't that be beautiful?
Q. So why don't you go?
President Trump. I don't know. I'd sort of love—sit right in the front row and stare in their corrupt faces. [Laughter] I'd love to do it.
Q. So why not commit to going?
President Trump. I don't know. Don't keep talking, because I may—you may convince me to do it. [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President——
Q. Do you think Cipollone and Sekulow would want you there?
President Trump. I think they might have a problem. [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President——
President Trump. I think they might. And by the way, I think—I think they've all—I think they've done a really good job. And I think the other side has so lied. I watched the lies from Adam Schiff. He'll stand, he'll look at a microphone, and he'll talk like he so aggrieved. These two guys—these are major sleazebags. They're very dishonest people. Very, very dishonest people.
When somebody will make up a statement that I made, when—you remember the statement. Eight times. ""Quid pro quo."" Eight times. Think of it. How can you say—eight times? That would mean I was asking somebody eight different times for the same thing? What kind of a conversation would that be? If you asked once, that'd be fine. If you asked twice, that would have been—how can you ask eight times? It would—they would say you're a Looney Tune, right?
And then, he said—I think he finished by saying: ""Don't call me. I'll call you."" That I said that. He made that statement: ""Don't call me. I'll call you."" And he didn't say he made it up.
Now, ultimately, he had to, in a sense, apologize. He can hardly apologize. But he had to apologize, because, fortunately, we had a tape. We had the transcripts. I am so happy that I had the transcripts, because it showed he's a liar, and he's a fraud. And they continue to just go on and on.
But this has happened to me with the Russian hoax. This has happened to me—I called it the ""witch hunt."" Greatest witch hunt in American history. And the Mueller report, which exonerated, totally—there was no collusion after all that. Two years, there was no collusion. And then, what happened? Jill Stein from the Green Party gets called a ""Russian agent"" by Crooked Hillary. And then, Tulsi Gabbard—I don't know either of them, but I know they're not Russian agents—gets called a ""Russian agent.""
This is what these people do; they demean. And the press plays in, because the press, largely, is their partner. And you know, one thing—if we could straighten out the press in our country, we would have a place that would be so incredible. The press is so dishonest, so corrupt. I read it all the time—the stories. I don't mind bad stories when—I deserve bad story sometimes.
But when I do something great or good, let it be written about good. Same thing with other people. The corruption in the media—as I call it, the ""fake news"" media—is unbelievable. And, hopefully, everybody is going to sort of learn a lesson.
People got Pulitzer Prizes for their coverage of me. And it turned out they were totally wrong. Other people—Sean Hannity, Rushbo—a lot of great people, a lot of great writers. They got it right. They didn't get Pulitzer Prizes, but they got it right.
The Russian hoax was a terrible thing. The dossier was a phony deal paid for by Hillary Clinton and the DNC, and used in the FISA courts, totally illegally. No, it's a terrible thing that happened.
This was a takedown attempt at a sitting President of the United States, and we caught them. So let's see what happens.
Q. Mr. President——
The President's State of the Union Address/Impeachment/Investigation Into Russia's Interference in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election 
Q. Mr. President, but would you consider delaying the State of the Union if the impeachment trial has not ended by February 4?
President Trump. I don't see it. No, I don't see it. No, I'm—you know, a very excellent writer, Bob Woodward—I guess he's doing another book on Trump, but this time, I'll actually give him an interview. He said, ""You're enjoying this, aren't you?"" I said, ""No, I'm not enjoying it."" He said: ""No, you act like you're winning and you won. You're actually enjoying it."" I said: ""I'm not enjoying it. I'm doing it because it's very important, what I'm doing.""
I consider what I've done here, with this whole witch hunt, from day one—with the insurance policy; with the horrible statements made between Strzok and Page; and McCabe; and Comey, who lied to Congress and did so many other bad things. He lied, and he leaked.
When I finish, I think that this is going to go down as one of the greatest things I've done for our country. These are bad, corrupt people. These are bad people and very bad for our country.
Thank you very much, everybody.
Q. Mr. President——
Q. Mr. President——
President Trump. Thank you. Thank you very much."

Reconciliation Efforts in Afghanistan/U.S. Military Operations in Afghanistan/Negotiations With Taliban Leaders 
Before we begin, I'd like to congratulate all those incredible people that have worked for so long on our endless war in Afghanistan, 19 years, going on 20 years.
And there hasn't been a moment like this. We've had very successful negotiations. We think they'll be successful in the end. The other side is tired of war. Everybody is tired of war. That's been a particularly long and gruesome one. And I want to congratulate President Ghani and the people of Afghanistan.
I want to remember all of the people—all of the great, great men and women—that have lost their lives in the war, and to their parents and wives and husbands and families, brothers and sisters: These are great, great people. Many lives, over such a long period of time, have been lost.
I want to thank our wounded warriors, people that are still bearing pain and all of the problems that they've had to go through. And they're incredible people. Incredible spirit. I'd go to Walter Reed and see them so often. And the spirit they had—they wanted to go back. Despite their wounds, they always said, ""I want to go back."" Wounded warriors, they're incredible people.
I guess, most of all, I want to thank all of the people in the United States for having spent so much, in terms of blood, in terms of treasure and treasury—the money that has been spent, the lives that have been lost.
And we just signed an agreement that puts us in a position to get it done, bring us down to in the vicinity of 8,000 troops. The United Nations was informed of everything. And NATO has been great. Secretary Stoltenberg has been fantastic. I want to thank the United Nations for the help they gave. And I also want to thank and congratulate Secretary Stoltenberg of NATO. Twenty-nine countries involved and all approving, all very happy with what's going on.
I want to also thank and congratulate Secretary of State Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Mark Esper.
And I'll be meeting personally with Taliban leaders in the not-too-distant future. And we'll be very much hoping that they will be doing what they say they're going to be doing: They will be killing terrorists. They will be killing some very bad people. They will keep that fight going.
We've had tremendous success in Afghanistan in the killing of terrorists, but it's time, after all these years, to go and to bring our people back home. We want to bring our people back home.
And, again, it's been a long journey in Afghanistan in particular. It's been a very long journey. It's been a hard journey for everybody. We're, very largely, a law enforcement group. And that's not what our soldiers are all about. They're fighters. They're the greatest fighters in the world.
As you know, we've destroyed, in Syria and Iraq, 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate. One hundred percent. We have thousands of prisoners. We've killed ISIS fighters by the thousands—and, likewise, in Afghanistan. But now it's time for somebody else to do that work, and that will be the Taliban, and it could be surrounding countries. There are many countries that surround Afghanistan that can help. We're 8,000 miles away.
So we'll be bringing it down to 8,000, to approximately 8,600—in that vicinity—and then we'll make our final decision some point in the fairly near future. But this was a very spirited agreement. There was a lot of talk. There was a lot of everything. They've been trying to get this for many years. And just, it's time.
So I just want to thank everybody. I want to congratulate everybody. I really believe the Taliban wants to do something to show that we're not all wasting time. If bad things happen, we'll go back. I let the people know: We'll go back, and we'll go back so fast, and we'll go back with a force like nobody has ever seen. And I don't think that will be necessary. I hope it's not necessary.
And so I just wanted to bring that up, before we begin, on a topic that has become very, very important to everybody.
White House Coronavirus Task Force 
First of all, the amount of work that these professionals behind me and many other professionals in many rooms behind us who are watching right now—we don't have the room here to bring them all in—but they have been working around the clock, so hard, on the coronavirus. It's a tough one, but a lot of progress has been made.
I want to provide an update to our people, to our citizens—to the world, frankly—on our action to address the coronavirus and those that have been hurt badly by it. At this moment, we have 22 patients in the United States currently that have coronavirus. Unfortunately, one person passed away overnight. She was a wonderful woman, a medically high-risk patient in her late fifties. Four others are very ill. Thankfully, 15 are either recovered fully, or they're well on their way to recovery. And in all cases, they've been let go, and they're home.
Additional cases in the United States are likely, but healthy individuals should be able to fully recover. And we think that will be a statement that we can make with great surety now that we've gotten familiar with this problem. They should be able to recover should they contract the virus. So, healthy people, if you're healthy, you will probably go through a process, and you'll be fine.
Since the early stages of the foreign outbreak, my administration has taken the most aggressive action in modern history to confront the spread of this disease. We moved very early. That was one of the decisions we made that really turned out to be a lifesaver, in a sense. A big lifesaver.
On January 31, I imposed travel restrictions on foreign nations who had—and anybody that had been to China or people coming out of China. And I want to say that China seems to be making tremendous progress. Their numbers are way down. And if you read, Tim Cook of Apple said that they are now in full operation again in China. Their numbers are way down.
Experts now agree that the decision to move so quickly, despite a lot of opposition on that decision, was a wise one. It greatly slowed the spread of the virus to the United States, and it really gave us time to do some of the critical moves that we've done. And it allowed these great professionals to get together and figure it all out. And we think they've done that.
We've taken the most aggressive actions to confront the coronavirus. They are the most aggressive taken by any country. And we're the number-one travel destination anywhere in the world, yet we have far fewer cases of the disease than even countries with much less travel or a much smaller population. As an important part of our efforts, on Monday, I'll be meeting with the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, actually. They'll be coming to the White House, and we're talking about a vaccine and developing, very quickly—and they've already started working on it—developing, very rapidly, a vaccine for the virus, to combat the virus. And we're having very good initial feedback. But the—these companies will be coming to the White House on Monday.
Tremendous amounts of supplies are already on hand. We have 43 million masks, which is far more than anyone would have assumed we could have had so quickly, and a lot more are coming.
Today the White House Coronavirus Task Force, led by Vice President Mike Pence, they met for 2½ hours. I spent a lot of that time with them also, and we came up with some ideas, recommendations, and frankly, some pretty strict edicts that we're going to be going by. And Mike is going to be discussing that.
But we are really having a group of people that is so talented and they're working around the clock. And for that reason, I really would wish that we could really—that we could report exactly what's happened: how well we're doing under quite adverse circumstances.
But we're doing really well. Very, very professionally handled. Our country is prepared for any circumstance. We hope it's not going to be a major circumstance; it will be a smaller circumstance. But whatever the circumstance is, we're prepared.
And I'd like to just ask and caution that the media—we would respectfully ask the media and politicians and everybody else involved not do anything to incite a panic, because there's no reason to panic at all.
This is something that is being handled professionally. I also want to thank, by the way, Governors and representatives of our various States—in some cases, some more than others—because they've really been working very hard in areas where we've seen indication of the virus. But I want to thank the Governors and all of the representatives from all of our States. The rooms they've made available, the speed with which they've worked, has really been incredible.
So, again, thank you to everybody. I'm going to ask Mike Pence now to discuss a little bit about travel. And we have some restrictions on some travel from other countries that are having a hard time. And I want to thank everybody.
And we'll take some questions as soon as we're finished. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Vice President Michael R. Pence. Well, thank you, Mr. President. Let me begin, as the President did, by expressing our deepest condolences to the family of the woman in Washington State who's lost her life to the coronavirus. I want to assure that family that they're on the hearts of every American. And those that are continuing to struggle—in some cases, in ICU units—can be assured of the prayers of millions of Americans.
From the moment that this country learned of the spread of the coronavirus, President Donald Trump took decisive action and established the White House Coronavirus Task Force. And as the President just described, the President took unprecedented action to suspend all travel into the United States from China. It simply had never been done before by any previous administration. And it is among the reasons why the threat to Americans of coronavirus remains low, despite today's tragic news from Washington State.
The Task Force met this morning and brought the President a range of options. And at his direction, we will be doing the following. First, the President authorized action today to add additional travel restrictions on Iran. We will be using section 212(f), banning travel from Iran. Iran is already under a travel ban, but we are expanding existing travel restrictions to include any foreign national who has visited Iran within the last 14 days.
In addition to moving Iran, we are going to increase to the highest level of advisory—which is level four—advising Americans do not travel to specific regions in Italy and South Korea. Let me say again: The President today has authorized the State Department to increase the travel advisory for Americans to level four. We are urging Americans to not travel to the areas in Italy, and the areas in South Korea, that are most affected by the coronavirus.
The President has also directed the State Department to work with our allies in Italy and in South Korea to coordinate a screening—a medical screening—in their countries of any individuals that are coming into the United States of America. And we look forward to working with them in a collaborative and a cooperative way.
Now, with regard to the Task Force, I'm just a few days into this job, but I can tell you, having spent time with these extraordinary professionals that the President just alluded to, having spoken directly to more than a dozen Governors—including Governor Jay Inslee this morning in Washington State—I am—I think every American would be proud to know what I've heard about the work of HHS, the work of CDC, the work of all of our agencies.
At the President's direction, this team has been working seamlessly with health officials at the State and local level. And I can assure the American public that we will continue to live out the President's admonition a few days ago that we're all in this together.
And as we work with Members of Congress—I've had the opportunity to speak with Republican and Democrat leadership in the Congress—we'll be working very closely on a supplemental funding bill to make sure that not only do all these agencies have the resources that they require, but we'll also make sure that State and local health officials have the resources and the reimbursement to take such actions that are necessary to protect the health of the American people.
The President mentioned masks. This morning we talked a great deal about additional medical supplies. Let me be very clear—and I'm sure the physicians who are up here will reflect this as well: The average American does not need to go out and buy a mask.
But this administration is going to always put first our patients, first. And second, we're going to make sure and protect the health of our health care providers. As the President said, we have more than 40 million masks available today. We've contracted now with 3M to—35 million more masks per month will be produced, and we're also going to be working with other manufacturers.
In addition to that, the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response will be announcing today courses of action to increase the availability of masks, as well as prioritizing availability to high-risk health care workers, modifying guidance, and developing a whole-of-nations communications plan. The President wants us to be certain that our health care providers have the support they need to do their job and to do their job safely.
So, with that, I'm going to yield the podium to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and then we'll hear from some of our medical experts. But let me assure every American: At President Trump's direction, this is an all-hands-on-deck effort.
And while the risks to Americans remain low, the President's actions today with regard to Iran, with regard to Italy, and with South Korea, and with regard to making medical supplies more available, I hope gives evidence to the fact that, at his direction, we're going to continue to lean into this effort and put the health and safety of the American people first.
Mr. Secretary.
Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex M. Azar II. Great. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Let me begin by, on behalf of all of the officials at HHS and our whole teams, expressing our sadness for the loss of this patient in the State of Washington. Any single death for us is a real tragedy. And our sympathy to her family and our solidarity with all those who are and will suffer from the novel coronavirus.
From day one, this is what we predicted; this is what we expected. The risk to any average American is low, from the novel coronavirus. The risk remains low. Thanks to the unprecedented actions President Trump has taken and the actions he's announcing today, that risk remains low.
But this can change rapidly. We have always said, from the first moment that we have spoken about this, that we would see more cases. We are seeing more cases. We will see more cases.
But it's important to remember: For the vast majority of individuals who contract the novel coronavirus, they will experience mild to moderate symptoms, and their treatment will be to remain at home, treating their symptoms the way they would a severe cold or the flu. For some individuals, a smaller percentage, especially those who may be medically fragile, they will require medical attention, including possibly hospitalization.
Our basic message in terms of the containment of this disease and the measures that we have and are—taken and are today announcing is: We want to lower the amount of travel to and from the most impacted areas. This is a basic containment strategy. That is the philosophy behind the moves that we have taken, the moves we're announcing today, and any moves that we will consider in the future.
With that said, let me turn things over to Dr. Tony Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease at NIH. Thank you very much.
Dr. Fauci.
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony S. Fauci. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. I want to first, again, as the entire team feels, to extend our sympathies to the family of the individual who expired as a result of this particular virus and this particular disease.
But I also want to underscore and emphasize the points that the Secretary made about what is evolving here. You've heard of the terminology ""community spread."" Well, community spread is when you have infection in the community in which you don't have a direct link to a known index case. That really challenges us with something that we need to do and that we do very well. The State and local health authorities, in collaboration with the CDC, would need to identify, isolate, and contact trace. And that's what's going on right here in the country.
With regard to the particular area that's involved now in Washington, the country as a whole—because we get asked that all the time—still remains at low risk. But when we say that, we want to underscore that this is an evolving situation. And in real time, we will keep you appraised of what is going on just the same way as though we are doing it today.
So how do you address this new challenge? There's what we do from within and what we do from without. I harken back to the original decision that was made by the President of making sure that we knew the scenario that was going on in China. We prevented travel from China to the United States. If we had not done that, we would have had many, many more cases right here that we would have to be dealing with.
So in that spirit, the approach is going to be as we address this challenge, which is going to evolve by the day and by the week, to do what was just mentioned: to try and keep our citizens from going to places that are active infection and to prevent places where there are active infection to necessarily easily get here. That's the getting it from without to within.
From within, we will very aggressively do the kind of public health measures that would, hopefully, contain this. But as we say this, we need to prepare for further challenges. And we will have them. You will hear about additional cases that will be coming on. You should not be surprised by that, but to realize that that is something that is anticipated when you get community spread.
So when you have cases throughout the world, the way we're seeing now—South Korea, Italy, Iran, and places like that—the United States cannot be completely immune to that. The challenge is how we deal with it. And I can assure you, all the resources that are necessary are going to be put into dealing with what we see evolving right now.
And again, we'd be happy to answer any questions later. But, Bob, do you want to say a few words?
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert R. Redfield. I also want to add my prayers and sympathies for those that are sick and obviously our citizen that unfortunately died last night.
Currently, as said, there's 22 cases in the United States. And these initial cases were really linked to travel to China and their contacts. Recently, as was stated, we've confirmed new cases with no link to travel history or contacts. And the health departments, under the leadership of the States, and local health departments supported by CDC, are aggressively evaluating these cases in California, Oregon, and Washington.
As was said, we should anticipate to see additional cases and clusters in the days ahead, and we will continue to aggressively evaluate them by the State and local and Territorial and Tribal health departments, in conjunction with CDC, by embracing early case recognition, isolation, contact tracing, and begin to do that to limit the further spread.
I want to also add my emphasis to what was said: That as we stand here today, the risk of the American public remains low. As was said, we should anticipate more cases, but again, the current risk to the American public remains low.
Vice President Pence. Great. Do you want to take a question or two?
Coronavirus Containment Efforts in the U.S. 
Q. Mr. President, if I could just ask you: You said the other day, in the Cabinet Room with African American leaders, you've got to get away from politics. You were down in Charleston last night, using the word ""hoax"" when talking about Democrats. Somebody now is dead from this. Do you regret that kind of talk?
The President. No, no, no. ""Hoax"" referring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody, because we've done such a good job. The hoax is on them, not—I'm not talking about what's happening here; I'm talking what they're doing. That's the hoax. That's just a continuation of the hoax, whether it's the impeachment hoax or the ""Russia, Russia, Russia"" hoax. This is what I'm talking about. Certainly not referring to this. How could anybody refer to this? This is very serious stuff.
But the way they refer to it—because these people have done such an incredible job, and I don't like it when they are criticizing these people. And that's the hoax. That's what I'm talking about.
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony S. Fauci/White House Messaging on Coronavirus Prevention Efforts 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. And I'm just going to ask you directly about this with regard to the flow of information. From the very beginning, you received a lot of criticism regarding that, in particular about Dr. Anthony Fauci. He is world-renowned in contagious diseases, and there were reports out there that he was being muzzled. Can you tell us that this widely respected expert, Dr. Fauci, will have every opportunity to tell us the truth——
The President. Well, that's a very dishonest——
Q. ——and the facts?
The President. ——a very dishonest question, because he has——
Q. Why is that dishonest?
The President. Because he has had that ability to do virtually whatever he's wanted to do. And in fact——
Q. So he's not being muzzled——
The President. In fact——
Q. ——in any way?
The President. He was never muzzled.
Q. Okay.
The President. I think I can speak—you can speak. Why don't you speak to that?
Q. Because there have been a lot of reports out there.
The President. A very dishonest question, but that's okay.
Q. No, it's not dishonest. I want to clarify, Mr. President.
The President. It is dishonest.
Q. I want to clarify.
Director Fauci. So let me clarify. I have never been muzzled ever, and I've been doing this since the administration of Ronald Reagan. I'm not being muzzled by this administration.
What happened—which was misinterpreted—is that we were set up to go on some shows, and when the Vice President took over, we said, ""Let's regroup and figure out how we're going to be communicating."" So I had to just stand down on a couple of shows and resubmit for clearance. And when I resubmitted for clearance, I got cleared. So I have not been muzzled at all. That was a real misrepresentation of what happened.
Q. Dr. Fauci——
Restrictions on Foreign Travel to the U.S./Border Security 
Q. Are you considering——
The President. Steve [Steve A. Holland, Reuters], go ahead.
Q. Sir, are you considering other travel restrictions?
The President. Yes.
Q. And what about closing the southern border?
The President. We are looking also at southern border. In fact, some of the folks are here right now. Ken is here someplace.
And yes, we are thinking about southern border. We have received a lot of power on the southern border over the last couple of years from the courts. But we are looking at that very strongly.
Q. Mr. President——
Coronavirus Prevention Efforts in the U.S. 
Q. And, sir, if I could follow up, how should Americans prepare for this virus? Should they go on with their daily lives? Change their routine? What should they do?
The President. Well, I hope they don't change their routine. But maybe, Anthony, I'll let you—I'll let you answer that. Or Bob? Do you want to answer that? Please.
Director Redfield. Sure, Mr. President. Thank you. I think it's really important that—as I said, the risk at this time is low. The American public needs to go on with their normal lives. Okay?
We're continuing to aggressively investigate these new community links. We're going to continue to be transparent in relating that to the American public. But at this stage, again, the risk is low. We need to go on with our normal lives.
Q. Mr. President——
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Go ahead.
Global Coronavirus Outbreak 
Q. Mr. President, thank you very much. Increasing of the coronavirus in South Korea, are you worried about the U.S. troops in South Korea now? Now did you consider that—[inaudible]?
The President. Well, we care very much for the troops. We're in constant touch with the troops. We've been speaking to the general, as you probably know. Thirty-two thousand troops in South Korea. And that's all working out fine.
And we're in touch—we were in touch with the authorities in South Korea too.
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Yes.
Coronavirus Prevention Efforts in the U.S./Foreign Travel Restrictions to the U.S. 
Q. What responsibility do feel, as you're communicating about this, for the public to follow your directions and to take the prudent steps? And then, when you did use the word ""hoax,"" couldn't that cause some people to not take the precautionary steps because they are linking what you're saying, when you use the word ""hoax,"" in the context of coronavirus?
The President. Okay, so, again, the ""hoax"" was used with respect to Democrats and what they were saying. It was a hoax, what they were saying. And that was very clear, if you'd read the words. And I think you know that too.
As far as what responsibility: My great responsibility—I think the biggest decision we made was going very early. And that was a decision made against a lot of people that thought we shouldn't do that. That's why we're at 22 instead of a much higher number. It would have been a much higher number. That was a big decision. It was a hard decision because it had never been done before anyway. I mean, not even early or late. It had never been made, a decision like that. So that was big.
And my next thing is really getting the best people. We have the best people in the world. They're standing behind me. These people are so talented. I've seen them in action now for a number of weeks, actually, but for—in particular, for the last 4 or 5e days. And I want to thank Mike Pence and everybody for the job they're doing. We have a great team. We have great people. And this too will end.
Q. Are there certain——
The President. Go ahead. Please. Go.
Coronavirus/Precautions Taken at the White House To Protect the President 
Q. Mr. President, you talked about people going about their routine. I did want to ask, though: With you and the Vice President, is the White House taking any extra precautions to make sure that you don't come in contact with the virus, either through your travel or with who you meet?
The President. Well, I think so. I mean, we lead a life. I've—I get around. I was in South——
The President's Preventative Health Measures 
Q. Did you get a flu shot?
The President. I did.
I was in South Carolina last night. We had a tremendous rally. I've been around. I think we're going to be in very good shape.
You know, you're talking about 22 people right now in this whole, very vast country. So I think we'll be in very good shape.
Q. Mr. President——
Q. If I may, a couple of questions for Dr. Fauci about——
The President. Yes. Please.
Q. ——some particulars about the virus. Dr. Fauci, what do you now understand about the morbidity? I mean, the Secretary referred to medically fragile people. Are you confident that if you're a relatively healthy young person that this will not be fatal for you?
Director Fauci. Yes, okay. So the ""n""—the number in our country—currently is low. But when you look at the pattern, it seems to be following the experiences that others have had. It's never 100 percent. If you look at the totality of the cases that have been reported, particularly from China, about 75 to 80 percent of them would do really quite well. They would just sort of, like, a bad flu or a cold. You get anywhere from 15- to 20-, 20-some-odd percent who are going to go on to require advanced medical care: hospitalization, possibly intensive care.
For the most part, the people who get in trouble and ultimately, tragically, would die from this are people who are elderly and/or have underlying conditions: heart disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes, obesity, because of the difficulty in breathing back and forth.
However, every once in a while, you're going to see a one-off; you're going to see a 25-year-old person, who looks otherwise well, that's going to get seriously ill. But the vast majority of the people who get into trouble do have these underlying conditions. And that's why it confuses people, because they say, ""Well, you just said that, and then there's a report of a 40-year-old physician from China who died."" That's going to happen. That happens with influenza. Most of the time, influenza kills people who are advanced age and underlying conditions. But you hear in the media, every once in a while, a college student would get infected and ultimately die. But the majority is in that risk group.
Q. And one more technical question.
Director Fauci. Yes.
Q. Have you determined whether there are any variants of this virus so that a person who may have gotten it, and then gotten over it, could get it again?
Director Fauci. No, there's no indication that that's going on at all. If this virus acts like other viruses—which I have no reason to believe it won't—once you've gotten infected and recovered, you're not going to get infected with the same virus.
Q. Mr. President——
Q. [Inaudible]—on the economy?
Director-Designate"," of National Intelligence Representative John L. Ratcliffe/Afghanistan/Reconciliation Efforts 
Q. I want to ask you about the peace deal in Doha between the Taliban and the U.S.
The President. Right.
Q. Does this mean the war in Afghanistan is over? Is the Taliban in charge? And secondly, Congressman John Ratcliffe, why are you renominating him?
The President. Well, he's a terrific man. He's been fantastic at everything he's done. He's highly respected. He wanted to wait until after the IG report came in, as you saw originally. I don't think he was officially or formally nominated. His name was thrown out. But he wanted to wait until after the IG report. The IG report has now come, and we've learned a lot of very bad things from the IG report, as you know very well.
And I think he'll go through a process, and it will go fairly quickly. He's a very respected man, somebody that I've gotten that like; somebody who really has—he's someone who's really distinguished himself and, I think, over the last year and a half, 2 years, in particular. So we're very happy with that.
As far as the Taliban is concerned, everybody wanted this to happen. The Taliban wanted it to happen. President Ghani was very much involved in this, as you know. And he's now dealing with the Taliban.
But we're talking about 19 years we've been there. Nineteen years. And other Presidents have tried to do this. The Taliban has given a pledge—and a very strong pledge—and we'll see how that all works out. We hope it's going to work out very well. I think they have big incentives to do it, but they have to take care of the terrorists and kill the terrorists. We'll be working in a different kind of a fashion toward that end.
But the job we've done has been fantastic—a fantastic one in terms of terrorists and terrorism, and it's time for our people to start coming home.
Q. If I could follow up——
Q. Mr. President——
Coronavirus Outbreak in China/Coronavirus Containment Efforts
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned the drop of spread in China, the coronavirus cases. Is the U.S. Government considering evaluating similar measures in the U.S. in case the situation gets worse?
The President. Some measures. We've been in very close contact with China, including myself with President Xi. He very much wanted this to happen. He wanted this to get out and finished and be done. He worked—he's been working very, very hard, I can tell you that. And they're making a lot of progress in China.
You probably saw Starbucks are now opened again. You probably saw that—as I mentioned, Tim just came out, and he said Apple is back to normal in terms of production in their facilities in China. They've made a lot of progress.
Q. Mr. President——
Q. Thank you. Thank you. A couple of questions. One of them technical. The woman who passed away, did she travel to South Korea, or is she a case of community spread?
Director Redfield. Oops. Yes, the case—again, this is why we're talking about the community cases with no link to travel. So the investigation at this time shows no evidence of link to travel or a known contact.
Q. Okay. And also, you said that Americans as a whole are at a low risk. Are Americans on the West Coast of the United States at a low risk? And are you considering restricting travel within the United States?
Director Redfield. So I just want to emphasize again that the Americans, independent of where they live in this Nation, are at low risk. All right? And we're going to continue to evaluate aggressively these unlinked cases as we see them. And as we learn, we'll obviously communicate that.
Border Security/Mexico's Immigration Enforcement Cooperation With U.S./Coronavirus Containment Efforts 
Q. Thank you so much, Mr. President. Why are you considering closing the border with Mexico, since there are so many more cases here than there? And another question: Are you working with the governments from Brazil and Mexico to try to coordinate a response about this? Or did you talk to President Bolsonaro?
The President. Well, we have a great relationship, as you know, with Mexico. We have 27,000 soldiers—their soldiers—on our border doing a fantastic job. Our numbers are way down of people coming into our country illegally.
We have ports of entry that we are keeping open. And we're not talking about it; we're thinking about all borders. We have to think about that border. But right now that is not a border as it pertains to what we're talking about here. This is not a border that seems to be much of a problem right now. We hope we won't have to do that.
Yes, please go ahead.
Q. Mr. President, if I could follow on Afghanistan——
The President. No, no. You weren't—please.
China-U.S. Relations/Coronavirus Outbreak in China/Coronavirus Containment Efforts 
Q. Thanks. Thank you very much, President. I'm just wondering what's the communication with China look like right now? And does the experience and lessons coming from China will help the U.S. dealing with the current situation?
The President. Well, I think our relationship with China is very good. We just did a big trade deal. We're starting on another trade deal with China, a very big one. And we've been working very closely. They've been talking to our people, we've been talking to their people, having to do with the virus.
No, our relationship with China is very good. Maybe it's closer because of what's happened here, because it was——
Q. So you are not thinking about——
The President. You know, in a certain way, this can bring the world closer, if you want to know. It can really do that.
Go ahead.
Afghanistan/Reconciliation Efforts/U.S. Involvement in the Middle East 
Q. On Afghanistan, if I could just follow up.
The President. Yes.
Q. You pride yourself on a dealmaker, but your former National Security Adviser, John Bolton, has said that this is an Obama-style deal and sends the wrong message to ISIS and Al Qaida. What did the Taliban give up here?
The President. You know, first of all——
Q. And will——
The President. Yes.
Q. And will you be hosting the Taliban in Washington, at Camp David? Or will you meet them abroad?
The President. We'll look at that. Look, nobody should be criticizing this deal after 19 years. He had his chance; he didn't do it. He was very much in favor of going in. We should have never gone in in the first place, when they went into——
Q. Should have never gone into Afghanistan?
The President. ——when they went into Iraq.
Q. You—[inaudible]—with Iraq.
The President. Listen. Listen. When they went into Iraq, when they went into the Middle East in such a fashion, I was very much against it. Shouldn't have gone in. He thought we should have. That's been proven wrong.
I'm surprised that anybody would be against something where we try and end a 19-year war. We're 8,000 miles away from our home. We've done a great job, in the sense that we've killed a lot of terrorists, we've put them out of commission. Who knows what they would have done if we didn't do that. But it's time for us to come home.
Now, the Taliban, working with other nations perhaps—because you're surrounded by other very strong nations. And whether it's Pakistan or Iran or lots of other places, including Russia, they can all work on this. We've been doing it for nations that are surrounding Afghanistan. Now it's time for us to start coming home.
Q. Mr. President——
The President. And I think it's a very good situation. President Ghani is working on it very hard. We'll see how that works out. But the United States has done great services for people all over the world that, frankly, I don't think they've been given the, really—the kind of respect that they should be given for what we've done. What we have done for the world is incredible. And usually, we don't even get a ""thank you.""
In Afghanistan, we did something. And I will tell you, for the most part—I noticed he was negative, but he should have tried to do something better. He was here for a year; he could have done something better. I was all ears, and he wasn't able to do that.
The deal has a chance to be extremely good. But what it does do is we start bringing our people back home.
Yes.
[At this point, several reporters began asking questions at once.]
No, no—go ahead.
Q. Mr. President, the other day——
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Go ahead.
Federal Reserve System/National Economy/China-U.S. Relations 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. The other day, you spoke about the impact—the financial impact, the economic impact—of the coronavirus on our country. Yesterday there was a letter that was sent out publicly by the Federal Reserve Chairman, talking about steps that the Fed may do to prevent economic impacts from happening here in the United States.
The President. Good. It's about time.
Q. What's your reaction? Is that enough—that kind of a letter?
The President. No, I think the Fed has a very important role and especially psychological. I mean, if you look at the—the Fed has a massive impact. Lots of it is psychological, and lots of it is fact.
This is something I think they should have done even beyond this and before this, because other countries—that are not as nearly as prime. We're the greatest in the world. It's our currency. Everything—we have everything. We should have the lowest interest rates. We don't have the lowest interest rates. Our Fed rate is higher.
You look at Germany. You look at Japan. You look at other countries. They have—many of them have negative rates. And we are not put in that position because of our Fed. And now we have this problem. You saw where Germany is lowering and also infusing a lot of money into their economy, a tremendous amount. I haven't heard our Fed say they should do this.
Our Fed should start being a leader, not a follower. Our Fed has been a follower. We need a Fed that's going to be a leader. We should have at least the same rates and ideally lower rates than other countries. We shouldn't be paying more, but we're forced to pay more in interest. And we are the most prime.
Think of it: biggest economy in the world, by far. China would have overtaken us in this year; they were expected to for 5 years—2019, they were going to overtake us. They're not even close, and they won't be close as long as somebody smart is right here, they won't be close. But I will say this: The relationship with them is good, but as far as the Fed is concerned, our Fed should be a leader. Our Fed has not been a leader at all.
Q. [Inaudible]—is a face-to-face meeting with the Fed Chair—yes.
The President. Frankly, we should have—we should have—we could refinance our debt at even lower rates. The rates are very low, but we should be refinancing debt at even lower rates. Our Fed is making us pay more than we should, and that's ridiculous.
Q. Mr. President——
Q. [Inaudible]—question the economy? Another question on the economy.
Coronavirus Treatment Options/Prescription Drug Pricing 
Q. Mr. President, thank you. You mentioned you're having the meeting on Monday with the pharmaceutical executives.
The President. Right.
Q. As you know, the process of approving medicines is complex and time-consuming. What powers——
The President. I think this process will go very quickly.
Q. What powers will you use to speed it up?
The President. I think Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative—this process is going to go very quickly.
Vice President Pence. The head of the FDA is on your right.
The President. And you know, that was—excuse me?
Vice President Pence. The head of the FDA is here, if you want to call on him.
The President. Yes. We can do that. You want to do that?
Vice President Pence. We're expedited.
The President. Okay. Would you like to say something? All right. Okay.
Vice President Pence. Excuse me for interrupting.
Q. And the private companies, too, that you're talking about, doing tests with.
Commissioner of Food and Drugs Stephen M. Hahn. So we are working very diligently with industry. We're using our authorities in an expedited fashion to help with the development of therapeutics, particularly around the coronavirus.
As you probably know, we issued a policy this morning that allows us to have a lot of flexibility around the development of diagnostic tests. Our colleagues at the CDC have done a great job to have an increase in those tests, and we expect this policy to have a significant impact on that as well. Thanks.
Q. Mr. President——
Q. Mr. President, on the economy——
Q. Mr. President—[inaudible]—in the markets?
The President. By the way, the meeting with the pharmaceutical companies was actually set up before, over drug pricing, because we want prices to go way down. But it turns out to be a very convenient meeting as it pertains to the vaccine.
Q. So you'll talk about both?
The President. Talk about both.
Vice President Michael R. Pence's Record as Governor of Indiana/White House Coronavirus Task Force 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You put the Vice President in charge of coronavirus coordination across the Government. When he was Governor of Indiana, the Vice President allowed HIV outbreak to spiral out of control because he did not heed the advice of his public health professional advisers who said the needle exchange was necessary at the beginning of the outbreak.
What guarantee can you give Americans that political considerations and ideological issues will play no role in your Government's response to this virus?
The President. Well, let me just respond quickly, and then I'm going to have Mike say something about that, because I've heard very good explanations, actually.
When it came to health care, Indiana has been a leader, an absolute leader. And it was really started with others, but by Mike Pence, and he's done a phenomenal job on health care. One of the best, if not the best, in the country.
And with that, I'll let Mike respond specifically, if you want to.
Vice President Pence. Sure. Thank you, Mr. President. When I was Governor of the State of Indiana, we actually had two experiences with the spread of infectious diseases. The first was in 2014, when Indiana was where the very first MERS case in the United States arrived. Obviously, an infectious disease much more deadly than the coronavirus that we're dealing with today.
It was then, when I was Governor, that I learned of the extraordinary capabilities of CDC. I worked with my health officials in the State of Indiana. I worked with Federal officials and, maybe most importantly, learned the invaluable role that local health officials play in dealing with the spread of infectious disease.
I'm proud to say that the State of Indiana secured that patient, found out everyone they'd ever contacted. There were no additional infections, and that patient recovered. There was only one other MERS disease.
Q. And the HIV outbreak, sir?
Vice President Pence. The other incident was in 2015. We had a—we had an outbreak of HIV in a very small town that emerged in early 2015. My health officials came to me. We immediately deployed health resources. But the truth was, is HIV/AIDS was being spread by people sharing needles in intravenous drug use, and the State of Indiana did not allow for providing a needle exchange to citizens.
But the CDC came in and made a recommendation. And I declared a public health emergency and made, for 30 days, a needle exchange available in the State of Indiana. And I'm proud to say that every one of those patients was treated. We ended the spread of the HIV/AIDS virus in that community.
Q. Sir——
Vice President Pence. But again, as I've said before, I think, as the President and I have discussed, I think my experience as a Governor, dealing with two different infectious diseases and seeing the vital role that local health care providers play, that Federal officials play, it has really informed me. It's one of the reasons why I've been spending a lot of time talking to Governors. I met yesterday with State health officials and the Governor in Florida. And I'm proud of the work that we did in the State of Indiana, and I hope to continue to bring all of the best minds together to deal with this issue.
Q. So, Mr. Vice President——
Q. Mr. Vice President, it took 2 months——
The President. It was a great answer, and he's doing a great job.
Go ahead. He's doing a great job. Great answer. Thank you.
Turkey-U.S. Trade 
Q. Two days ago, 36 Turkish soldiers were killed in Idlib, Syria. And today, Turkish Foreign——
The President. When was that? When?
Q. Two days ago.
The President. Okay.
Q. And today, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu said Turkey wants Patriot air defense system from the United States. Are you in talk with Turkish Government regarding this topic?
The President. We're speaking to President Erdogan a lot, and we are talking to him about exactly what you're referring to.
Q. Where are you on numbers to Congress?
National Economy/Coronavirus Containment Efforts 
Q. On the markets, are you able to do anything from a policy or reassurance standpoint to try to deal with jitters in the markets?
The President. The market will all come back. The markets are very strong. The consumer is unbelievably strong. The companies are very strong. We have one problem. We have to get this problem brought into focus, and it is right now. I think our professionals are doing a great job. I'm not thinking—I'm not thinking in terms——
Q. But if people stop traveling and if there are supply chain interruptions and things like that?
The President. Well, it's certainly—it's certainly not a good situation when you lose travel. That's a big part of market. But for a period of time, we're going to have to do whatever is necessary. Safety, health, number one. We—the markets will take care of themselves. The companies—companies are very powerful. Our consumer has never been in a better position than they are right now.
Larry Kudlow was telling me before that the numbers—I said: ""Don't even bring it up. What difference?"" But that the numbers are very strong. He's got numbers from Friday, very strong. You see the numbers.
Q. Are there——
Q. [Inaudible]—on Wall Street——
The President. But our focus—our focus is on exactly this; it's not on that. That will take care of itself.
Tax Relief 
Q. Are you considering any tax breaks to help ease the pain? The President. I think the big thing we're looking for is the Fed to do its job. If the Fed does its job, that's what we are really looking for. We're—prior to this, we—as you know, we announced that we're going to be—at the end of the year, we're going to be—toward the end of the year, we're going to be announcing a middle-income tax cut in order to get that through. I don't think the Democrats are going to be approving any tax cuts, because they'd like to raise taxes instead of lower taxes. But we'll be, in the not-too-distant future, announcing a very major middle-income tax cut. Okay?
So, ladies and gentlemen, thank you. Thank you.
Q. Mr. President——
Q. Mr. President——
Q. How can you say the markets are strong——
The President. Go ahead, please.
Coronavirus Prevention Efforts in the U.S. 
Q. People are starting to buy hand sanitizer and food supplies and also medical supplies to prepare.
The President. Yes.
Q. And there is news about some of the items are out of stock. Do you think they should get prepared? And also——
The President. I think it's always good to be prepared. I think it's always good. But we are superprepared, when you hear 43 thousand—43 million masks, as an example.
All right, we'll do one more. Go ahead, the gentleman—go ahead.
Multilateral Arms Control Negotiations/U.S. Nuclear Arsenal 
Q. Thank you very much. It has been reported yesterday that you are willing, at this point, to meet with leaders of Russia, China, the U.K., and France.
The President. Right.
Q. ——to discuss arms control issues among other things.
The President. They all want to discuss arms control, and that's a wise thing. We're spending now over $20 billion on nuclear and on the superspeed missiles and many other things.
And they have come to me, and they all want to now discuss arms control, and that includes China, and that includes Russia. And I think it's very smart of them to want to do it, and I think it's very smart of us to want to do it. And we will be discussing that in New York.
Q. Sir, how can you say that the markets are strong?
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Go ahead. One final question. Go ahead.
Q. Should we be traveling to Washington State?
Q. Thank you. Are you——
The President. No, no. Please.
Q. Should we be traveling to Washington State?
Withdrawal of U.S. Troops From Afghanistan
Q. When do you anticipate troops will be returning? You said—how soon do you see them returning in this U.S.-Taliban agreement? How soon do you expect troops to be coming back?
The President. Like, today. Okay? Today. They'll start immediately.
Q. Mr. President, how can you say that the markets are strong?
The President. So, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be doing this quite often. We're going to keep you abreast of all of the facts.
And again, I want to thank the professionals. They are great professionals. I've gotten to really know them and see them under very interesting and tough and trying conditions. We have the finest in the world.
I will say this: Other countries call us and they ask, would it be possible for them to speak to Anthony and Bob and the people that you're talking to on a daily basis now. So we're going to be very transparent. We'll be meeting you probably tomorrow or the next day. We'll keep you abreast. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Q. Mr. President—[inaudible]—on the numbers to Congress, sir?
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Thank you.
Q. Where are you on the numbers to Congress?
Q. Is traveling to Washington State okay?
Secretary Azar. Yes it is. Yes.
Q. It is?
Q. Traveling to Washington State is okay?
Secretary Azar. Yes. Yes. Dr. Redfield, because you mentioned that, I want to make sure we answer that question.
Q. Thank you. And California. Can we travel to California—to and from California and Washington State?
Q. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.
Director Redfield. I just want to echo again that the risk is low—the risk is low. I encourage Americans to go about their life. That includes travel to California, Oregon, and the State of Washington.
And we will continue to have aggressive public health response with our State and local, Territorial health departments to get a better understanding of these community cases that we've now begun to see."
"April 14, 2020",The President's News Conference,Donald J. Trump,"Donald J. Trump, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/341788",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1240,"The President. Thank you very much. Please. Very importantly, I'd like to begin by saying that we've just reached agreement—the Secretary of Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, with the major airlines, all of our great airlines—to participate in a payroll support program. This agreement will fully support airline industry workers, preserve the vital role airlines play in our economy, and protect taxpayers. Our airlines are now in good shape, and they will get over a very tough period of time that was not caused by them.
The United States is continuing to make substantial progress in our war against the virus. We grieve at every precious life that has been lost to the invisible enemy, but through the darkness, we can see the rays of light. We see that tunnel. And at the end of that tunnel, we see light. We're starting to see it.
More than ever before, we've held our rate, the numbers, the—everything we've done. We've been very, very strong on it and very powerful on it. You look at what's happening in other countries—Spain, Italy, United Kingdom—we're working with them. We're trying to help them, especially with ventilators. They've been calling a lot. They need ventilators so badly.
Fifteen percent of counties within the United States have zero cases, and many counties within the United States have a very small number of cases. Large sections of our country are really looking at other sections and saying, ""Wow, that looks bad."" But they don't have the problem.
I salute the American people for following our guidelines on social distancing—even you people. It's so different looking out there when I look at you. Their devotion, your devotion is saving lives.
And today I'm instructing my administration to halt funding of the World Health Organization while a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organization's role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus. Everybody knows what's going on there.
American taxpayers provide between $400 million and $500 million per year to the WHO. In contrast, China contributes roughly $40 million a year and even less. As the organization's leading sponsor, the United States has a duty to insist on full accountability.
One of the most dangerous and costly decisions from the WHO was its disastrous decision to oppose travel restrictions from China and other nations. They were very much opposed to what we did. Fortunately, I was not convinced and suspended travel from China, saving untold numbers of lives. Thousands and thousands of people would have died.
Had other nations likewise suspended travel from China, countless more lives would have been saved. Instead, look at the rest of the world. Look at parts of Europe. Other nations and regions, who followed WHO guidelines and kept their borders open to China, accelerated the pandemic all around the world. Many countries said, ""We're going to listen to the WHO,"" and they have problems the likes of which they cannot believe. Nobody can believe.
The decision of other major countries to keep travel open was one of the great tragedies and missed opportunities from the early days. The WHO's attack on travel restrictions put political correctness above lifesaving measures. Travel bans work for the same reason that quarantines work. Pandemics depend on human-to-human transmission. Border control is fundamental to virus control.
Since its establishment in 1948, the American people have generously supported the World Health Organization to provide better health outcomes for the world and, most importantly, to help prevent global health crises. With the outbreak of the COVID–19 pandemic, we have deep concerns whether America's generosity has been put to the best use possible.
The reality is that the WHO failed to adequately obtain that and share information in a timely and transparent fashion. The world depends on the WHO to work with countries to ensure that accurate information about international health threats is shared in a timely manner, and if it's not, to independently to tell the world the truth about what is happening.
The WHO failed in this basic duty and must be held accountable. It's time, after all of these decades. The WHO failed to investigate credible reports from sources in Wuhan that conflicted directly with the Chinese Government's official accounts. There was credible information to suspect human-to-human transmission in December 2019, which should have spurred the WHO to investigate and investigate immediately.
Through the middle of January, it parroted and publicly endorsed the idea that there was not human-to-human transmission happening despite reports and clear evidence to the contrary. The delays the WHO experienced in declaring a public health emergency caused valuable time, tremendous amounts of time. More time was lost in the delay it took to get a team of international experts in to examine the outbreak, which we wanted to do, which they should have done. The inability of the WHO to obtain virus samples, to this date, has deprived the scientific community of essential data.
New data that emerges across the world on a daily basis points to the unreliability of the initial reports. And the world received all sorts of false information about transmission and mortality.
The silence of the WHO on the disappearance of scientific researchers and doctors and on new restrictions on the sharing of research into the origins of COVID–19 in the country of origin is deeply concerning, especially when we put up, by far, the largest amount of money. Not even close.
Had the WHO done its job to get medical experts into China to objectively assess the situation on the ground and to call out China's lack of transparency, the outbreak could have been contained at its source, with very little death—very little death—and certainly very little death by comparison. This would have saved thousands of lives and avoided worldwide economic damage.
Instead, the WHO willingly took China's assurances to face value, and they took it just at face value and defended the actions of the Chinese Government, even praising China for its so- called transparency. I don't think so. The WHO pushed China's misinformation about the virus, saying it was not communicable and there was no need for travel bans. They told us, when we put on our travel ban—a very strong travel ban—there was no need to do it. ""Don't do it."" They actually fought us. The WHO's reliance on China's disclosures likely caused a 20-fold increase in cases worldwide, and it may be much more than that.
The WHO has not addressed a single one of these concerns nor provided a serious explanation that acknowledges its own mistakes, of which there were many. America and the world have chosen to rely on the WHO for accurate, timely, and independent information to make important public health recommendations and decisions. If we cannot trust that this is what we will receive from the WHO, our country will be forced to find other ways to work with other nations to achieve public health goals. We'll have no choice but to do that.
Our countries are now experiencing—you look all over the world—tremendous death and economic devastation because those tasked with protecting us by being truthful and transparent failed to do so. It would have been so easy to be truthful. And so much death has been caused by their mistakes.
We will continue to engage with the WHO to see if it can make meaningful reforms. For the time being, we will redirect global health and directly work with others. All of the aid that we send will be discussed at very, very powerful letters and with very powerful and influential groups and smart groups, medically, politically, and every other way.
And we'll be discussing it with other countries and global health partners: what do we do with all of that money that goes to WHO. And maybe WHO will reform, and maybe they won't. But we'll be able to see.
As you know, in other countries hit hard by the virus, hospitals have been tragically forced to ration medical care and the use of ventilators. But due to our early and aggressive action, the skill of our health care workers, and the resilience of our health care system, no hospital in America has been forced to deny any patient access to a ventilator—with all of the talk you've heard, where some States wanted 40,000 ventilators. I said, ""That doesn't work,"" 40,000. And they ended up with 7- or 8,000, and they had no problem. Forty thousand ventilators for one State. It was ridiculous.
The scariest day of my life was about a month ago when, after a long day of meetings, my team told me that we were going to be needing 130,000 ventilators; that we were short hundreds of thousands of ventilators. This is the system we inherited. I had Governors requesting unreasonable sums that the Federal Government just didn't have.
And you look at the States. The States didn't have—the States were not prepared. I knew that every person who needed a ventilator and didn't get one would die. And that's what we were told: They would die. I saw another country's doctors having to make decisions on who got a ventilator and who didn't. And I knew that this would be a defining challenge of the crisis. Those that didn't get ventilators were said to be in a position only of one alternative, and that was death. Would we be able to prevent Americans from dying because we couldn't get them ventilators and the ventilators that they needed and they needed immediately? I instructed my team to move Heaven and Earth to make sure that this didn't happen.
We started to smartly ration and distribute the ventilators that we had and that others had. And I got daily updates on the supply we had from requests coming in and people wanting to have updates. We had a great group of people working on it.
I instructed my team to use the Defense Production Act. And the Defense Production Act was used very powerfully—more powerfully than anybody would know. In fact, so powerfully that, for the most part, we didn't have to officially take it out—it was a hammer; it was a very powerful hammer—in order to manufacture as many ventilators as possible.
Last year, America manufactured, from a dead start, 30,000 ventilators. And this year, the number will be over 150,000 ventilators. It could be as high as 200,000, far more than we'll ever need. So we'll be able to stockpile. We'll be able to talk to States about stockpiling.
These are high-quality ventilators. We had a choice: We could do inexpensive, less productive ventilators or high-quality. We've done a high-quality ventilator.
So we should have anywhere from 150- to 200,000 ventilators. In addition to that, we have 10,000 ventilators right now in the Federal stockpile ready to move should we need them—we might not—should we need them in New York or New Jersey or in Louisiana or in Illinois or any other State that may need them if we have a surge.
I'd like to ask Adam Boehler to come up and just say a few words. He's done a fantastic job, a young man who worked 24 hours a day on handling this situation. And I'd just like to have— have Adam, wherever he may be, come up and say a few words.
Adam, please. Thank you very much.
U.S. International Development Finance Corporation Chief Executive Officer Adam S. Boehler. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. At your direction, this country has worked hard over the past few weeks to ramp up ventilator production through all means possible. Thousands of ventilators are coming in now monthly, with over 100,000 by the end of June.
[Mr. Boehler continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
These have been difficult times. A few weeks ago, the Vice President came into my office, and he reminded us of the power of the resilience of the American people and of private companies. We needed it that day, Mr. Vice President. This partnership is another example of Americans helping Americans. Thank you.
The President. Thank you very much. Fantastic job.
Mr. Boehler. Thank you, sir.
The President. I'd shake his hand, but I'm not allowed to. Times have changed, haven't they?
Thank you very much. You did a fantastic job. We're very proud of you—you and your whole team. Thank you.
Today we are taking further action to maximize our oversupply and available ventilators. This afternoon I met with the leaders—the top people—of many of America's big, powerful, beautiful, and you know, very, very important hospitals and hospital associations who join us today. We had a great meeting, learned a lot. And they've been going through a lot and they've been doing a fantastic job, as everybody here will attest.
I'm pleased to announce that my administration is partnering with the hospitals across the country to create an innovative new system called the Dynamic Ventilator Reserve so that we're going to have tremendous numbers of ventilators that we're able to help our States with at a later date if there's ever a problem like this, which we hope to God will never happen again. It was 1917, 1918. That's a long time ago. We hope it never happens again.
And I'd like to ask Rick Pollack, CEO of American Hospital Association; Sam Hazen, CEO of HCA Healthcare—that's the largest in the United States; Warner Thomas, CEO of Ochsner Health. And if I could, Mihal—you—are you here from Cleveland Clinic? Somebody? Good.
Thank you. Come on up, folks. Please.
Thank you. Say a few words please.
American Hospital Association Chief Executive Officer and President Richard J. Pollack. Thank you very much, Mr. President. We appreciate the opportunity to work with you and your team on the Dynamic Ventilator Reserve program. This will provide a really important mechanism for us in serving our patients and communities by ensuring that this vital equipment will be available to critical areas that are in need.
[Mr. Pollack continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
We appreciate the work of the administration in helping us find innovative solutions to ensure the best care for our patients. We'll continue to work with hospitals and health systems across the country to add to this reserve further. Your team has provided us with important leadership, and we look forward to working with you in making this a success.
Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Thank you very much.
HCA Management Services, L.P., Chief Executive Officer Samuel N. Hazen. Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Adam, the team. I stand here before you, in front of our 285,000 colleagues who provide care to patients every day across the country.
One of the guiding principles we had when we went into this COVID–19 battle was to find partnerships: partnerships with other components of the industry, partnerships with other health systems, but partnerships with governments, both local and Federal. And we're proud to be a part of this private-public sector partnership, and I think it's going to do great good for the community.
So thank you very much.
The President. Great job. Thank you.
Ochsner Health Chief Executive Officer and President Warren L. Thomas. Thank you, Mr. President. It's great to have Ochsner Health be part of this program. We certainly have been a recipient, and the State of Louisiana has been a recipient, of help getting ventilators to our State and to Ochsner Health.
We're currently taking care of about 60 percent of the COVID patients in New Orleans, and we did see a spike over the past few weeks. But we're starting to get on the other side of that and heading in the right direction.
I also want to thank you personally for helping Ochsner Health a couple weeks ago. We were running short on surgical gowns, and you and your team were able to direct some to New Orleans, which was helpful to us and other hospitals around the New Orleans area.
So we're excited to be part of this Dynamic Ventilator Reserve, and we are proud to be part of that and help other communities around the country. Thank you.
The President. Thank you very much.
Cleveland Clinic Chief Executive Officer and President Tomislav Mihaljevic. Thank you, Mr. President, for the invitation here. On behalf of the Cleveland Clinic, I would just like to offer a slightly different story about a COVID pandemic.
In our home State of Ohio, with an early institution of social distancing, our ability to scale up the testing and ramping out the capacity, we have actually seen a stable number of patients over the last 8 to 10 days. Only 160 patients have been hospitalized with COVID infection in Cleveland Clinic Health System.
We're also very grateful for the support from our State government, as well from our Federal Government. This is a battle where we're all in together. We coordinate our efforts, share our resources, and work together as one. I'm firmly convinced that we can do a lot of good when we work together. Thank you very much for having us.
The President. Thank you very much. Great job.
Dr. Mihaljevic. Thank you, sir.
The President. Thank you all. Great job.
That was a terrific meeting. And thank you all for being here. Thank you very much. The United States has far more ICU beds per capita than any other nation. We have 34.7 ICU beds per 100,000 people, which is the best there is, compared with roughly 12.5 beds per 100,000 in Italy, 11.6 beds in France, 9.7 beds in Spain. Think of that—34.7, we have—and 6.6 the U.K. There are more than 60,000 ventilators at hospitals and other health care facilities that are not in use at this moment. They didn't need them. We got a lot of them out, and they didn't need them. And that's a good thing that they didn't need them.
But a lot of good brainpower was involved in making a lot of fantastic decisions. I want to thank our Vice President for the Task Force. And I want to thank all members of your Task Force on having done an incredible job. You really have done an incredible job. Thank you, Mike, very much.
Through this new partnership with the hospitals, unused ventilators will voluntarily lend them. Where they have unused ventilators, they will voluntarily lend those ventilators to other hospitals and other areas of greater need.
Within the last several days, more than 20 of our Nation's largest health systems have already pledged more than 4,000 ventilators should we need them. And I've been told that if they need more, there are more there. We're going to be helping very soon when the supply really starts pouring in, which is—which started, but will really start about less than a month.
We're going to be helping other countries, and they need it very badly. They have no chance without these ventilators. They have to have ventilators.
As we continue our medical war against the virus, the FDA has now authorized the first test developed by researchers from Rutgers University that can use saliva from patients. It's the first one. These tests can be self-administered by patients in health care settings, which will reduce exposure for medical workers and save personal protective equipment. Rutgers will begin processing 10,000 tests daily.
So by using saliva—that's a first—they'll be able to do things, in terms of speed and ease, that we haven't been able to do before. So a lot of great innovation is taking place during this period of time. And that's innovation. I call it ""innovation under pressure."" There's a big difference. ""Innovation under pressure."" Right? Cleveland Clinic knows all about that.
As we prepare for the next phase of this great struggle, we must also do everything in our power to restore prosperity for the American worker. There's tremendous interest and excitement surrounding the administration's efforts to get the economy roaring once again, and I think it's going to roar once it gets open. I think it's going to go up tremendously.
You see what's happening with the stock market already, because a lot of the very smart financial people—the great minds—they're looking at the stock, and they're saying, ""Wow."" Because they really—what they're really seeing is how we're doing. If we weren't doing well, the market wouldn't be at a level that it is today. They have a lot of confidence that we're doing the right thing and that our country is going to be open soon and our country is going to be booming.
We've had requests to participate from the best in the world as we share their enthusiasm to get our country going. So I thank them for wanting to contribute. And we look forward to speaking with many industry leaders, seeking their input on how we can return to what was, until very recently, the greatest economy anywhere in the world and, I can say, the greatest economy in the history of the world. There's never been an economy like we had.
Just a little bit more than a month ago, we set every record you could set: more people working than we've ever had working before—almost 160 million; the best unemployment numbers we've ever had; and the best employment numbers we've ever had. Everybody was doing well. Stock market at a record—142 days it hit a record. And I think we're going to top those records, okay? And I think we're going to top them soon, once we get rid of the invisible enemy, which will happen.
The plans to reopen the country are close to being finalized, and we will soon be sharing details and new guidelines with everybody. I will be speaking to all 50 Governors very shortly.
And I will then be authorizing each individual Governor, of each individual State, to implement a reopening and a very powerful reopening plan of their State at a time and in a manner as most appropriate.
The day will be very close because certain States, as you know, are in much different condition and in a much different place than other States. It's going to be very, very close, maybe even before the date of May 1. So that will be for some States. Actually, there are over 20 that are in extremely good shape. And we think we're going to be able to get them open fairly quickly, and then others will follow.
The Federal Government will be watching them very closely, and we'll be there to help.
We'll be there to help in many different ways, as we've been—where we built hospital beds at a number that nobody has ever seen before, where we did the ventilators that we just discussed at a level that nobody has ever seen before. Nobody can even believe.
Other foreign countries—even powerful countries—can't believe what we were able to do with ventilators. Big, powerful countries. Big producing countries can't believe what we were able to do. We will hold the Governors accountable. But again, we're going to be working with them to make sure it works really well.
Now, we have a list of people that I'll be speaking to over the next very short period of time—in many cases, tomorrow. We're going to have elected officials, and we'll be submitting that list to you within the next 24 hours. But we have a list of different industries that I'll be discussing by—meeting by telephone, because we don't want people traveling right now: the American Farm Bureau Federation—Zippy Duvall; Cisco Systems, Tyson Foods, Perdue Farms, Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland Company, Corteva, Tractor Supply Company, Seaboard Corporation, Grimmway Farms, Mountaire Farms, and others in the agricultural business.
In banking, it's: Bank of America—Brian Moynihan has been great; JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon; Goldman Sachs; Citigroup; Wells Fargo; U.S. Bancorp; Morgan Stanley, James Gorman; Grand Rapids State Bank; Southern Bancorp—all great institutions with lots to say and lots of good ideas.
And if you look at how Paycheck has been working out, the numbers are incredible. And I hope Congress is going to be able to supplement the amount of money going to our workers. I hope they're able to get that done very quickly because it's been an incredible success, and many are already spending that money, and the money has been distributed at numbers that nobody believed possible for this short period of time. It was only a week ago. But a lot of money has been distributed already. It's going to keep our small businesses open.
The construction labor workforce: International Union of Operating Engineers, Jim Callahan; North America Building Trades Union, Sean McGarvey. These are a lot of friends of mine. The Laborers' International Union of North America, Terry O'Sullivan; International Brotherhood of Teamsters, James Hoffa; National Electrical Contractors Association, David Long; Bechtel; Fluor; National Association of Homebuilders; Association of Builders and Contractors; Associated General Contractors; Richard Trumka, AF of L–CIO; G.H. Palmer. So these are some of the unions, pretty much almost all of the ones that will be on the line.
In defense, we have: Lockheed Martin, Honeywell, Northrop Grumman. These are all the top of each company—CEOs, chairmans, presidents. Raytheon, General Dynamics. Energy—we had a tremendous success recently with energy over the weekend. It finished with tremendous credit going to Russia and Saudi Arabia. And it could be as much as 20 million barrels a day are cut so that we can get rid of some of the tremendous excess oil that's been produced because of the fact that the virus just knocked out almost 50 percent of the business. It's been an amazing achievement. Some people say one of the biggest oil deals ever made. Maybe the biggest oil deal ever made, they're saying. I didn't know that.
But we were involved in getting that done, and it was very important. We're going to save hundreds of thousands of jobs for our energy industry—Texas and North Dakota, Oklahoma, all of our different energy States. It's great. So we're very happy about it. I want to thank everybody. We had the—it's called OPEC Plus. That's OPEC Plus, meaning some nations outside of OPEC.
And I also want to thank the President of Mexico because he was terrific. He showed great dexterity and flexibility in getting the deal done. I want to thank him very much.
On the energy front, we had: Exxon Mobil, Continental Resources, Chevron, Southern Company, Alabama Power, ConocoPhillips, Occidental Petroleum, Kinder Morgan, Hess Corporation, Pearl Group, and a few others. Big ones. Great ones.
Financial services, we have: Blackstone, Stephen Schwarzman; Paulson & Company, John Paulson; Citadel, Ken Griffin; Elliott Management, Paul Singer; Vista Equity Partners, Robert Smith; Fidelity Investments, Abigail Johnson; MasterCard; Visa; Chubb; Sequoia; Stephens, Warren Stephens—great; Charles Schwab, Chuck Schwab, who will be here by phone.
Food and beverage: National Restaurant Association; McDonald's; Darden Restaurants; Coca-Cola; Pepsi Cola; Chick-fil-A; Subway; Bloomin' Brands; Yum! Brands; Papa John's; Wendy's; Waffle House; Starbucks; Wolfgang Puck; Thomas Keller; Jean-Georges, my friend Jean-Georges; and Daniele. You know them.
From the transportation world: FedEx, Fred Smith; Allegiant; United Airlines, Oscar Munoz; UPS, David Abney; J.B. Hunt; YRC Worldwide; Crowley Maritime—incredible, big, powerful shippers and transportation companies.
In telecommunications, we have: the legendary John Malone of Liberty Media; Verizon; T- Mobile; Charter Communications; and Brian Roberts of Comcast. Thank you all very much.
Health care: New York Presbyterian, Jerry Speyer—a friend of mine; HCA Healthcare, Sam Hazen. Thank you, Sam. Just met with Sam. Ascension Health, CommonSpirit Health, Community Health Systems, Trinity Health, Cardinal Health, McKesson, 3M. Thank you, Mike Roman, for helping us with face masks. It worked out well for everybody. Procter and Gamble, Abbott Laboratories, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Pfizer, Eli Lilly, Thermo Fisher Scientific— they've been helping us incredibly with testing. Gilead Sciences, AbbVie, Regeneron, Biogen, Roche—and Roche has been fantastic on testing, the job they've done. I have to call them out.
They have really—they have stepped up like very few. Anthem; United Health Group; Aetna; Cigna; and Humana—all the big ones.
The tech companies—we have the right ones: Apple, we have Tim Cook; Google, Sundar. Thank you, Sundar; Oracle, Larry Ellison and Safra Catz; Salesforce, Marc Benioff; SAP—SAP, Jen Morgan; Microsoft, Satya—great job he's done. Thank you, Satya. Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg; IBM; Intel; Qualcomm; Cisco; Advanced Micro Devices; Broadcom. Incredible companies. Companies that no other country will catch, if they're smart. They have to be smart.
But I've dealt with a lot of different countries, and I will say that no—the respect for Silicon Valley and our tech companies—there's nobody even close to our tech companies. They can't catch them. So they try and buy them, but we sort of put an end to a lot of that.
In sports—we want to get our sports back, so importantly. These will be some separate calls.
Some will be together, by the way—lists—and some will be separate. But we have to get our sports back. I'm tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old. But I haven't actually had too much time to watch. I would say maybe I watch one batter, and then I get back to work.
The NBA, Adam Silver; the Major League Baseball—we miss our baseball—well, this is baseball season right here. Rob Manfred, thank you very much. NFL—Roger Goodell. Thank you, Roger. UFC, Dana White. Great Dana White. PGA, Jay Monahan; LPGA, Michael Whan; USDA, Patrick Galbraith. Major League Soccer, Don Garber; WWE, the great Vince McMahon; NASCAR, Lesa Kennedy. Thank you, Lesa. NHL, Gary Bettman; from the New England Patriots, Bob Kraft; Dallas Cowboys, Jerry Jones; Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban.
And some of the thought leaders that we're going to have—and there's some others that we are having; we're just waiting to hear. But everybody's saying yes, I must say. John Allison; Heritage Foundation, Kay Coles James—great person. Hoover Institute, Condoleezza Rice— another great person. Art Laffer; Steve Moore; Steve Forbes; Larry Lindsey; Catherine Reynolds; Scott Gottlieb—just spoke with Scott; Jim DeMint—","and Jim has been a terrific friend; Bill Hagerty; and Ray Washburne.
And religious leaders will be coming on Friday. We'll be speaking to—and we're going to have a separate list, but we have tremendous enthusiasm to meet by our great religious leaders. We have incredible people, and they want to—they want to be a part. And we'll be talking about churches, and we'll be talking about opening. And we'll be talking about things that are very important to a lot of people, including me. We're going to find out how we're doing in that regard.
So those are the names that we have on our list. They're the names that are, I think, the best and the smartest, the brightest. And they're going to give us some ideas. But we're all set, as I said. The Governors are going to be opening up their States. They're going to declare when— they're going to know when. Some can open very, very shortly, if not almost immediately. We'll give a date. But the date is going to be in the very near future.
So we'll get it open. Individual Sates will—and the Governors will be held accountable. If they need things, we'll help them get those things, but we want them to do their testing. We want them—because they're equipped to do testing. We've created incredible tests, and we've done more testing than anybody has ever done in the world right now. And we had a broken system, and now we have a great system. We have a system where other countries are coming to us and saying, ""We want to get some of those tests.""
I want to thank Abbott, because Abbott came up with the first simpler tests. The first one was rough. If you were—I think it was more of an operation than a test. [Laughter] The first one was—for anybody that took it, it was not easy. But now we have a very simple test with Abbott. Now we have saliva; we have lots of other things that are happening. But we have millions of tests.
The Governors are responsible. They have to take charge. They have to do a great job. And we're going to suggest that they check people, through tests or otherwise, coming into their States, and they run their States very strong. Eventually, we won't have to do that. Eventually, this will be gone. But for a while, we're going to do it. So they're going to take charge—at their borders, they're going to take charge of people coming in. And maybe, to an extent, depending on what they work out with their nearby State, it may be also people leaving. And they'll be able to do that very shortly.
We'll be announcing a date, but it will be very short. And frankly, it will be at a time that will be earlier than the deadline that we imposed—the end of April. So we think that some of the Governors will be in really good shape to open up even sooner than that. We'll speak to them. But we're all set and we're counting on the Governors to do a great job.
Others are going to have to take a longer period of time until they're in a position to say, ""We're ready to go."" And that's okay. We understand that. Some of the Governors have a very tough situation. But in almost all cases, it's all starting to come down. We're very proud of the job everybody has done.
And if you look at the numbers—so the minimum, as you—as portrayed—Deborah is here.
Dr. Birx has been fantastic. The minimum was 100,000 deaths. And I hope to be substantially under the minimum, meaning we all hope—Mike, right?—we all hope to be substantially under.
We did the right thing, because otherwise, it would have been—the projections are 2 million people. The actual projection was 2.2 million people. And if you cut it in half, that would be 1.1 million people. That's many more. That's double the Civil War. And if you cut that in half, you're talking 5- or 600,000 people. That's what we lost in the Civil War. And that's cutting it, cutting it, cutting it. And we're not going to—that would not be acceptable. It would not be acceptable.
Nothing is—one life isn't acceptable, but we weren't given that option.
So I'm confident that these respected people that I just read from the list will give us some great ideas, in addition to what the Governors have learned. The Governors have learned a lot. I've spoken to Governors that, at the beginning, it was a contentious relationship, and now it's a very friendly relationship and a really great relationship. And I'm proud to say that some of them, I think, are friends. In some cases, they're Democrats, but I think they like me, and I actually like them. I'll tell you who they are someday.
But we're all getting along, and we all want to do the right thing. And I think they're going to do a great job of leading their individual States. It will be a beautiful thing to watch. They'll go and rely on their mayors and their local town officials. They'll bring it right down.
And Washington shouldn't be doing that. We can't be thinking about a Walmart parking lot that's 2,000 miles away where we're doing testing, but a Governor of a State can, and a mayor can, and right down the line. So it's going to be—I think it's going to be a terrific system. And if we're unhappy with the State, we're going to let them know we're unhappy. And if they're not doing the job and they can't get the job done and, for some reason, things are happening that we're not going to like—like the numbers are heading in a wrong direction—we'll have to do something that's very serious. We'll have to, maybe, close them up and start all over again. But I don't think we're going to have to do that.
I think the Governors are going to come out at a time that—and these will be individual dates. And the Governors are going to come out at a time when they're ready. Some can come out very, very shortly. And we look forward to watching that process. I think it's going to be a very beautiful process.
Our discussions will focus with the people that we're dealing with on rejuvenating the economy, and always health. Always health. Health and life. Living is number one. But the rejuvenated economy—and I think it's going to go quickly.
We'll be utilizing our robust testing capacity for the Governors. We'll be giving them what they need, if they don't have it themselves. We hope, by now, they'll be able to have it themselves. We were hoping they would have had it themselves early on, but they weren't. But such great advances have been made. So we'll be dealing with them on that.
And we—they can rely on us very strongly. They're going to be relying on us, I think, for some help. And we're there—whether it's building hospital beds, which I don't think they're going to need. You look at Javits Center—a great, great job that the Army Corps of Engineers did; FEMA got involved. We actually ended up sending our medical people. That was not a COVID– 19 center, and they asked, ""Could you do that?""
And then, even after we did that, it was not used very much, meaning they didn't have to use it nearly to the extent that they thought when they conceived it. It wasn't that they made a mistake; nobody made a mistake. We built it—I'd rather have too much than too little, err on the side of caution. And it's really incredible what they did, including the two ships, the two great ships.
And I just want to thank a lot of really great people, a lot of great politicians. And, again, we're going to be announcing the political list tomorrow. And on there, we're going to have a lot of Senators.
And we're going to be having a meeting with the Governors probably on Thursday, a meeting by teleconference. And a lot of things will be discussed, and some of the details will be discussed. But we want them to do an incredible job of running their States. I think they'll do an incredible job too. After having gotten to know so many of them, I think each one of them will do an incredible job.
And, again, the Federal Government is there. We have ventilators if they need them. We have beds if they need them. We have hospitals if they need them. We have a testing capacity that's now second to none. We're—again, other countries are calling us. Countries that you thought were doing well are calling us for help on testing. So we're there to help.
And, with that, if you have a few questions, we'll take them. And if not, that would be okay too.
Yes, go ahead please. Jeff [Jeff Mason, Reuters].
World Health Organization
Q. Mr. President, two questions. First, on your announcement about the WHO, I understand your grievances with them.
The President. Yes.
Q. But can you address why it is the correct time to do this now in the middle of a pandemic?
The President. Well, we're going to be dealing with countries, and we're going to be dealing with leaders of different parts of the world. We spend $500 million a year. We have for many years—more, far more, than anybody else, including China.
And I mean, look, I read off a long list of problems that we have. And we've had problems with them for years. It doesn't matter—we're looking at a term of 60 to 90 days. We're doing a very thorough investigation right now as we speak. But this should have been done by previous administrations a long time ago. And when you look at the mistakes that were made—all of the mistakes that were made—it's just something we have to look at.
And it is very China-centric. I told that to President Xi. I said, ""The World Health Organization is very China-centric."" Meaning, whatever it is, China was always right. You can't do that. You can't do that. Not right. And we spend—and again, it's not a question of money. But when we're spending $500 million and China is spending $38 million, $34 million, $40 million—$42 million, in a case. It's—again, not money, but it's not right.
So we'll see. This is an evaluation period. But in the meantime, we're putting a hold on all funds going to World Health. We will be able to take that money and channel it to the areas that most need it. And that's another way of doing it, but we have not been treated properly.
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Yes, please.
Federal Assistance to States/Availability of Medical Supplies and Equipment
Q. Mr. President, you mentioned that you're going to be speaking with the—all the Governors tomorrow——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——make recommendations——
The President. On probably Thursday.
Q. On Thursday. What if they don't listen to you or take your advice or obey you?
The President. Well, listen——
Q. Will you——
The President. All right.
Q. Will you consider taking away their Federal funding?
The President. I don't want to say that. They'll listen. They'll be fine. I think we're going to have a good relationship. They need the Federal Government not only for funding—and I'm not saying take it away—but they need it for advice. They'll need, maybe, equipment that we have. We have a tremendous stockpile that we're in the process of completing. We're in a very good position.
Again, the cupboard was bare when I got here. Nobody ever thought a thing—in all fairness to previous administrations, nobody ever thought anything like this was going to happen, but it did happen.
No, the Governors will be very, very respectful of the Presidency. Again, this isn't me; this is the Presidency. The Presidency has such a great importance, in terms of what we're doing. And you can talk about Constitution, you can talk about federalism, you can talk about whatever you want, but the best way—I'm talking now from a managerial standpoint—is to let individual Governors run individual States and come to us if they have difficulty and we will help them.
Yes, John [John Roberts, Fox News].
Coronavirus Testing Access/Resumption of Economic and Commercial Activity
Q. Mr. President, you talked about having testing and tracing equipment and the facility for that in place to open up the Government. Dr. Fauci said this morning that that critical testing and tracing ability does not currently exist.
The President. Well, I don't know—look, I don't know.
Q. Will—will—will it——
The President. Hey, John, I don't know what he said.
Q. My question is: Will it——
The President. Nobody knows.
Q. My question is: Will it exist by May 1?
The President. The individual Governors have testing. The individual Governors—we have many forms of testing, and new testing is being developed.
Our country has to get open, and it will get open, and it will get open safely and, hopefully, quickly, some areas quicker than other areas. But there is tremendous testing and the Governors will use whatever testing is necessary. And if they're not satisfied with their testing, they shouldn't open. But they'll use whatever is testing—whatever testing is necessary.
Go ahead. Please.
World Health Organization/World Trade Organization
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Back to the WHO, will you support the organization again, if Tedros is immediately replaced? Or do you want to see him step down as a possible reform?
The President. Well, we're doing an investigation. I don't know the gentleman, but I know there have been problems. And it's been very unfair to the United States, just like the World Trade Organization has been very, very unfair, and now they're coming into line. When they consider China a developing nation, and because China is a developing nation, they take massive advantage of the United States? Why didn't other Presidents stop this? I've been talking about it from the day I got in, and we're looking at that very, very strongly. World Trade—W—so I have a problem with World Health and World Trade, both of them. I'm not sure which is worse, if you want to know the truth, but we'll figure it out. Okay?
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Go ahead, please.
China-U.S. Trade Agreement
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You were just criticizing the WHO for praising China as transparent, but you were saying many of the same things about China just a couple of months ago. So, I mean, how do you square, your decision to revoke funding—[inaudible]?
The President. Well, I did a trade deal with China, where China is supposed to be spending $250 billion in our country. We're going to be watching very much to see. Now, it got a little bit waylaid by the virus.
But look, I'd love to have a good relationship with China. But if you look—and we made a phenomenal deal. China has paid—because of me, China has paid us tens of billions of dollars over the course of a very short period of time. Billions of—some of that money has been spent to farmers, where they were targeted by China. We cannot let that happen. We can't let that happen.
So we ended up signing a very good trade deal. Now, I want to see if China lives up to it. I know President Xi; I think he will live up to it. If he doesn't live up to it, that will be okay too, because we have very, very good alternatives.
Coronavirus Testing Access
Q. I was talking about the WHO—[inaudible]—Mr. President.
The President. Go ahead.
Q. Yes, thank you. Today: 600,000 cases, 25,000 deaths. I know you want to bring—blame the WHO, but I've spoken to hundreds of people across the country in the last few weeks who say they still can't get tested and that they aren't social distancing, because they saw——
The President. So the Governors——
Q. Wait—wait a minute. Let me finish.
The President. Yes. Yes. Yes.
Q. So they aren't——
The President. Excuse me. Excuse me. I know—I know your question. You ready?
Q. Well, no, you don't. No——
The President. The Governors—the Governors are supposed to do testing. It's up to the Governors.
Go ahead please.
Q. That's not the question. Wait a minute, Mr. President. That's not the question.
The President. Go ahead please.
Q. Mr. President, if we could just—if we could just get back May 1——
Q. The question——
The President. Quiet.
Q. The question was——
The President. Quiet.
Q. The question, Mr. President——
The President. Quiet.
Q. The question is——
Q. If we could just get back to May 1. Mr. President, how many——
Q.——they say that they are not—that they are following your lead, that they are not social distancing.
The President. The Governors are doing the testing. It's now not up—and it hasn't been up— to the Federal Government.
Go ahead.
Q. That's not what I'm asking. The question is about social distancing, sir.
Q. Mr. President, I have a quick follow on the WHO, but if May 1——
Q. The question is if——
The President. I told them when they put this guy here, it's nothing but trouble. He's a showboat.
Q. I'm just trying to ask you a question.
The President. If you keep talking, I'll leave——
Q. I'm just trying to ask a question.
The President. ——and you can have it out with the rest of these people.
Q. I'm just trying to ask a question. I'm just——
The President. If you keep talking, I'm going to leave, and you can have it out with them.
Q. It's a simple question.
The President. Just a loudmouth. Go ahead.
Resumption of Economic and Commercial Activity/Coronavirus Testing Access/Availability of Medical Supplies and Equipment
Q. If you could kind of clarify: Are you basically lifting your ""Slow the Spread"" before the——
The President. No.
Q. ——May 1 deadline?
The President. No.
Q. And then——
The President. I'm not at all. No.
Q. And then—and then how many States——
The President. The Governors are going to be running their individual States. Some of them will say, ""No, I can't open now."" And some of them may last longer than we even would think. Others will say, ""I can.""
You can go—I don't want to mention States, but there are numerous States that are in great shape right now. They're viewing the rest of the country like we don't even believe this is happening. We have a lot of those States. They're set to open, practically, now. I mean, they would be open now. We're going to let them open sooner than the date. We're going to pick a date. We're going to get a date that's good. But it's going to be very, very soon, sooner than the end of the month.
But there are many States out there that are looking at this, and they're reviewing it, and they're saying, ""We shouldn't be even included in this."" You know, there are some that want to open up almost now.
Now, if we disagree with it, we're not going to let them open. We're not going to let them open. If some Governor said—you know, has a lot of problems, a lot of cases, a lot of death, and they want to open early, we're not going to let it happen. So we're there to watch. We're there to help. But we're also there to be critics.
And on testing—very important—we've always wanted the States to do the testing. We're now providing great testing, but the State has to provide the great testing. The State has to provide the ventilators, but they didn't do that. So we ended up going into the ventilator business, essentially, and we made tens of thousands of ventilators and we solved a big problem for the States. But we want them to do the testing, and we are there to help.
Yes, please.
China-U.S. Trade/World Health Organization/Restrictions on Travel From China to the U.S.
Q. I have two questions. Or I have a question on the Governors——
The President. One question. Just one.
Q. Well, I have a question on the Governors. But first, can I follow up Jordan's [Jordan Fabian, the Hill]——
The President. One question. Go ahead.
Q. Can I follow-up on Jordan's question?
The President. Go ahead.
Q. Do you want to walk back where you did praise China in January for being transparent about the coronavirus?
The President. I'm always respectful of China.
Q. But——
The President. I'm respectful of other countries. Why wouldn't I be respectful of China? In the meantime, China has paid us nothing in your last administration, nothing in any previous administration.
They paid us tens of billions of dollars because of what we've done. And the trade deal we have, they have to give us $250 billion in purchases. Let's see if they do that. And they're also paying us 25 percent on $250 billion in tariffs. So we're taking in—wait a minute. We're taking in billions of dollars for China—from China. They never paid us 10 cents. That's a great thing.
Now, if they don't produce, or if we find out bad things, we're not going to be happy. But right now—and we're doing that. That's what we're doing.
Look, we have an investigation underway. We're paying almost $500 million. We have an investigation underway on the World Health Organization. We will find out exactly what went on. And we may be satisfied that it can be remedied, and we may be satisfied that it's so bad that it can't be remedied. And if it can't, we're going to go a different route.
Q. But that's not my question. You're criticizing the WHO for praising China for being transparent, but you also praised China for being transparent in January.
The President. I don't talk about China's transparency.
Q. In January, there was a tweet.
The President. Well, you know, if I'm so good to China, how come I was the only person— the only leader of a country—that closed our borders tightly against China?
Q. I'm talking about how you said they were transparent.
The President. And by the way, when I closed our border, that was long ahead of what anybody—you can ask anybody that was in the room. Twenty-one people. I was the one person that wanted to do it. Deborah can tell you that better than anybody. I was the one person that wanted to do it. You know why? Because I don't believe everything I hear, and I closed. And if we didn't close our border early, very early, long before the kind of dates you're talking about— we would have had thousands and probably hundreds of thousands more death.
Please.
Q. I'm talking about how you said——
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Please. That's enough. Thank you.
Q. ——they were transparent.
Coronavirus Impact on the African American Community
Q. Mr. President, last week, you said that you would have data in the coming days about the coronavirus's disproportionate impact on Black Americans.
The President. Yes. That's being worked on very strongly.
Q. When will we have that?
The President. I would say within 2 weeks. And it's being worked on. Deborah, we're working on that very strongly.
Vice President Michael R. Pence. The CDC—[inaudible].
The President. Okay, CDC is working, but we're getting reports on that. Yes, please, go ahead.
Q. Hi, Mr. President, two——
Q. Mr. President——
The President. No, in the back. Yes.
Resumption of Economic and Commercial Activity
Q. Mr. President, you're talking about reopening parts of the country by the end of the month. And if you do that, and as a result, you see a spike in cases in those areas, do you have——
The President. We may not—but we may not.
Q. Do you have any—[inaudible]?
The President. You know, some countries have and some countries haven't. I'm watching other countries. I'm studying other countries as they open. I mean, I don't want to go into names because, for some, it would be a little bit embarrassing. But I'm studying other countries as we go along.
So, on that, we have looked at every country that's opened, some successfully, some okay. No total disaster, but some okay. And some have to go back to the hotspot and fix the hotspot. We think we're going to do it very successfully.
Again, we have one country, but we have lots of different pieces. It's a puzzle. We have beautiful pieces, beautiful States with capable Governors. They know when it's time to open.
And we don't want to put pressure on anybody. I'm not going to put any pressure on any governor to open. I'm not going to say to Governor Cuomo, ""You've got to open within 7 days."" I want him to take his time, do it right, and then open New York. I'm not putting any pressure on the Governors. Some of them don't need pressure or not pressure. I mean, they're ready to go.
And that's a good thing.
So we'll open it up in beautiful, little pieces as it comes along. Please, go ahead. Behind you.
New York State
Q. Yes. Just a quick question. You spoke about Governor Cuomo. Just wondering if you have any thoughts on some of his remarks from earlier today, where he basically said that were New York to be pressured to be open, it would be a—it would cause a constitutional crisis.
And he basically said that you declared yourself ""King Trump."" So I'm wondering if you heard those thoughts and——
The President. Yes, I mean, I've declared myself as king. You know, I heard he said that. But I didn't see the remarks. But he understands how we helped him.
He needed help. We gave him 2,900 hospital beds; he didn't use them. We gave him a ship; he didn't use them. And I'm not saying—but I'm saying that's good, because you know what? That means he didn't need them. But we said it was too much, but we wanted to err—we said, ""Err on the side of caution,"" as I said. We said, ""Look, we don't think you need it, but if you do, we're going to have them built.""
And the Army Corps of Engineers did a fantastic job. And the U.S. Navy did a fantastic job, when we moved a ship that was not meant for COVID, and we had it redesigned for COVID. But they still didn't have very many people going in.
No, we are—we'll get along just fine. He understands. We'll get along just fine. Please.
Q. Mr. President——
Resumption of Economic and Commercial Activity/Social Distancing Guidelines
Q. Mr. President, how do you assure—how do you assure workers in States that may reopen that are fearful about going back to work for fear of getting sick? What's your——
The President. Talk up, please. Louder.
Q. What's your assurance to workers who are asked to go back to work, but are fearful of doing so?
The President. Well, that's going to be up to the Governors. The Governors are going to want to make sure everything is safe. Now, I think that companies can do testing on a, maybe, weekly basis; you don't have to do it every day with the same worker, but they can do testing. They can do temperature gauges. They can do a lot of different things.
And you know, we're only talking about for a period of time. You know, eventually, we want to get back to where we were. We want people actually sitting next to each other in ballgames, eventually. You know, we're not going to rip out every other seat in baseball stadiums and football stadiums. We want to go back to where we were.
I want people to understand that. We're not going to be like the way you are. We have 300 reporters in the back that want to sit. Look at the—look at this, the way this looks. I don't even like the way it looks, although I have a lot fewer reporters; that's okay with me.
But look at the way this looks. I've never seen anything—John, I've never seen anything quite like it. But there are a lot of people—we don't want this. I don't want this. I don't want this.
Eventually, we're going back, where restaurants that had 150 seats are going to have 150 seats, not 50 seats, because they can't make it at 50 seats. But more importantly, the atmosphere is even better. We have to get used to it. We have to get used to. I don't know that people are going to be shaking hands as readily. Some will.
I said to some of the hospital people today, ""So will people be shaking hands again?"" And I must say, I was a little surprised most of them said, ""Probably,"" because there is some kind of a thing to it. I was never a big hand shaker, but when I ran for politics, I said, ""I think I better start shaking people's hands.""
Go ahead, John.
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act/Paycheck Protection Program
Q. Mr. President, a couple of financial questions, if I could. Larry Kudlow said this morning that, at the current run rate, the Paycheck Protection money will run out very soon. The plan to re- up it is stalled in Congress. What can you do, as President, to try to move that forward?
The President. Well, we're trying to get it done. The problem is the Democrats want to put all sorts of things. Last time, they put Kennedy Center, and I hated putting Kennedy Center. And I've great respect for Kennedy Center, but I hated putting it in the bill because it's just not appropriate. Right?
And—but they wanted it in for whatever reason. They had their own political reason. And, John, I said, ""Watch the way that blows up."" And it blew up. I think it blew up in their face. We want to take care of our workers. We'll worry about other things and other pet projects of Democrats—and also Republicans—later.
But it's been a tremendously successful program. I think you see it. The banks have stepped up. Hundreds of thousands of loan applications approved. Money is going out. It's been a tremendous program. Really, it's been—and obviously, it was at a point where we're almost—you know, we're almost—the money will be expired, and we could use a refill for the workers. We want to be able to make sure that small businesses stay open, John. And I think that'll happen.
Yes, go ahead. Please.
Resumption of Economic and Commercial Activity/California
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Today California's Governor set out a list of six criteria for reopening the economy there. Did he consult with you on that?
And also, you said earlier that there were as many as 20 States that could reopen their economies as early as May 1? Could you list some of those——
The President. No, I didn't say all of them by May 1, but there are 20 States—actually, I was given a number. Twenty-nine States are in very, very good shape. I don't want to say whether or not the Governor spoke with me about that, but we've had a very good relationship—Gavin Newsom. And—a very, very good relationship.
Yes, in the back. Go ahead, please.
Coronavirus Impact on Food Supply
Q. Mr. President, thank you very much. I have two questions. One is from a person who can't——
The President. One question.
Q. But a person who can't be here. And so I——
The President. Who cares? If he can't be here, that's too bad, you know. Right?
Q. All right. Well, one question that I have is about the—the United Nations economist, Máximo Torero, says that there is—there's a danger that the food supply could be interrupted during this pandemic. And I wanted to know what you're going to do about t","hat?
The President. Well, I think our farmers are incredible. They're producing levels of food, like, just unbelievable. Our transportation—that's one of the reasons I have the transportation people on the line tomorrow for the delivery of the food. No, we're doing phenomenally with the food.
And I will say, the stores Kroger and Walmart, which has a lot of the food and many of the stores, they seem to be in very good shape, but I haven't heard that at all. We're going to be very strong on food supply.
Okay, how about one more question? Go ahead, please.
Federal Coronavirus Guidelines/Resumption of Economic and Commercial Activity
Q. Yes, the—the death projections that you mentioned earlier are based on full social distancing until the end of May.
The President. Yes.
Q. So if you ease up on these guidelines now, how many more Americans do you think are going to die?
The President. Well, I'm not easing up. First of all, we'll have guidelines, even for the States that open. And they'll be guidelines. But we will not have any problem with that.
Your question is a very interesting question, but the States that are opening are not States which will have a problem with that. Plus, they will have to adhere to guidelines until a certain point into the future when the enemy is vanquished.
Q. The reason they don't have a problem now is because of social distancing. So if you ease the guidelines——
The President. No, the reason they don't have is—is partially, and some of that will stay in effect. Much of it will stay in effect for a period of time. But the reason, also, is that they're different kinds of States. They have lots of room. They have fewer people and they have lots of room, and that's one of the primary reasons.
I want to thank you all very much. So a lot of positive things are happening. We're going to have some very strong recommendations for the Governors. We're going to work with the Governors. The Governors are going to do a good job. And if they don't do a good job, we're going to come down on them very hard. We'll have no other choice.
Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.
Q. Is that your economic—[inaudible]?"
"May 11, 2020",The President's News Conference,Donald J. Trump,"Donald J. Trump, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/341950",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1241,"The President. Thank you very much. Thank you. We're here today to provide an update on the unprecedented testing capacity developed by the United States, the most advanced and robust testing system anywhere in the world, by far. This afternoon I'll also announce new steps that we're taking to make tests even more widely available.
To battle a virus, my administration marshaled every resource at our Nation's disposal: public, private, military, economic, scientific, and industrial, all at your disposal. We launched the largest manufacturing ramp-up since the Second World War. There's been nothing like it since.
At the center of this industrial and scientific mobilization was the development of our coronavirus testing capabilities. In the span of just a few short months, we've developed a testing capacity unmatched and unrivaled anywhere in the world, and it's not even close. This is a core element of our plan to safely and gradually reopen America. And we're opening, and we're starting, and there's enthusiasm like I haven't seen in a long time.
Every American should be proud of the amazing array of talent, skill, and enterprise our Nation has brought to this challenge. In 3 months, the FDA has authorized more than 92 different tests, and over 9 million have been performed here in the United States. Three weeks ago, we were conducting roughly 150,000 tests per day. Now we're doing approximately 300,000 tests per day—a 100-percent increase—and it will go up substantially from that number.
This week, the United States will pass 10 million tests conducted, nearly double the number of any other country. We're testing more people per capita than South Korea, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Sweden, Finland, and many other countries—and in some cases, combined.
On Friday, the FDA authorized coronavirus antigen tests, an alternative testing technology that can be much more readily manufactured. Quidel Corporation, which makes this newly authorized point-of-care test, estimates that it will be able to manufacture 150,000 tests per day, immediately increasing to 300,000 tests per day within just a few weeks.
To further expand our Nation's testing capabilities, this afternoon I am announcing that my administration is—and that we've got this all approved; it's all done—is sending $1 billion to America's States, Territories, and Tribes. So this has all been approved. We've gotten it done, completed. The money is going out. This major investment will ensure that America continues to conduct more tests than any country on Earth by far.
I said from the beginning that the Federal Government would back up the States and help them build their testing capability and capacities, and that's exactly what's happened. This partnership has truly flourished. We have really had a very good relationship with the States and the Governors and other representatives within the States, a relationship like, I think I can honestly say, has not been seen in this country for many, many years.
The Governors and us are working together very closely not only on testing, but on ventilators, where we have a capacity that's, at this point, virtually unlimited. And we're sending ventilators—as you probably heard from other countries, we're sending many, many thousands of ventilators to other countries because they're in tremendous need. And I think building up a lot of good will, but much more importantly than that, we're saving a lot of lives. Most States are now doing a great job. My administration located 5,000 machines in 700 labs across all 50 States, and Governors have learned how to maximize these testing resources. The Federal Government is also supporting States with vital supplies, quick approvals of new tests, and one-on-one coaching from the team here at the White House on how to increase capacity and increase it very quickly.
In recent weeks, we've held multiple conference calls with every State, as well as with DC and Puerto Rico. We jointly developed testing projections and goals for each State for the month of May, altogether totaling 12.9 million tests. Think of that: 12.9 million tests.
Today I'm announcing that my administration will provide the collection supplies to help States meet their targets and meet them rapidly. During the month of May, FEMA and HHS will be delivering 12.9 million swabs to States nationwide. We already have them; the delivery will be very quick. We're prepared to provide millions of additional swabs if any State is on a pace to surpass its goal. And their goals are very high. We've set them very high; we've told them to set them very high.
My administration will also provide approximately 9 million transport media, which are used to transfer swabs to the lab processing. A complicated process, but we've made it simple. As a result of these actions, every single State will be able to test more people per capita in May alone than South Korea has tested in 4 months since the outbreak began.
This major commitment is possible because of the massive mobilization of American industry, including Puritan Medical Products, U.S. Cotton, Abbott Labs, and Thermo Fisher. Some of these incredible companies produced and produce rapidly for us, and their products are here with us this afternoon. These are all different products that were literally just developed and—if you can imagine that. And these are the best machines and the best equipment anywhere in the world. And other countries are calling us, and we're trying to work as much as we can, not only on ventilators, but also with testing.
My administration also continues our tireless effort to expand testing in the most underserved communities. Through our partnership with the private sector, leading pharmacies and retailers are now operating over 240 testing sites across the country, and that's in addition to all of the other sites that we have working. Seventy percent of these sites are located in communities with unique vulnerabilities.
There will be more than 300 sites by the end of this week, and retailers are making plans to open up hundreds and hundreds more locations within the next 30 days. These additional sites are helping us ensure access to testing in every community. My administration is fighting relentlessly to protect all citizens of every color and creed from this terrible virus, the invisible enemy.
In addition to vast amounts of testing supplies, my administration has partnered with the private sector to coordinate the delivery of more than 90 million N95 masks, and these are of the highest quality—many are made right here in the United States, a capacity we didn't have at all at the beginning—126 million surgical masks—likewise, many are made here; 9 million face shields; 21 million surgical gowns; 993 million gloves; and 10,690 ventilators. We're building thousands of ventilators in numerous plants all across our country. It's incredible, actually.
This global pandemic has inflicted great pain and hardship on our people. It should have never been allowed to happen. It should have been stopped at the source. We mourn for every life the virus has claimed, and we share the grief of all of you who have lost a loved one, and that goes worldwide too—many, many countries, 184 countries, at least.
Thanks to the courage of our citizens and our aggressive strategy, hundreds of thousands of lives have been saved. And we have saved—and if you look at on a per-100,000 basis, we're at the best part of the pack, right on the bottom. Germany and us are leading the world. Germany and the United States are leading the world: lives saved per hundred thousand.
In every generation, through every challenge and hardship and danger, America has risen to the task. We have met the moment, and we have prevailed. Americans do whatever it takes to find solutions, pioneer breakthroughs, and harness the energies we need to achieve a total victory.
Day after day, we're making tremendous strides. With the dedication of our doctors and nurses—these are incredible people, these are brave people, these are warriors—with the devotion of our manufacturing workers, food suppliers, and lab technicians, and with the profound patriotism of the American people, we will defeat this horrible enemy, we will revive our economy, and we will transition into greatness. That's a phrase you're going to hear a lot, because that's what's going to happen.
We're going into the third quarter, and we're going to do well. In the fourth quarter, we're going to do very good. And next year, I think we're going to have one of the best years we've ever had, because there's a tremendous pent-up demand. It's a demand—and I'm feeling it. I've felt things a lot over my life, and I've made a lot of good calls. It's a demand like I don't think I've ever seen. There's a pent-up demand. There's a spirit of this country like few have seen. And I think you can say—and we've helped a lot of the countries a lot. Really, a lot. There's a tremendous spirit all over the world to beat this terrible, terrible thing.
But we're transitioning to greatness, and the greatness is going to be in the fourth quarter, but it's really going to be next year, and it's going to be a year like we've never had before. I really believe that. As good as we've done—and we've done great; we had the best economy in the history of the world, not just here, but anywhere in the world. You can talk China, you can talk any other country—we had the best economy anywhere in the world.
And we were going for numbers, whether it was unemployment numbers, where we had our best numbers; employment, also, numbers—a little different—where we had our best numbers, almost 160 million people. All of that—we had the greatest stock market numbers ever. I think we had 142 days where we set records in a short period of time. A hundred and fifty-two days, we set records in the stock market. We rebuilt our military, all built in the United States. All of our equipment built—$1.5 trillion plus.
On the southern border, the wall is being built. It's being built rapidly. And now you don't hear the opponents talking too much about the border. They don't like to talk about it, because it seemed that we were right on a lot of things. One of the things we were right about—one of the many things was the border. We have a very powerful border. Now, we had one of the best weeks in the history of our border, between the United States and Mexico—our southern border. We have very few people coming in—very, very few. Almost record low numbers.
And the wall is being built. It's up to 181 miles already. It's being built. It's being built rapidly. People don't talk about it anymore because it's very successful. In the area where the wall has built—that is a lot still, but we want to be up to 450 by a very short period of time. Early next year, we should be up to 450 and, very shortly after that, over 500 miles to be completed.
But it's had a tremendous impact. But again, we've had the best numbers. The last thing we want now with this pandemic is for people to come across our southern border. And again, we're doing record numbers, meaning record low numbers.
So I just want to thank everybody, and I want to introduce Admiral Giroir—if you could, please come up and Brad, if you would—Brad Smith. And they're going to do a little explaining as to what we've done with regard to testing and how successful it's been. And then, we'll take some questions after that. Thank you very much.
Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services for Health Brett P. Giroir. Well, thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership and for your high expectations that really made this all come together and for the uniform support of everyone in the White House and the administration. And thank you, Secretary Azar, for providing his leadership at HHS and allowing both Brad and I the opportunity to work on this project.
I think it's clear that America does lead the world in testing. I'll go through some of the charts that show that we lead quantitatively. I will also suggest that we lead in the diversity of tests, which are very important to establish the testing ecosystem to keep America safe. And clearly, as we've said multiple times, no one beats America when it comes to quality.
So let's start potentially with the next slide.
[At this point, Assistant Secretary Giroir presented and discussed a series of slides detailing U.S. coronavirus testing capacity. He concluded his remarks as follows.]
And combined with that, the Secretary's Office of Minority Health will soon be awarding a large contract to guarantee a national network of State, local, and community-based organizations to assure that those underserved, particularly racial and ethnic minorities, are linked to the services that they need, not only testing, but in care as well.
And with that, I'd like to hand it over to Brad Smith, who's the Director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, but has really been the chief operating officer to make all of this come together.
Brad.
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Deputy Administrator Brad Smith. Thank you, Admiral. I want to talk through a little bit specifically the work that we've been doing with the States.
So, as the admiral mentioned, over the past few weeks, we've been working with each State to set a target for their testing goal for May. Within—over the series of a couple of different calls, we've aligned on what those goals are. And as the Admiral mentioned and the President mentioned, they add up to over 12.9 million tests in the month of May.
[Deputy Administrator Smith presented and discussed a series of slides detailing Federal-State collaboration in expanding coronavirus testing capacity.]
So we hope that we've put together the right pieces of the puzzle: having access points for patients and Americans across the country, having the specimen-collection supplies needed to take the test, having the machines, and then also having the lab testing supplies with the machines.
So thank you very much.
The President. Thank you very much, Brad. And maybe you'll both stay there. Could be some questions.
Okay. Please, John [John Roberts, Fox News]. Go ahead.
Coronavirus Among White House Staff 
Q. [Inaudible]—you can't hear me. We had a situation here at the White House on Friday, where a member of the Vice President's staff tested positive for coronavirus, which has now caused three of the top U.S. officials involved in the coronavirus response to self-isolate. A two-part question: Where did the system break down to allow that to happen? And where—what would you say to employers who look at the experience here at the White House and say, ""Are we ready for this?""
The President. I don't think the system broke down at all. One person tested positive, surprisingly, because, the previous day, tested negative. And three people that were in contact—relative contact, who I believe they've all tested totally negative, but they are going to, for a period of time, self-isolate. So that's not breaking down. It can happen. It's the hidden enemy. Remember that. It's the hidden enemy. And so things happen. But the three tested negative. The one who tested positive will be fine. They will be absolutely fine.
Yes, John.
Q. And what do you say, Mr. President, to other companies who may look at this and say, ""I don't know if we're ready for all of this""?
The President. Well, I think, you know, we have a lot of people in the White House. And we had one. Basically, we had one person. So—and we had a lot of people that work here. This building is shocking, if you looked at the numbers. And it's also tremendous numbers of people coming in. Normally, you wouldn't do that. But because we're running a country, we want to keep our country running. So we have a lot of people coming in and out. Many of those people—most of those people are tested depending on what portion of the Oval Office area they're going in. Everybody coming into the President's office gets tested. And I've felt no vulnerability whatsoever, John.
But the two people, as I said, and three people, are—they have been tested, and it's negative, and be probably out of quarantine very quickly. Okay?
Jon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News].
Coronavirus Among White House Staff/Coronavirus Testing Access and Technology 
Q. Mr. President, if I can follow up on that: Your staff, your senior staff, as you just referenced, is able to get tested every day. When will it be that Americans across the country will be able to get tested every day, as they go back to work?
The President. Very soon. I mean, really, very soon. It's an interesting question, because normally, you would have said that ""you are not tested,"" and you would have been, you know, knocking us for not getting tested. So, if we get tested, it's a problem. And if we don't get tested, it's a problem.
But I like the way your question was phrased better this way, because it is a positive. We are tested; we have great capability. You look at all of these machines here. They're incredible machines. They're the best anywhere in the world. No place in the world has this kind of equipment. Other countries are calling—sophisticated countries—and they're calling. Lots of countries. And we're trying to make as much as we can available to them, because there's nothing like what we've been able to do in a—literally a couple of months.
What they've been able to do—the private sector, what they—how they got it done. This is a 5- to 15-minute test, as an example—the Abbott Laboratories test. These tests are highly sophisticated—very quick, very good. This is things that didn't even exist a short while ago.
So we do have a great testing capability at the White House. We're doing it. And I think, generally speaking—we had a call with the Governors the other day—generally speaking, without exception, they were all extremely happy with what's going on, with respect to their testing. Okay?
Resumption of Economic and Commercial Activity Q. But should people be told to go back to work until they have that assurance that they and their coworkers are able to get a test——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——which we're still not there?
The President. We're leaving that up to the Governors, as you know. And if we see something wrong, we'll call them out, and we'll stop it. But we are leaving it up to the Governors. Some are being not aggressive enough, in my opinion, and some are being a little bit aggressive, but they're being very careful.
And the people of the country, they've learned a lot over the last 2 months. They've learned about social distancing and washing your hands and other things that we've all learned and talked about. They've learned about—I see everybody—just about everybody has a face mask on. They've learned about face masks, the good and the bad, by the way. It's not a one-sided thing, believe it or not.
But our country has learned. Our country has been incredible. And you see the numbers; they're dropping very substantially. The numbers are dropping around our country very, very substantially.
So we leave that, Jon, up to the Governors, and I think they're making a lot of good decisions. We've had, as I said, a great relationship with Governors, Democrat and Republican. And I think, overall, they're making very good decisions.
Nobody in this group. All of the ones behind the rope. That's interesting. Please.
Coronavirus Testing Access and Technology/Coronavirus Mortality 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You said in your comments earlier: ""We have met the moment. We have prevailed."" To you, sir, is the mission accomplished? Even with 1.4 million——
The President. No, we've prevailed on testing, is what I'm referring to. That was with regard to testing. You never prevail when you have 90,000 people, 100,000 people; when you have 80,000 people, as of today; when you have this—the kind of death you're talking about, when you have potentially millions of people throughout the world that are dying. That's not prevailed——
What I'm talking about is: We have a great testing capacity now. It's getting even better. There's nobody close to us in the world. And we certainly have done a great job on testing. And testing is a big—is a very big, important function. By the way, some people consider it more important than others, to be honest with you. But testing certainly is a very important function, and we have prevailed. We have the best equipment anywhere in the world.
Okay, please. Yes. Please, go ahead.
China/Coronavirus Vaccine Development 
Q. There are a variety of reports that Chinese hackers are attempting to steal technology related to vaccine research. Is this something you're concerned about? What can you say?
The President. So what else is new with China? What else is new? Tell me. I'm not happy with China. They should have stopped this at the source. They could have stopped it right at the source. So now you're telling me they're hacking? So I just say this, Steve [Steve A. Holland, Reuters]: What else is new?
Q. If I could follow up, sir——
The President. We're watching it very closely. China-U.S. Trade Agreement 
Q. The—if I could follow up, sir: The South China Morning Post, the Beijing newspaper, says that China would like to reopen negotiations on the trade deal to make the terms more favorable to them. Is this something you'd be interested in doing?
The President. No. Not at all. Not even a little bit. No, I'm not interested. We signed the deal. I had heard that too: They'd like to reopen the trade talk to make it a better deal for them.
China has been taking advantage of the United States for many, many years, for decades, because we had people at this position, right here where I'm standing, sitting right in that office—the Oval Office—that allowed that to happen.
No, I'm not interested in that. Let's see if they live up to the deal that they signed. Okay?
Please, go ahead.
Economic Stimulus Legislation/Economic Recovery Efforts 
Q. Mr. President, what are your thoughts about a second round of direct payments to Americans that's included in the House Democratic bill?
The President. Well, we're talking about that with a lot of different people. I want to see a payroll tax cut. I want to see various things that we want. I want the workers to be taken care of.
But we are talking about that. We're negotiating with the Democrats. We'll see what happens. But as I said, it's a transition, and it's a—this is really going to be, in my opinion—we'll see, but I think it's going to be something that's going to be very special. It's a transition to greatness, and greatness is next year, right from the beginning. I think we're going to do fantastically well.
I view the third quarter, as I said, as a transition quarter. It could be pretty good, but a transition quarter. Toward the end of the fourth quarter, you're going to see some numbers that are going to be tremendous, I think. And next year, you're going to have potentially the kind of numbers that you saw before, and maybe even better, because there is that pent-up demand that is—you know, a lot of people wanted to do things. They were ready to do things, and they've had to hold back because of the virus.
So I think you're going to have, with that pent-up demand, a phenomenal year next year, unless somebody messes it up by coming along and raising taxes—doubling, tripling, quadrupling your taxes. Like a certain party, namely the Democrats want to do. You'll mess it all up.
You know, we had the greatest in the world. I presided—this administration presided—over it. It got great for a reason. And we'll do it again, and we'll do it very quickly and very easily. I see that happening.
Yes, ma'am. Please.
Protective Face Masks 
Q. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Almost everyone, as you noted, in the Rose Garden is wearing a mask today. Why haven't you required everyone at the White House to wear masks before now?
The President. Well, if they're a certain distance from me or if they're a certain distance from each other, they do. In the case of me, I'm not close to anybody. I'd like to be close to these two gentlemen. They're hard-working, great men, but they just said, frankly, ""Let's keep it this way."" So, obviously, in my case, I'm very far away from everyone. But if you look at all of those people over there, every one of them from what I see—these are White House staffers, they're White House representatives, they're White House executives, and everybody has a mask on.
We've had—just about everybody I've seen today has worn a mask.
Yes. Please, go ahead.
Q. Is that—were you the one who required that, sir?
The President. Yes, I did. I did. I required it. Yes.
Please. Go ahead.
Coronavirus Testing Access 
Q. Mr. President, you're now promising that everyone who needs a test will be able to get one at some point soon. Can you give us some figures on what you're changing to ramp up testing? When will that be a true statement, exactly? And how exactly are you going to accomplish that?
The President. Well, it's a true statement already. We have more testing than any country in the world by far. But I'll let Admiral go into a little bit of the future.
Assistant Secretary Giroir. When you look at the testing numbers that we worked with collaboratively with the State leadership—it's not just with the Governor, but the State health officers, the State epidemiologists, the public health labs—it's really a combination of testing those who need something for diagnosis, diagnostic testing; tracing—so testing those who have been around the people with a diagnosis.
[Assistant Secretary Giroir continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
The other thing I would say is, particularly as we move into the summer, there are surveillance mechanisms—and I talked about them before—like a weather radar. And just think about that weather radar. The influenza-like illness network, which is at about 75 percent of health care institutions and syndromic surveillance. So if we see a blip on that weather radar, combined with CDC personnel in every single State, and with contact tracers, we really run to the fire, right? And that's when you detect, you trace, and you shut off that outbreak right when it starts.
Q. [Inaudible]
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Phil [Philip Rucker, Washington Post], go ahead.
Q. ——there does seem to be a double standard here, Mr. President, where members of your own staff can get tests frequently when they need it, but ordinary Americans cannot.
The President. Yes.
Q. So when will the rest of America have the same access that members of your own White House have to testing?
The President. And you know what? If we didn't get the tests, if we did no tests in the White House, you'd be up complaining, ""Why aren't you getting tests for the White House?"" See, we can't win, because if we didn't get the tests, you'd be up—I understand you very well, better than you understand yourself—and frankly, if we didn't get tests done, you'd be up complaining about the fact that we didn't have the tests done. Now that we're doing so well on tests and so quick and so fast—5 minutes, et cetera—and so accurate, you're complaining that we're getting too many tests. So you can't win.
Go ahead, Phil.
Coronavirus Among White House Staff 
Q. Yes, Mr. President, many Americans want to return to their normal lives, but they're afraid to do so. How can you ensure Americans that it's safe to go to their own workplaces when the most secure workplace in the country, the White House, cannot contain the spread of the coronavirus that's infected some of your own staff?
The President. Well, when you say ""some,"" so we have a person and the person got—something happened right after a test was done. Three other people met that person, came into relative contact—very little contact—and they're self-quarantining. That is not exactly not controlling it. We—I think we've controlled it very well.
We have hundreds and hundreds of people a day pouring into the White House. It's a massive office complex, including the very large building right behind us that you know so well. So I think we're really doing a very good job in watching it. And I think it's very well contained actually.
And part of the reason, it is because of all the tests we're able to give. But it was one person, and the other people were only people—they're quarantined. You understand this, Phil; they're quarantined for a specific reason. The reason is, they were in the general proximity of the one person. And the one person, I believe, will be fine in a very short period of time.
Vice President Michael R. Pence 
Q. Why hasn't Vice President Pence followed the CDC guidelines of self-isolation and other people who might have been exposed to that person?
The President. Well, that, I'm going to have to ask that he will give you that information. Whatever he is proceeding and doing, he will give you that information. I'll make sure that they put out a notice.
John. Go ahead. Please.
Coronavirus Impact on Children/Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome 
Q. Mr. President, up until now, it's thought that the most vulnerable people were those above the age of 60 or 70 or 80 and that children were pretty much, I don't want to say immune from this, but weren't affected by it. But all day long in the news today, we have been hearing and seeing this terrible syndrome——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——that some 85 children have now. Three of them have died. What is the Task Force talking about in terms of that? And what could be done about it?
The President. Yes, we're seeing that all over the world now with young children. A very, very tiny percentage, but it's still—it's the swelling and the skin rash. And we're looking at that very closely, John. It's a phenomenon that's just been brought to everyone's attention a couple of weeks ago.
Admiral, you may have something to say about"," that.
Assistant Secretary Giroir. So thank you for pointing that out. And again, I've said many times, I'm a pediatrician and a pediatric ICU doctor. This syndrome, which we call—are similar to Kawasaki syndrome. It has been seen in a novel coronavirus before, and it's associated with illnesses. So we have a very strong activation on this.
[Assistant Secretary Giroir continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
We know what the basic treatment is, but this is a little bit different than we normally see. So there really is an activation among all the branches within HHS, working with networks at children's hospitals and ICU nets. It is a small percentage, but it is quite frightening. And this reflects the fact that this virus affects the vasculature. We see clotting; we see strokes. And this is a vasculature phenomenon of inflammation we see in children.
Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome/Coronavirus Morality Rates 
Q. Mr. President, with this newly emerging syndrome now among young children, what do you say to parents who would like to get their children back to school, but are now looking at this and potentially afraid to do that?
The President. Well, again it's a tiny percentage. But you're right, so we're looking into it very strongly. And the admiral, as he said, he's known about this for long before this happened. But it is a very, very small percentage. And people recover from that; the children recover from that. Right?
Assistant Secretary Giroir. Yes, sir. Most do recover from this, but it is a serious, and it can be a fatal, condition. So we do want to make sure that parents understand that high fevers, red rashes, particularly on your child, you may need to contact your health care provider. There are treatments for this. They work very effectively if gotten early, at least for the vast majority of the cases.
The President. We're studying that very closely, and it's been on the radar for weeks actually, because we've seen this for quite a while. But it's been very rare, but we're looking at it very closely. It's very important to us.
I think one of the things we're most proud of is—this just came out—deaths per 100,000 people, death—so deaths per 100,000 people: Germany and the United States are at the lowest rung of that ladder. Meaning, low is a positive, not a negative. Germany and the United States are the two best in deaths per 100,000 people, which, frankly, to me, that's perhaps the most important number there is.
Please, go in the back, please.
Coronavirus Testing Access/Shooting Death of Ahmaud Arbery in Glynn County, Georgia 
Q. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions: one on the Ahmaud Arbery case and one on the coronavirus. The first on the coronavirus: The Vice President is said to be in some sort of self-isolating—keeping his distance from people. What do you say to Americans who say: ""How can you keep me safe? How can you reopen the government, if even the Vice President is self-isolating?"" And why hasn't testing gotten up to the point where every American who wants to test can get a test?
The President. Well, the Vice President, first of all, has been tested, and he's negative—and was tested yesterday, tested today, and he's negative. He's in very good shape. And I think that that's going to be fine.
As far as Americans getting a test, they should all be able to get a test right now. They should be able to get a test. That's the problem with a question like that. We go through a whole announcement saying ""We're number one in the world by far,"" by a factor of two, and even three and four depending on where you're looking, and I get a question, ""When will everybody be able to get tested?"" If somebody wants to be tested right now, they'll be able to be tested.
As far as the incident, I think it's horrible, and it's certainly being looked at by many people. I'm speaking to many people about it. He looked—I saw the picture of him in his tuxedo; it was so beautiful. I mean, he looks like a wonderful, young guy. Would have been a wonderful—I mean, just a wonderful guy. I think it's a horrible thing. I think it's a horrible thing.
Now, with that being said, as you know, they're studying the case very carefully. They're interviewing everybody involved, and we'll see what happens. To me, it's a very sad thing.
I spoke to a number of people that are very much involved in it. I've been following that one very closely. It breaks your heart to watch it. It breaks your heart. And certainly, the video was a—it was a terrible-looking video to me.
But you have a lot of people looking at it, and hopefully, an answer is going to be arrived at very quickly. But it's something that is heartbreaking.
Shooting Death of Ahmaud Arbery in Glynn County, Georgia 
Q. I have a specific question about the case, if I could ask it.
The President. Go ahead.
Q. The specific question I have is, you've said that there possibly are things that happened that were not recorded on the tape. Could you just expound on what you mean by that and your thoughts——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——on what—[inaudible].
The President. Well, I saw the tape, and when they moved left, I don't believe—when they moved left, outside of the tape, nobody saw what was going on. Nobody saw it. It's an empty spot on the tape, I guess.
Now, do they have additional tapes? I hope. But I will say that it's something that, based on what I saw, doesn't look good. Somebody that I have a lot of respect for is Senator Scott of South Carolina, you know who I'm talking about. He's a great gentleman. He's a great Senator. He's a great gentleman. Tim Scott. And I called him 2 days ago. I said: ""Tim, what do you think? Tell me. What do you think?"" He's very disturbed by it. He's very disturbed. And I'm very disturbed also.
Please, go ahead.
Coronavirus Testing Access and Technology 
Q. President Trump, thank you. I have two questions, one on testing and one on Democratic States that you've tweeted about. First, the money for this new testing support today comes from the CARE Act—CARES Act, which you signed into law 42 days ago. Did your delay in embracing widespread testing have anything to do with the desire to suppress the official number of U.S. cases and deaths as you try to reopen the country?
The President. No, we just wanted to make sure that we had the proper machinery apparatus and everything else out there before people started wasting money. It's a method of saving money. We wanted to make sure we had even things like this. Plus, they have machines that are far more complex than this. They have massive machines at some of the laboratories that can do millions of tests. We wanted to make sure everything was in place. Okay?
Go ahead.
Resumption of Economic and Commercial Activity/Secondary Effects of Social Isolation 
Q. And earlier today you tweeted that Democrats are moving slowly for political purposes. But why do you believe that their motive is politics rather than public safety? And how do you respond to criticism that you're also motivated by politics to try to grow the economy ahead of the election?
The President. Well, I think that if you look at Pennsylvania, as an example; if you look at various other States—I won't get into them—the people want to go back. The numbers are getting to a point where they can, and there just seems to be no effort on certain blue States to get back into gear. And the people aren't going to stand for it; they want to get back.
They're not going to stand for it. They want our country opened. I want our country opened too. I want it opened safely, but I want it open.
Don't forget, people are dying the other route. You can go with the enclosed route: Everything is closed up, you're in your house, you're not allowed to move. People are dying with that too. You look at drug addiction, you look at suicides, you look at some of the things that are taking place, people are dying that way too. You could make the case, it's in even greater numbers.
So it's a situation that some people—and I've noticed that some States could be moving more quickly. And also, at the same time, safety. Look, safety is paramount. But people are dying in the lockdown position too. And everybody understands that. They're just starting to find out. And look at what's going on with drugs, and look at what's happening with suicides.
Yes, please. Please, go ahead.
Coronavirus Prevalence Rates 
Q. Hi, Mr. President. So Americans have been self-quarantining for several months now, social distancing, yet we're still seeing about 20,000 new cases a day, 1- to 2,000 deaths. Is there anything else the administration is planning to do to get these new cases under control? Because we seem to be on a plateau. Or is this just a fact of life?
The President. Well, excuse me. There are 20,000—the numbers are way down from what they were two weeks ago. I mean, the numbers are really coming down, and very substantially. And this weekend was one of the lowest we've had. This is—you know, the numbers are coming down very rapidly all throughout the country, by the way. There may be one exception. But all throughout the country, the numbers are coming down rapidly. I think you see that, Admiral.
Coronavirus Mortality Projections 
Q. Yes, but does this—the models, sir, are projecting now 130,000 cases that go through August. Is that—do you agree with those models? Is that your expectation as well?
The President. Well, the models haven't been exactly accurate. These are models done by a lot of think tanks, a lot of universities. If you look at some of the models, they have been way off. Few of the models have been accurate.
But as far as the models are concerned, if you go by the model, we were going to lose 2.2 million people. And because we took—we mitigated—we did things that were very tough for our country to do, frankly. We had to turn off our whole magnificent economy. We had to turn down the whole country. We're at the lowest of all of the models.
I mean, if you look at, I guess, one-hundred-and-twenty—100- to 120,000 people would be at the low side. And we're at—there's nothing low. Look, nothing low. One is too many people. And I say it all the time: One person to lose for this is too many people. It's a disgrace what happened.
But if you look at the models, we're at a low—at the lowest of those projections. But the models are not models done necessarily by the White House. They're models done by many people all over the world. And if you take the most respected of those people, many of those models are wrong. I mean, they've been wrong as far as the U.S. is concerned, because those numbers are nowhere near what was projected, potentially.
Federal Coronavirus Response/Restrictions on Travel From China to the U.S. 
Q. Do you have an expectation of what the death toll is going to look like by the summer, by the——
The President. You know what? I don't want to think about it, even. I know that we're doing everything we can. We're doing a good job. We acted very early. We acted extremely early in keeping China out of our country and banning people from China coming in, other than our citizens, which we obviously had to take. And they were quarantined or watched carefully. They were tested. They were watched very carefully.
But we had about 40,000 people coming in from China, from Asia, and we had to obviously take the people. Can you imagine if I said, ""You're a U.S. citizen, and we're not going to take you""? That doesn't work.
So—but they were very carefully—I was with Ron DeSantis. He said they put—literally put the people that came in from China in quarantine for a substantial period of time.
No, that was a big decision. I think we saved hundreds of thousands of lives by acting very early. And when I did this—I think the admiral can say it—everybody was against my doing it. Everybody. Everybody was: the professionals, the doctors. I was pretty much by myself on that one. And it was a lucky thing we did it, because we saved hundreds of thousands of lives.
Yes, please. Go ahead.
Nursing Homes and Elder Care Facilities 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Earlier today the Vice President urged Governors to have all their nursing home residents tested. Why not just mandate that? Why not require that? Have you considered that?
The President. Well, I would certainly consider that. I will mandate it if you'd like. I would—I think it's important to do, and I think, frankly, some of the Governors were very lax with respect to nursing homes. It was obvious right from the beginning. The State of Washington, where 26 or 28 people died very early on. And I would have said, ""nursing homes."" And I did say ""nursing homes."" That's what they should. Now, some of the States—many of the States are doing that, but I think all of the States should be. They have the capacity to do it. They should be doing nursing home. That is a real vulnerability.
Coronavirus Among White House Staff 
Q. Could I follow on—the two staffers that were announced last week as testing positive, are you aware of any additional White House staff—[inaudible]? The President. No, not at all.
Q. Thank you.
The President. I'm only aware of people that saw them, were tested, the tests were negative, and they're quarantining anyway. So——
Please, go ahead.
Vice President Michael R. Pence 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask: Are you now, or are you considering, separating some more with Vice President Pence as a precautionary measure?
The President. Well, first of all, the job he's done on Task Force, the job he's done, frankly, as the Vice President of the United States has been outstanding. And he's a warrior too, just like doctors and nurses. I mean, he is working so hard, and he meets—he's coming into contact with a lot of people. But again, he tested negative, so we have to understand that. But he comes into contact with a lot of people.
It's something probably, during this quarantine period, we'll probably talk about. I have not seen him since then. But I would say that he will—he and I will be talking about that. Yes, we could talk on the phone.
Q. And I have a question for Admiral Giroir, if I could.
The President. Please.
Q. The President just said that Dr. Fauci, Dr. Hahn have tested negative. Then, why do they need to be isolating? Is there some concern that they could be spreading the virus in some ways? Are they concerned about the testing? Why do they need to isolate?
Assistant Secretary Giroir. So this is a very fundamental concept, and I'm so happy you brought that up, because it underlies a lot of the questions here. If you test negative just at that one point, that just means you have tested negative for that point in time. We know that the incubation period for this virus can be many days.
So the CDC guidelines really says that if you're in close contact, just testing negative on that one day doesn't mean you won't be positive later on. So the prudent and the recommended thing to do is to self-isolate yourself for the entire period of incubation and, really, then some. So that's what they're doing. It's a precautionary manner, because they were negative. We all hope that they remain negative, but if they turned positive in a day or two or became symptomatic, that's still possible, even with a negative test.
The President. Okay?
Q. Thank you, sir.
The President. Go ahead. Phil.
Q. Mr. President, in one of your Mother's Day tweets, you appear to accuse President Obama of the biggest political crime in American history, by far.
The President. Yes.
Former President Barack Obama/Investigation Into Russia's Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election 
Q. Those were your words. What crime exactly are you accusing President Obama of committing? And do you believe the Justice Department should prosecute him? The President. ""Obamagate""—it's been going on for a long time. It's been going on from before I even got elected. And it's a disgrace that it happened. And if you look at what's gone on, and if you look at, now, all of this information that's being released—and from what I understand, that's only the beginning—some terrible things happened, and it should never be allowed to happen in our country again.
And you'll be seeing what's going on over the next—over the coming weeks. But I—and I wish you'd write honestly about it, but unfortunately, you choose not to do so.
Yes. Jon, please.
Q. The crime—what is the crime exactly that you're accusing him of?
The President. You know what the crime is. The crime is very obvious to everybody. All you have to do is read the newspapers, except yours.
Jon, please.
Coronavirus Testing Access/Coronavirus Prevalence Rates 
Q. Yes, Mr. President, if I can just get a clarification on the testing. We've seen clearly that the numbers of tests have gone up.
The President. Yes.
Q. There have been some advancements on testing. But you've said twice here today that every American who wants a test can get a test.
The President. Yes.
Q. That's not the case. One-point-nine million tests per day is far short of every American that wants a test to be able to get a test.
The President. Well, I'm going to have the admiral—but I will say, just from listening and hearing, like you do—we all do—not everybody should get a test because they have to have certain things. And they're going to know when they're not feeling right. Those are the people that will be getting the test. But, Admiral, I'll let you take it from there, please.
Assistant Secretary Giroir. So everybody who needs a test can get a test. We have plenty of tests for that.
Q. [Inaudible]
Assistant Secretary Giroir. Right now, in America, anybody who needs a test can get a test in America, with the numbers we have. If you're symptomatic with a respiratory illness, that is an indication for a test, and you can get a test. If you need to be contact traced, you can get a test. And we hope—and not hope—we are starting to have asymptomatic surveillance, which is very important. Again, that's over 3 million tests per week. That is sufficient for everyone who needs a test—symptomatic, contact tracing, and to our best projections, the asymptomatic kind of surveillance we need to get that. And that's the way it is.
[Assistant Secretary Giroir continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
If I became symptomatic, I would get a test. And if it were positive, I would isolate and there'd be contact tracing to stop that just the way it was done here. If I'm not symptomatic, I do the precautions as everyone is recommended in phase one. And that's the essence of safety—safely opening America. The President. And, Jon, the numbers are coming way down, and they're coming down rapidly, and that's a beautiful thing to see. And that's pretty much universally all across the country. They're coming down very rapidly. So very important.
Please go ahead.
Coronavirus Testing Access/Meatpacking Plants 
Q. [Inaudible]—if I can ask the admiral if—so, Americans who are going back to work shouldn't expect—and shouldn't need, shouldn't want to have the same thing that people coming to work here at the White House have, which is the ability to get tested regularly, regardless of symptoms?
Assistant Secretary Giroir. So——
Q. Is that what you're saying?
Assistant Secretary Giroir. So let me clarify as well: People who come into close contact with the President get tested on a regular basis. Okay? If I were not in close contact with the President specifically, I would not get tested like most people here do not get tested. That's a very specific circumstance.
When I work at HHS, I go to HHS; I don't get tested. I do the exact thing that we ask Americans to do: to monitor your symptoms. If you are symptomatic, self-isolate, get tested with one of our community-based testing sites at your hospitals. There are even at-home testing now that has been authorized. And to cooperate; that if you need to be contact traced, be contact traced and cooperate with your local public health. But not everybody who walks in here gets tested every time they do. If you're symptomatic here, at HHS, at a meatpacking plant, at a school, you need to get tested.
The President. And the meatpacking plants now are doing very well. There's great testing around those plants. And we're finding out who had the problem. They're being quarantined. And the meatpacking is moving along very nicely.
But they were trouble spots. They were hot zones, definitely.
Please.
And you know, one thing I think is very important though, Jon, just to finish: We have now—and nobody says it; they just don't want to write it—by far, more tests than any other country in the world. Not even a contest. And the quality of our test is the best anywhere in the world. That's very important to say.
Please, go ahead.
Coronavirus Testing Access 
Q. So, to make sure I understand the White House's position, are you saying that right now you feel there is enough testing—adequate testing—across the United States? Or do you feel that it needs to be ramped up? And by how much, if so, does it need to be ramped up?
Assistant Secretary Giroir. We've been—I think we've been clear all along that we believe, and the data indicate, we have enough testing to do the phase one gradual reopening that has been supported in the President's plan and the Task Force's plan. And it has to be a phased reopening. Nobody is saying, ""Turn the light switch on, and everyone go,"" because then it would be really impossible to control the spread of the virus.
[Assistant Secretary Giroir continued his remarks, concluding as follows.] Now, I am not going to come here and say, ""We can absolutely swear it's God's truth that this is the number we need."" But we know we have enough to open, and we're going to be very careful with our ILINet, with our surveillance programs, and let the data come in to inform us even further as we grow and learn.
And I think Brad may——
Deputy Administrator Smith. And let me just add a little bit to that, because most days, I don't come to the White House to work; I either go to FEMA, or I go to HHS. And let me just talk you through what the protocols are there, because I would never get tested if I wasn't coming to the White House.
[Deputy Administrator Smith continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
And so there's a lot of precautions that we're taking in the Federal Government that are separate from testing, and those are the precautions that the agencies use that Admiral Giroir and I are working at every day are using to let us continue working.
Q. Mr. President——
The President. If people want to get tested, they get tested. We have the greatest capacity in the world. Not even close. If people want to get tested, they get tested. But, for the most part, they shouldn't want to get tested. There's no reason. They feel good. They don't have sniffles. They don't have sore throats. They don't have any problem. If they do feel there's something happening, they have the absolute—easy. In fact, Ron DeSantis of Florida, the Governor—doing a fantastic job in Florida—he said he's got a little bit of the opposite problem. He's got so much testing that people sit around and wait for people to come in, that they have far—a great overcapacity for testing. And there are numerous other States that have told me the same thing. That's, by the way, a good problem, not a bad problem. Okay?
Yes, go ahead, please.
Global Coronavirus Pandemic/China 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You said many times that the U.S. is doing far better than any other country when it comes to testing.
The President. Yes.
Q. Why does that matter? Why is this a global competition to you if, every day, Americans are still losing their lives and we're still seeing more cases every day?
The President. Well, they're losing their lives everywhere in the world. And maybe that's a question you should ask China. Don't ask me; ask China that question, okay? When you ask them that question, you may get a very unusual answer.
Yes. Behind you, please.
Q. Do you want to follow up?
Q. Sir, why are you saying that to me, specifically? That I should ask China?
The President. I'm telling you. I'm not saying it specifically to anybody. I'm saying it to anybody that would ask a nasty question like that.
Q. That's not a nasty question. Why does it matter, when——
The President. Okay. Anybody else? Please, go ahead. In the back. Please.
Q. I have two questions. The President. No, it's okay. We'll go over here.
Q. But you pointed to me. I have two questions, Mr. President.
The President. Next. Next, please.
Q. But you didn't—you called on me.
The President. I did, and you didn't respond, and now I'm calling on——
Q. Sorry, I just wanted to let——
The President. ——the young lady in the back. Please.
Q. I just wanted to let me colleague finish.
The President. Okay——
Q. But can I ask you a question, please?
The President. ——ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Q. But you called on me.
The President. Thank you very much."
"July 14, 2020",The President's News Conference,Donald J. Trump,"Donald J. Trump, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/343050",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1242,"The President. Thank you very much, everybody. Please. I hope it's not too hot. But it's pretty warm. Thank you.
So we've had a big day in the stock market. Things are coming back, and they're coming back very rapidly—a lot sooner than people thought. People are feeling good about our country. People are feeling good about therapeutics and possible vaccines. But we're going to go over quite a bit, and maybe at the end, we'll take some questions if we have time, if it's not too hot.
Today I signed legislation and an Executive order to hold China accountable for its oppressive actions against the people of Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which I signed this afternoon, passed unanimously through Congress. This law gives my administration powerful new tools to hold responsible the individuals and the entities involved in extinguishing Hong Kong's freedom. We've all watched what happened. Not a good situation. Their freedom has been taken away. Their rights have been taken away. And with it, goes Hong Kong, in my opinion, because it will no longer be able to compete with free markets.
A lot of people will be leaving Hong Kong, I suspect. And we're going to do a lot more business because of it, because we just lost one competitor. That's the way it is. We lost a very, very serious competitor, a competitor that we incentivized to take a lot of business and do well. And we gave them a lot of business by doing what we did. We gave them things that nobody else had the right to do, and that gave them a big edge over other markets. And because of that edge, they've done really historic business, tremendous business—far bigger than anybody would have thought, years ago, when we did this gift. We—it was really a gift to freedom.
Today I also signed an Executive order ending U.S. preferential treatment for Hong Kong. Hong Kong will now be treated the same as mainland China: no special privileges, no special economic treatment, and no export of sensitive technologies.
In addition to that, as you know, we're placing massive tariffs and have placed very large tariffs on China, first time that's ever happened to China. Billions of dollars have been paid to the United States, of which I've given quite a bit to the farmers and ranchers for our country because they were targeted. And that's been going on for 3 years. It's the first time anybody's ever done anything like that.
And prior to the plague pouring in from China, they were having the worst year, as you know, in 67 years. And I don't want them to have a bad year; I want them to have a good year, but they were taking advantage of the United States for many, many years, and that's stopping.
But then, they—then the virus came in, and the world is a different place. But we're now getting back, and one of the reasons the market is doing so—it's almost at the point that it was at prior to the plague. Almost. And we're getting very close. It's a great thing. It's an amazing thing, what our people have done and what they've endured.
No administration has been tougher on China than this administration. We imposed historic tariffs. We stood up to China's intellectual property theft, at a level that nobody has ever come close. We confronted untrustworthy Chinese technology and telecom providers. We convinced many countries—many countries—and I did this myself, for the most part—not to use Huawei, because we think it's an unsafe security risk. It's a big security risk. I talked many countries out of using it. If they want to do business with us, they can't use it. Just today I believe that U.K. announced that they're not going to be using it. And that was up in the air for a long time, but they've decided. And you look at Italy; you look at many other countries.
We withdrew from the Chinese-dominated WHO, and we fully rebuilt the United States military. The WHO—World Health Organization—we were paying close to $500 million a year. China was paying $39 million a year. And China had too much say. They worked it very hard, which is a bad thing done by our past administrations. But we were tough, and we were saying—I was asking—I said, ""Why are we paying so much more than China?"" China has 1.4 billion people; we have 325—probably 325 million, approximately. Nobody can give the exact count. We're trying to get an exact count. But you have, over the years, many illegals who have come into the country, so it depends on how you want to count it. But you could say 325 to 350 million people, as opposed to 1.4 billion people.
And the World Trade—World Trade is terrible. That deal is terrible. And the World Health is a terrible deal. We've been very tough on the World Trade Organization, and we've been, I guess, as tough as you can get on World Health. We withdrew our money. We told them we're getting out. It doesn't mean that someday we won't go back in. Maybe we will, when it's correctly run. But they made a lot of bad predictions, and they said a lot of bad things about what to do and how to do it. And they turned out to be wrong, and they were really a puppet of China.
And make no mistake: We hold China fully responsible for concealing the virus and unleashing it upon the world. They could have stopped it. They should have stopped it. It would have been very easy to do at the source when it happened.
In contrast, Joe Biden's entire career has been a gift to the Chinese Communist Party and to the calamity of errors that they've made. They made so many errors. And it's been devastating for the American worker. China has taken out hundreds of billions of dollars a year from our country. And we rebuilt China. I give them all the credit in the world. I don't give the credit for the people that used to stand here, because they allowed this to happen where hundreds of billions of dollars were taken out of the United States Treasury in order to rebuild China.
There's no company and no country in the world—no country in the world has ever ripped off the United States like the incredible job that they did on this country and the people that ran it. Possibly, it's one of the reasons—certainly, it's one of the very big reasons—trade and things related to trade—that I got elected in the first place. I've been talking about it for a long time, along with many other subjects, frankly.
Joe Biden supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization, one of the greatest geopolitical and economic disasters in world history. If you look at China, you look at the moment they joined the World Trade, they were flatlining for years and years and years and decades. And then, all of a sudden, they joined the World Trade Organization, and they went like a rocket ship. They were given all sorts of advantages. They were considered a developing country. As a developing country, they got tremendous advantages over the United States and other countries. And they took advantage of those advantages and then some.
Biden personally led the effort to give China permanent, most favored nation status, which is a tremendous advantage for a country to have. Few countries have it. But the United States doesn't have it. Never did. Probably never even asked for it, because they didn't know what they were doing.
As Vice President, Biden was a leading advocate of the Paris climate accord, which was unbelievably expensive to our country. It would have crushed American manufacturers while allowing China to pollute the atmosphere with impunity. Yet one more gift from Biden to the Chinese Communist Party. They took all of the advantage away from us. They took everything away. They don't have oil. We would have had to close up tremendous amounts of our energy to qualify, eventually, not too far into the future. We would've had to do things that would have been unbelievably destructive to our country, including the possible closing of 25 percent of our businesses. Think of that. And it was going to cost us hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars for the privilege of being involved in the Paris climate accord.
And you just have to look at what took place this year in Paris and France, where money was being sent to countries all over the world, and the people of France didn't want to take it, and they didn't, and they did a lot of rioting. They had their taxes raised. We would have had to raise our taxes. And it was a disaster. I've been given a lot of credit for what I did there. It took a certain amount of courage, I guess, because it sounds so nice—the Paris climate accord—but it wasn't good for us at all.
America lost nearly 10,000 factories while Joe Biden was Vice President. Think of that: 10,000 factories. He wrote something today, and he made a statement today that I wrote down. It's pretty accurate.
So Biden was here for 47 years. Eight years—the last 8 years, not long ago—as Vice President, he said, ""One in 5 miles of our highways are still in poor condition."" Well, we're doing a good job on highways, but why didn't he fix them 3 years ago? Why didn't he fix them?
""Tens of thousands of bridges are in disrepair and on the verge of collapse."" Well, it's probably not a right number, but we have bridges that should have been fixed. Why didn't he fix them? He was there for 8 years with President Obama. Why didn't they fix them? Tens of thousands of bridges. This is what he wrote: ""High-speed broadband. We want high-speed broadband."" Well why didn't he get it? Three years ago, it's not a long time.
And he didn't do any of the things, but now he says he's going to be President, and, as President, he's going to do all the things that he didn't do. He never did anything, except make very bad decisions, especially on foreign policy.
So Joe Biden and President Obama freely allowed China to pillage our factories, plunder our communities, and steal our most precious secrets. And I've stopped it largely, but I've stopped it. And it wasn't easy, because you talk about a certain power of the telephone and the calls, where they would call and say, ""No, we don't want to do that."" And other countries would call on behalf of China. But I did it. I did what has to be done. And you just take a look at what's gone on. And take a look at the kind of—at the numbers where they devalued their currency in order to pay the tariffs.
Now the Democrat Party is calling for defunding of our military. Think of that: defunding. They want to defund our military when China is building a massive military. They're building a massive military, and Biden wants to defund our military. And the world needs American strength right now more than ever, and we've got it.
We've got now, soon—as it—all this equipment comes in, all made in the U.S.A.—we've got the newest, most incredible weapons anywhere in the world. We have the best tanks, the best ships, the best missiles, rockets. We have the best of everything. We have the best fighter jets—the F-35, the F-18. All of these assets are being built. Tankers—incredible tankers. Bombers. Hope we don't have to use them, but we have the most incredible military.
When I came in, the military was totally depleted. It was at a level that was just absolutely incredible. And you know the statements. I made the statements before I told you what generals told me about our military. And I'll make them again. If somebody needs them, we'll give them to you. Very well documented. As Vice President, Biden opposed tariffs, and he was standing up for China. He didn't want to do anything to disrupt the relationship with China, even though China was taking us to the cleaners. He opposed my very strict travel ban on Chinese nationals to stop the spread of the China virus. He was totally against it. ""Xenophobic,"" he called me. ""Xenophobic."" A month later, he admitted I was right.
We would have had thousands of people additionally die if we let people come in from heavily infected China. But we stopped it; we did a travel ban in January. Nancy Pelosi was dancing on the streets of Chinatown in San Francisco a month later and even later than that and others too. They all thought what I did was a terrible mistake.
We would have lost—in fact, Dr. Fauci said you would have lost thousands of additional people if President Trump had to do that. And I was a crowd of one, because even experts didn't want to do it. They thought it was a mistake. And then, I did Europe when I started seeing what was going on in Italy and Spain and France and other countries in Europe. I did a ban on people coming in from Europe. That would have been disastrous for our country also.
And we saved tens of thousands of lives, but we actually saved millions of lives by closing—by closing up, we saved millions, potentially millions of lives. Could be—a number that we're actually working on—but it could be 2 to 3 million lives. So we're at 135,000, which is terrible; one is too much. But we would have had millions of people dead from this curse that came at us.
But we did what we had to do, and now we'll put out the flames as it happens. We have to get the schools open. We have to get everything open. A lot of people don't want to do that for political reasons, not for other reasons.
But if we had listened to Joe Biden, hundreds of thousands of additional lives would have been lost. And if you look at the job he did on swine flu—I looked at a poll—they have polls on everything nowadays—and he—they got very bad marks on the job they did on the swine flu, H1N1. He calls it ""N1H1."" H1N1. He got very poor marks from Gallup on the job they did on swine flu. And they stopped, very early on, testing. They totally stopped it. They just said, ""Stop.""
And frankly, if we didn't test, you wouldn't have all the headlines, because we're showing cases. And we have just about the lowest mortality rate. But if we did—think of this: If we didn't do testing—instead of testing over 40 million people, if we did half the testing, we would have half the cases. If we did another—you cut that in half, we would have, yet again, half of that.
But the headlines are always: ""Testing."" Now, the testing is a good thing, but at the same time, it's fodder for the fake news to report cases. So we're doing 40 million-plus, going to be very close to 45 million people. And when I turn on the news, I see, ""cases, cases, cases."" They don't talk about deaths being cut down to a level that—actually, ""tenfold,"" they use. I got that from one of the very respected media outlets—""tenfold."" Cut tenfold. Yes, but they don't talk about that; they talk about cases. And the cases are created because of the fact that we do tremendous testing. We have the best testing in the world.
We now make ventilators for the world. We had very few ventilators. There wasn't one person in any hospital anywhere in this country that needed a ventilator that didn't get it. And that was because we mobilized to a level—using the purchasing act, in some cases—we mobilized to a level that nobody thought possible.
Nothing has happened like that since World War II. Our Task Force has done a great job. Mike Pence worked so hard and gets so little credit. Sad to see that, actually. But he works so hard, and gets so little credit. The Governors would tell us—we'd be on the phone with 50 different Governors; they'd all tell us what a great job—""Great job."" And then, they'll go to the media and say, ""Well, they didn't do such a good job."" Well, we did a great job.
We made a lot of Governors look fantastic. We did in New York—what we did in New York was one of the most incredible things: 2,800 beds in Javits Center, but the Governor used very few of them, unfortunately. Then, we moved in our great hospital ships, one of our two great. We moved one also to Los Angeles.
And we could have used that for our senior citizens. We could have used it for other people. They could have used it instead of sending our seniors back into nursing homes that were infected, where you lost thousands of people. Thousands of people in New York died because of poor management by the Governor. And it's a very sad thing to see and very sad to watch and very sad to look at those statistics.
But we have an incredible Javits Center that we built with thousands of beds. I think it was 2,800, all ready to go. And they could have sent people there, or they could have sent senior citizens there instead of sending them into the nursing homes. And after all of that work and getting it done, the Army Corps of Engineers—I mean, the job they did was incredible. They built it in a matter of days.
When it was all completed—FEMA, everybody was there—doctors. We ended up getting doctors. They said, ""We can't man it."" I said, ""So we'll man it and woman it."" And that's what we did. We brought in doctors, nurses, everything. We're all set. We said, ""Where are the people?"" They didn't send the people. Very few people came in. They could have sent them into the Javits Center. They could have sent them to the hospital ship, which was virtually unused, but we were there.
By contrast, my administration acted very early to ban travel from China, from Europe, saving all of these lives. Incredible. And I want everyone to know, I want every citizen know that we're using the full power of the Federal Government to fight the China virus and to keep our people safe.
Through Operation Warp Speed, we will deliver a vaccine in record-breaking time. We're doing very well on the vaccines. We have many, many different vaccines being studied right now, many of which are looking really good. And we're ready to distribute the vaccine when we get it. We're all set. Taking a risk—an economic risk—of preparing for delivery, because we feel very certain it's going to be there. But logistically, we have our military ready to go. We have generals that that's all they do is distribute things, and they're going to be distributing, hopefully, a vaccine or a therapeutic, and it's coming out really well. And I think you're going to have some good news very, very quickly having to do with the vaccines.
We're also working with many other countries on the vaccine. Many countries are working with us. We're unleashing our Nation's scientific genius to kill the virus.
Joe Biden didn't just side with China on the virus—he did; he called me, again, ""xenophobic."" That's what he said. You all heard it many times. He described the rise of China as, quote, ""a very positive development."" It's not a positive development, not for us, it's not. He said that the idea that China is our competition is ""really bizarre."" He's really bizarre.
He said China is ""not a problem."" No, nobody's ripped us off more than China over the last 25, 30 years. Nobody close. And he says China is ""not a problem."" Now he takes it all back now. Now he wants to be Mr. Tough Guy. But for years—47 years—he never came out against China, never said anything bad. Just the opposite.
His son walked out with $1.5 billion of money to invest, where he'll make hundreds of thousands of dollars—maybe millions of dollars a year. Walked out with $1.5 billion. I asked one of the biggest people on Wall Street—maybe the biggest—""Is that possible?"" He said, ""No."" He's never seen it. They don't do that.
But Hunter—where's Hunter? Where is Hunter, by the way? Hunter Biden walked out with $1.5 billion. In Ukraine, he got $83,000 a month and, I guess, an up-front payment of $3 million. So he went from not having a job to getting $83,000 a month, with a lot of money paid up front to work for Burisma. And you all know about Burisma, but nothing happens. Nobody cares. And he was unemployed, as you know. He was unfortunately forced to leave the military. He was forced to leave. Didn't have a job, and all of a sudden, he's making a fortune. But nobody talks about that.
Indeed, Biden expressed more fawning praise about China on an ordinary day than about America on the Fourth of July. The last Independence Day, Biden attacked the United States and said we had, quote, ""never lived up to"" the ideals of our fathers, our forefathers, or our Founding Fathers—those founding ideals. And yet he enthusiastically stated that China is a ""great nation"" and we should hope for its ""continued expansion.""
Well, we all wish well to China, but what China has unleashed on the world, it's hard to even fathom. I see people now, friends of mine, they walk up, they want to say hello, and they have to keep their distance, and they're all covered up, like you're all covered up, with facemasks. It's a different world, but we're coming out on top.
Biden sides with China over America time and time again. And he said, on the Fourth of July, ""American history is no fairy tale"" and yet blindly celebrates China, saying, ""few . . . nations in history have come so far, so fast."" He's so proud of them. He's so proud of them.
Now Joe Biden is pushing a platform that would demolish the U.S. economy, totally demolish it.
So we built the greatest economy in the history of our country, greatest in the history of the world. That was a few months ago. Best unemployment numbers ever. Best for African American, Asian American, Hispanic American. Best for women. Best for everybody. Best for young people that didn't have a high school diploma, didn't have a college diploma. If they had a diploma, they were really in good shape. We built the greatest ever stock market, highest ever in history. We had 143 days of alltime stock market highs in just less than 3½ years.
And we had to close it down—because we did the right thing by doing that. As I said, we saved millions of lives. But China was saying, ""This is incredible what's going on."" China was, for the first time, respecting the United States. And now they want to do something that's much different: Joe Biden.
So I've watched this, and I've watched it with great interest. We're building our economy again. I guess the stock market went up almost 500 points today or something thereabouts. You'll check. But it was up a lot when I left. And our economy is coming back. We're almost at a level where—even though it's long before the very important—maybe the most important ever—election of November 3. But long before that—but we're close to record stock markets again. And NASDAQ hit an alltime high for the 16th time. Think of that: for the 16th time—over the last month or so, for the 16th time. So one of our markets already hit an alltime high.
Today Joe Biden gave a speech in which he said that the core of his economic agenda is a hard-left crusade against American energy. He wants to kill American energy. He wants to reenter the unfair, one-sided Paris climate accord—which will destroy us—at the expense of many other nations who benefit. It was actually drawn, in my opinion, to take advantage of the United States, just like so many other deals that are done to take advantage of the fools running the United States. But this would do nothing for the environment, but would cripple American industry while greatly helping China.
He wants to impose massive energy taxes and job-crushing mandates to eliminate carbon from the United States economy—let him define the word ""carbon,"" because he won't be able to—obliterating American oil, clean coal, natural gas, and the natural energy resources that supply countless American jobs.
Joe Biden put A.O.C., a young woman not talented, in many ways, in charge of his energy plan and the environment. Essentially, her and Bernie Sanders—who ran a lot of times for President, never made it. Good base, but that's about it. In other words, he wants to impose the Green New Deal on our country.
When I first saw the Green New Deal, I thought it was a joke. I said, ""This will never go anywhere."" Now they're trying to impose it. This will destroy our country and make us noncompetitive with other countries.
Don't forget we're in competition with China and with many other countries throughout the world. We're in tremendous economic competition, including Europe, which has never treated us well. The European Union was formed in order to take advantage of the United States. They formed, and they take advantage of the United States. And I know that, and they know I know that, but other Presidents had no idea.
Last week, Joe Biden released his unity platform, developed with Socialist Bernie Sanders, describing what he would do if elected President. The Biden-Sanders agenda is the most extreme platform of any major party nominee, by far, in American history. I think it's worse than, actually, Bernie's platform; it's gone so far right. And he's doing that because he's begging for their vote.
But one of the things I just asked my people to do is just draw up for me, just quickly, some of the things that we've been hearing about over the last couple of weeks. And these are actual key elements of the Biden-Sanders unity platform: Abolish immigration detention. No more detention. You come in here illegally, no more detention.
Stop all deportation. So if we get a MS-13 gang member, which we've taken out of our country by the thousands—brought them back to Honduras, Guatemala—can't do that anymore—El Salvador. Can't do that anymore. Stop all deportations. So, in other words, we'll take all of these people—many of whom are in prison for rape, murder, lots of other things.
End prosecution of illegal border crossers. Oh, okay, they come in illegally, and we have to stop the whole process. Support the deadly sanctuary cities where many of these people are protected better than the American citizen is protected.
Incentivize illegal-alien child smuggling. Give it an incentive. Because if you look at what they're saying, that's exactly what they do: incentivize illegal-alien child smuggling. They're incentivized by what this plan calls for.
Expand asylum for all new illegal aliens. How about that one? All new illegal aliens, expand asylum. Cancel all asylum cooperation agreements in the Western Hemisphere. Well, we have agreements with Honduras, Guatemala, with El Salvador. We have great agreements, where, when Biden and Obama used to bring killers out, they would say: ""Don't bring them back to our country. We don't want them."" ""Well, we have to."" We don't want them; they wouldn't take them. Now, with us, they take them. Someday, I'll tell you why. Someday, I'll tell you why. But they take them, and they take them very gladly.
They used to bring them out, and they wouldn't even let the airplanes land if they brought them back by airplanes. They wouldn't let the buses into their country. They said, ""We don't want them."" I said, ""No, but they entered our country illegally."" And they're murderers; they're killers, in some cases. And they said, ""Nope, we don't want them."" They'd turn the bus around, they'd turn the plane around, and they'd land in the United States, and who knows what happened to them, but it wasn't good.
Taxpayer-funded lawyers will be given to all illegal aliens. So we're going to pay now for the lawyers' lobby. And we're going to give all illegal aliens taxpayer-funded lawyers. How does that sound? Pretty good? In other words: Come in here illegally. We're going to give you a free legal advice. We'll take you up to the Supreme Court as much as possible.
Abolish immigration enforcement against illegal workers. Think of that: Abolish immigration enforcement. They're going to abolish immigration enforcement. Well, basically, as you know, what they're going to do is, they're going to rip down the wall. They're taking it down. They want to take down the wall, which we fought hard for: up to 259 miles right now of great, powerful wall that's really working, because, if you look at the numbers, in addition to the fact that Mexico, for various reasons, has 27,000 soldiers on our southern border to keep people out of our country—and I appreciate it.
We had a great meeting last week with the President of Mexico. Great guy. Friend of mine—become a friend of mine. A lot of people thought that couldn't happen, because we're very opposite, in terms of our views, maybe even in terms of our temperament. But he is a great guy, and he's a friend of mine, and they've been terrific. Mexico has been terrific. Twenty-seven thousand soldiers on our border, Mexican soldiers. And we have great, great numbers.
We got rid of so many different things: Catch-and-release is gone. So many different things have taken place. We used to catch them, take their name, and release them into our country. We don't do that anymore. We now release them back where they came from. Sometimes, we'll bring them back to their country.
Grant work permits for illegal aliens. So if you come in illegally, you get a work permit. People that live here don't get work permits, in many cases. Provide taxpayer subsidies and welfare for illegal aliens and new immigrants. So we want to provide taxpayer subsidies and welfare for people that come into our country illegally, illegal immigrants. They want government health care for all illegal aliens.
This is part of their plan. I'm not making this up. This is all down in their plan from last week. And this is good, compared to what I heard today.
Federal student aid and free community college for illegal aliens. What do you think about that? Federal student aid and free community college. We're going to have every person in the world pouring into our country from all over the world.
And by the way, the wall was so timely, because it stopped people coming in from heavily infected areas of Mexico. If we had that, we would be in trouble like you wouldn't believe. You wouldn't believe.
And remember, cases is different than deaths. And cases we give you, because our testing is the best in the world. And by the way, by far, the most: 45 million. Find out which country tested 45 million people. If China, if Russia, if India tested 45 million people or if they did tests like we did, check out how many cases they'd have.
But it's still—we've done a great job; get no credit for it. And I don't want the credit. ","I want the people that have done this great job—the people that have done such an incredible job on building the ventilators and doing the testing and building a testing platform that's been amazing. We have many platforms. Many companies have come up with different forms of tests. When we started, there was no such thing. Sign new immigrants up for welfare immediately. This is Joe Biden. So they walk off, and they come in, and they put a foot into our land, and we sign up new immigrants up for welfare. We sign them up immediately. They get welfare benefits. United States citizens don't get what they're looking to give illegal immigrants. Think of that: sign up—it's hard to believe I'm even reading that—new immigrants for welfare immediately. Not to mention the cost of this, which is incalculable. The cost of this is so crazy.
End requirement for immigrants' self-sufficiency and maximize their welfare. Now, this is us writing this. Who's not coming to the United States? Every person from South America is going to pour in, and every person from other countries, they're going to be pouring in. End requirement—think of that—for immigrant self-sufficiency and, remember, to maximize welfare. So we're giving them maximum.
Then, we have massively expand immigration during a global pandemic, taking jobs from unemployed Americans.
End all travel bans, including from jihadist regions. So now we have travel bans; a lot of you said I didn't get the travel ban, and you were wrong. We got the travel ban. We lost in the Ninth Circuit, we lost again in the Ninth Circuit, and then we won in the Supreme Court. We have a very strong travel ban. And we don't want people that are going to come in and blow up our cities, do things. And frankly, with the liberal Democrats running the cities that we do have, where they do have problems, maybe they wouldn't mind. But I would mind, and the people of this country mind.
So listen to this: End all travel bans. He's talking about the ban that I won that everybody said I didn't win. They said I didn't win because in the lower court we lost. Then, we lost in the appellate division, and then we won in the Supreme Court. So they said, ""He lost."" And they're right, at the lower level. But, in the meantime, we won in the Supreme Court. So it's in effect, but they didn't say that. They said, ""He lost,"" which again, is fake news, but that's the way they do it.
So end all travel bans, including from jihadist regions. They specified that.
Grant mass amnesty. Everybody gets amnesty. Mass amnesty. Think of that. And this says: Create a roadmap to citizenship for massive, massive numbers.
And we're not talking about DACA, because I'm going to take care of DACA, much better than the Democrats did. The Democrats had their chance, and they blew it. But we're going to take care of DACA, because I'm going to be doing, in the not-too-distant future, pretty soon, I'm going to be signing a new immigration action, very, very big merit-based immigration action that, based on the DACA decision, I'll be able to do.
Vastly expand low-skilled immigration to the United States. So they want a lot of people come in with low skills; I like merit. Think of that: Vastly expand low-skilled immigration to the United States. These are the things that are in the plan. This is Biden. Biden has gone radical left.
Increase refugee admissions by 700 percent. Huh. That's a lot: by 700 percent. Nobody has ever heard of such a thing. Increase refugee admissions by 700 percent.
Abolish law enforcement as we know it. I think the police do an incredible job in this country. And you're going to have a rogue, terrible cop, on occasion, like you do in any industry, in any business, in any profession. But I think they do an incredible job. Abolish law enforcement as we know it.
End cash bail. No bail. Just, we let you right out. Look at what's happened to New York: Crime is up, shootings are up at numbers that nobody's ever seen before. Look at Chicago. What a disaster. And we're waiting for them to call us, because we're all set to go. We have the FBI. We have Homeland Security. We have everybody ready to go. We have the National Guard. They're all ready to go. End cash bail, releasing dangerous criminals onto our streets. Cash bail. New York just did that. Other places have done it. They haven't turned out to good.
Abolish completely the death penalty. And I know there's a lot of debate on the death penalty, and there has been for a long time, but sometimes, you use the death penalty, depending on the crime. You know what happened today with regard to the death penalty.
Appoint social justice prosecutors in order to free violent criminals. So they want to appoint social justice prosecutors to free violent criminals.
End mandatory minimums. And that's by empowering judges to determine appropriate sentences by fighting to repeal mandatory minimums at the Federal level and give States incentives to repeal their mandatory minimums.
We could go on for days. Incentivize prison closure. So they want to close our prisons. They now want to abolish—they want to abolish our police departments. They want to abolish our prisons, I guess. Incentivize jail and prison closures as populations decline.
Ensure the resources saved are invested directly into those communities. So they want to close them, rather than have them for some very bad people, people that are not going to behave when they get out. You see that in New York; they allowed a lot of criminals out, and those criminals are causing havoc. And then, they got rid of their incredible and legendary crime squad. And bad things are happening in New York. Bad things are happening. I love New York. I hate to see what's going on.
End solitary confinement. Free Federal housing for former inmates. So Federal housing now can go to inmates—former inmates.
Rejoin Paris climate accord, and seek an even higher level of restrictions. Oh, I didn't notice that. Oh, I see. So they want to rejoin the Paris climate accord, and they want to seek an even higher level of restraint. In other words, make it worse than it was.
Mandate net-zero carbon emissions for homes, offices, and all new buildings by 2030. That basically means no windows, no nothing. It's very hard to do. I tell people when they want to go into some of these buildings: ""How are your eyes? Because they won't be good in 5 years. And I hope you don't mind cold office space in the winter and warm office space in the summer, because your air conditioning is not the same as the good old days.""
Mandate zero carbon emissions from power plants by 2035. Zero. We're talking about zero. Nothing can go in the air. Mandate net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. And I believe he's changing that. He's bringing it down. He wants no petroleum product. He wants no oil or gas. I don't think Texas is going to do too well. They're going to get rid of about 7 million jobs if you go by the Biden plan. I don't think that Oklahoma, North Dakota, Pennsylvania are going to be too happy with that—and many other States—Ohio.
Mandate all 500,000 school buses and all 3 million Government vehicles be changed to zero-emission vehicles within 5 years. I've heard it worse than that. Install 500,000 taxpayer-funded charging stations nationwide.
Here's a bad one, really bad one: End school choice. There is nothing that the African American community wants more than school choice. And mothers and fathers are going to be very happy to see him be defeated just on that alone: End school choice. So Joe Biden wants to end school choice.
End tax credit scholarships serving disadvantaged students in 26 States. Oppose 14 million Americans with education savings accounts and get rid of school choice, having to do with school choice. Eliminate school choice in Washington, DC. You know what they've done in Washington. They have some incredible example right here. Example—I know of one example. I think they have a number of them, but one is incredible.
Abolish all charter schools. Charter schools are doing great. Ban funding for charter schools in poor neighborhoods. ""We don't want charter schools in poor neighborhoods."" Well, that's not fair. Abolish educational standards.
Abolish—in the suburbs, you're going to abolish the suburbs with this. Enforce Obama-Biden's radical AFFH—that's the AFFH regulation that threatens to strip localities of Federal affordable housing funds unless they change their zoning laws to fit the Federal Government's demands. So what you have—I mean, I've been watching this for years in Westchester, coming from New York. They want low-income housing built in a neighborhood.
Well, I'm ending that rule. I'm taking it out, so—I had spoke with Ben Carson the other day. We're going to be taking it out. I've watched that whole thing go, and now they want to make it twice as bad in the suburbs—in the suburbs.
Mothers aren't happy about that. Fathers aren't happy about that. They worked hard to buy a house, and now they're going to watch the housing values drop like a rock, and that has happened. It dropped like a rock. So we're not going to do that; we're going to do the exact opposite.
Probably, there has never been a time—and this is just a few—this is—it's much worse than that. We did this very quickly. It's probably never been a time when candidates are so different. We want law and order; they don't want law and order. We want strong, closed borders with people able to come in through merit, through a legal process; they don't want to have any borders at all.
They're going to rip down the wall. It was hard to get that built. And now it's almost completed. It'll be completed by a little after the end of the year, and they want to rip it down. And it's had such an impact. It's incredible. It stops trafficking—human trafficking—of women and children, but women, mostly.
Human trafficking: one of the worst things ever, all at a level that has never been at because of the internet. You wouldn't think—you think of it as an ancient statement. You wouldn't think that's possible today, but it's human trafficking of women and children. And they want to let that go and continue.
The wall has stopped it so much because they will go over to a section where there aren't people—not an entry point—and they'll make a left into the United States. And they're on their way. They can't do that anymore. We have a 30-foot wall that goes 6 feet into the ground. It stops a lot of the tunneling, because they're pretty good at tunnels. But we watch the tunnels, and we have equipment for that. But you can't make a left anymore and come into the United States loaded up with human traffic.
So they want to take down the wall. They want to have open borders. Think of open borders today though, with the pandemic. I mean, the timing is sort of interesting, but—with the pandemic.
So there's never been a time when two candidates were so different. I mean, I've seen races where it's like the same exact platforms. I'm even talking about essentially Democrat, Republican. There's not that much difference. There's a little difference, but there's not much. You choose one because you like the way they look, you like the way they sound, you like the way they talk. You like something about one, and you don't like the other. But there's—you know, there's never been a difference.
Here's one of the greatest difference—this is without question the single biggest difference: If you want law and order—for instance, I enacted recently, when I saw what was going on with Federal monuments—we don't have the right to do States, although we're going—we're trying to find it. But with the monuments, where they wanted to rip down Andrew Jackson, they wanted to rip down George Washington. They were actually heading over to the Jefferson Memorial, if you can believe that. But this has been going on, and I found an act that we've used. And we have many, many people in jail right now—many, many people in jail, all over the country—because they tried to destroy or, in some cases, got it down, a Federal statue or monument.
We haven't had anybody making a move since I enacted this. I signed an Executive order a couple of weeks ago, and it says very simply, ""Ten years in jail."" You do it, 10 years in jail. The amazing part is we're able to catch everybody because, thanks to all of you on television—we appreciate it—but we have their pictures. We have the man standing on Andrew Jackson's horse. We have the man standing by General George Washington. We have everybody standing—you know, they were going to go for the Emancipation Proclamation, Abraham Lincoln, standing with a young man who was being freed. And we said: ""We're going to do something. We can't let this happen.""
Now, it could be removed at some point. You go through a process, a legal process, go through Congress, whatever. I understand that. At the same time, some people like these statues and monuments. But it can be removed, but you have to go through a legal process.
So they were going to have 20- to 25,000 people that night; nobody showed up. Nobody. You know that, because you were disappointed to see that. The next night, I believe, 22 people showed up. They said, ""We're going to make it Friday night instead,"" and 22 people showed up. Four were actually arrested because we have pictures of them knocking down other statues. So they're in jail now.
So there has never been an election where we've had this kind of difference. We want strong borders. Without borders—you've heard me say it 1,000 times—without borders, you don't have a country. They don't want to have borders; they want to have open borders. It's radical left, and it will destroy our country.
Twenty years ago, Venezuela was a very rich country—one of the richest, one of the richest anywhere. Per capita, one of the richest. Tremendous oil reserves. Now they don't have water. They don't have food. They don't have medicine. We do everything we can to take care of the people, but they have nothing. And that's exactly the ideology that you have going over here. If I wasn't there to stop it, if I wasn't here to say, ""No way, that's not going to happen,"" we'd be in some mess. We'd be in some mess.
And Pelosi and Schumer and Bernie and Joe, they'll never stop it. They don't have the power, the strength to stop it. It's beyond them. But we do.
So there's never been a time like this, where you've had an election of people so different.
Okay, a couple of questions. Yes, please, go ahead.
2020 Presidential Election/National Economy/Absentee Voting Policies 
Q. Sir, you just spent the better part of an hour explaining why American should choose you and not your opponent. Yesterday, you said on Twitter, ""Be careful what you wish for!"" I guess the question is: Do you see yourself as the underdog in this race? Do you see yourself losing in the fall?
The President. No, I don't. I think we have a really good poll numbers. They're not suppression polls; they're real polls. You look at the Intracostal in Florida. You look at the lakes. You see thousands of boats with Trump signs, American signs. You've got the Trump-Pence sign all over. You look at what's going on. You look at bikers, for miles and miles, riding up highways proudly with their signs.
I have—look, we won a race where it was the same thing: 2016. We had polls that were fake. They turned out to be fake. Not all—a couple of them got it right. Three of them, to be exact. Three of them. One of them was unsuspecting, but they got it right. They were very proud of it.
But we had, in 2016, something even more so, but we got in, and we had 306 to, I guess, 223, which was a tremendous margin of difference. You remember, they all said, ""He cannot get to 270.""
I went to Maine a number of times, where we just freed up lobster fishing and fishing. Just—they took away 5,000 square miles from Maine. I just opened it up. And I just got rid of tariffs in China. And we're working on European Union, which charge our fishermen tariffs. And I said, ""You're not going to do that."" So we freed it up for Maine.
But if you take a look, we went up there recently. There were crowds. Thousands of people lined up going over to a factory where we were opening up for—we're making swabs. A beautiful, big, new factory, making swabs.
I think that the enthusiasm now is greater—and maybe far greater—than it was in 2016. I think a lot of people don't want to talk about it. I think they're not going to say: ""Hey, I'm for Trump. I'm for Trump."" They don't want to go through the process. And I fully understand that, because the process is not fair. The media doesn't treat us fairly. They never have, and perhaps they never will. But maybe they will when we turn this around for a second time. And it's going to happen very quickly. When we turn it around for a second time, maybe they will.
I think we're doing very well in the polls. And I think you have a silent majority the likes of which this country has never seen before. This is a very important election. We've done a great job. We had to turn it off, as I said. Turn it off. And now we've started it again.
As you know, they announced 2 weeks ago, record job numbers: almost 5 million people. And that beat the last month, which was also a record: 2.8 million people. Nobody's ever done what we've done, and now we're doing it twice.
And I think by election day, you're going to see some incredible numbers. The third quarter is going to be really good. Fourth quarter is going to be great. But next year is going to be one of the best economic years. So hopefully, I'll be able to be the President where we say, ""Look at the great job I did.""
Q. [Inaudible]—at this point?
The President. I think, great. I think we have a great chance. I think we're going to have a lot of people show up. I'm very worried about mail-in voting, because I think it's subject to tremendous fraud and being rigged. You see that Paterson, New Jersey, where—I believe it was 20 percent of the vote was fraudulent. It was—all sorts of things happened. I understand a mailman was recently indicted someplace for playing games with the mail-in ballots.
You'll have tremendous fraud if you do these mail-in ballots. Now, absentee ballots are okay, because absentee ballots—you have to get applications. You have to go through a process. If I'm here and I vote in Florida, you get an absentee ballot, but you have to go through a process. Absentee ballots are great.
But mail-in voting—where a Governor mails millions of ballots to people all over the State—California—millions and millions of ballots, as an example—and then they come back; they don't come back. Who got them? Did you forget to send them to a Republican area or a Democrat area, I guess you could say?
But if you take a look at all of the unbelievable fraud that's been involved with mail-in voting over the last—even a short period of while—but look at Paterson, New Jersey. It was a massive error and a massive miscalculation, and there was incredible fraud. Look at the city council, what's happened to it. This is one place, but you have many places, and they're all over.
Yes, please.
China-U.S. Relations 
Q. Thank you, sir. I wanted to know: When's the last time you spoke with President Xi of China? And do you plan to speak with him in the near future?
The President. No, I haven't spoken to him. No, I don't; I have no plan to speak to him.
Yes, please.
Q. And, sir, as a follow-up—one follow-up?
Q. Thank you so—do you want to do a follow-up? Or——
Q. Yes, if you don't mind.
Q. Okay, yes. Is it okay?
The President. Yes, go ahead.
Supreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
Q. I just wanted to—Ruth Bader Ginsburg was hospitalized today with an infection. I wanted to know if you had any reaction to that news?
The President. No, I wish her the best. I hope she's better. I didn't hear that, actually. She was just hospitalized? No, that's too bad. No, I wish her the best.
Q. Okay.
The President. She's actually given me some good rulings. Okay? So you know that, right? People were surprised. No, I wish her the absolute best.
Please.
Restrictions on Travel From Europe to the U.S./Border Security/Law Enforcement Funding/U.S. Military Strength 
Q. Okay. Thank you, Mr. President. So you were mentioning the travel bans. And I wonder: When do you plan to review that? Because the European countries—the situation is under control—much are better place than the U.S. And there is no ban for other hotspots like Russia and India. So what will be the criteria to change that? And another question——
The President. Well, you know, we've banned for Europe, and at some point, that will come off. And we're dealing with them all the time. The relationship is very good; they just don't treat us very well on trade. They are—they have been very unfair to us over many, many decades. And we're doing that. It's very easy to solve. I was all set to solve it actually, and then we got hit with the plague.
But we have a travel ban on various countries, and that travel ban remains until such time as we say it doesn't remain.
Q. And Mr. President—— The President. We want our country safe. We don't—unlike Biden, we don't want to have criminals pouring into our country. We don't want to have open borders. We're not going to have that. And we want to take care of our police. We want to actually fund our police, not defund them. And we're not going to abolish our police. And we're not going to make our military small and weak, because probably—or, at least, at top of the level, we need our military right now.
Yes, go ahead. Please.
Trade 
Q. Mr. President, so how do you think that ""America first"" policy can work during a pandemic? Aren't you concerned that this could actually damage the U.S. and make China more influence around the world?
The President. Okay, look, my policy is America first. We've lost hundreds of billions of dollars a year with China and many other countries. And what we're doing is just handing everybody everything. It's just a sad—I've watched it, I've looked at it.
We did the U.S.-Mexico—you saw that, USMCA. We made a very fair deal on trade. We had the worst deal ever, right? You know that. We had the worst deal ever, and it replaced that; it replaced that horrible NAFTA deal. That was one of the worst trade deals ever made.
I'll tell you, the only deal that might be worse is the WTO, World Trade Organization. May be worse.
OAN, please.
China-U.S. Trade/Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Policy 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Your administration has taken tangible steps to ensure that Chinese companies are not taking advantage of our U.S. stock markets, our——
The President. It's true.
Q. ——our trade. Last week, your administration sent a letter to the Railroad Retirement Board, asking them to reconsider investments in Chinese defense fund—firms.
The President. Meaning ""not to invest""?
Q. Correct.
The President. That's correct.
Q. So where is that request now? And are you taking tangible actions to ensure that U.S. investments don't continue to fund——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——defense firms in China?
The President. Yes, and you'll see more coming. This was a very important bill that we signed. But you're going to see more coming over the next short period of time. But yes, we don't want them investing in Chinese military companies. Okay?
Q. [Inaudible]—letters, I mean, what actions can be taken to ensure that does not happen?
The President. Well, you have a lot of actions we can take, including the—including the increase. You know, right now people don't know: China is paying a lot of tariffs. We made a China deal, and they bought just—I think the third highest amount of corn ever in our—in world history. They just bought from us the highest amount, which is great for our farmers. But I view it differently than I did before I made the deal. When I made the deal, I thought this was a great deal. After what happened to us—what happened to the world, coming from China—I view it much differently. But we can impose massive tariffs on China if we want—and other countries, if we want. And we'll see. We just want to be treated fairly. We want a level playing field. Our farmers were never treated properly by anybody, and they were targeted by China.
You know, I paid our farmers $28 billion over a 2-year period because they were targeted to that amount of money—to that exact amount of money: $28 [billion]*. It was $16 billion, and it was $12 billion—$28 [billion]* over a 2-year period. And we gave $28 billion to our farmers. That's why they're all here.
And now they're doing very well. Our farmers are doing very well because we made really great trade deals. USMCA just kicked in. The China deal, they're buying a lot. They are buying a lot. I will say that: They're buying a lot. A lot of people ask, ""How are they doing on the trade deal?"" They're buying a lot.
So I want to thank everybody, and we'll be having these conferences again.
I—we're going to be signing an immigration act very soon; it's going to be based on merit. It's going to be very strong. We're going to work on DACA because we want to make people happy. And I'll tell you, even conservative Republicans want to see something happen with DACA.
The Democrats had their chance for 3 years to do something with DACA, and they always turned it down. They always turned it down. They used it as politics. I'm using it to get something done.
But we'll be signing a very powerful immigration act. It will be great. It will be merit-based. The country has tried to get it for 25 or 30 years. It will be strong on the border, but you'll come in legally, and you'll be able to come in legally.
And very importantly, we'll be taking care of people from DACA in a very Republican way. A Republicans—I've spoken to many Republicans, and some would like to leave it out, but, really, they understand that it's the right thing to do.
So we're going to be taking care of DACA. We will be doing for DACA what the Democrats had a chance to do and they never did it. Okay?
Thank you all very much."
"July 21, 2020",The President's News Conference,Donald J. Trump,"Donald J. Trump, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/343067",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1243,"The President. Well, thank you very much, and good afternoon. Today I want to provide an update on our response to the China virus and what my administration is doing to get the outbreak in the Sun Belt under control. It seems largely in Sun Belt, but could be spreading.
My team is also working night and day with Capitol Hill to advance the next economic relief package. We're working very hard on it. We're making a lot of progress. I also know that both sides want to get it done. We'll call it ""phase four."" I think we're going to get it done. We'll protect our workers, our schools, and our families and protect them very strongly.
As one family, we mourn every precious life that's been lost. I pledge in their honor that we will develop a vaccine and we will defeat the virus. We're doing very well with vaccine development and therapeutic development. But I want to thank our brave doctors and nurses and frontline responders. The job they do is incredible, and they are truly brave.
My administration will stop at nothing to save lives and shield the vulnerable, which is so important. We've learned so much about this disease. And we know who the vulnerable are, and we are going to indeed shield them.
And again, the vaccines are coming, and they're coming a lot sooner than anyone thought possible, by years. If you look at the old system and look at the new system, I think by years.
The China virus is a vicious and dangerous illness, but we've learned a great deal about it and who it targets. We are in the process of developing a strategy that's going to be very, very powerful. We've developed them as we go along. Some areas of our country are doing very well; others are doing less well. It will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better, something I don't like saying about things, but that's the way it is. It's the way—it's what we have. If you look over the world, it's all over the world, and it tends to do that.
The Governors are working very, very hard, and we are supporting them 100 percent. Everything they need, they get. And we are taking good care. We have tremendous supplies and a great supply chain, whether it's ventilators or gowns or just about anything they need. So that's a big difference from inheriting very, very empty cupboards.
The median age of those who succumb to the China virus is 78 years old. Roughly half of all deaths have been individuals in nursing homes or in long-term care. In one study, 90 percent of those hospitalized had underlying medical conditions, whether it's heart or diabetes, but usually, it's some kind of a condition. It seems that people have that. And if they do, it's a problem, no question about it.
Young adults may often have mild or even no symptoms. They won't even know they're sick. They won't have any idea that they have a virus. They won't have any idea at all. America's youth will act responsibly, and we're asking everybody that when you are not able to socially distance, wear a mask, get a mask. Whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact. They'll have an effect. And we need everything we can get.
Data shows children have the lowest fatality risk; 99.96 percent of all virus fatalities are in adults. Think of that. So that's much, much, much less than 1 percent for children, young people.
By understanding these risk profiles and learning how to treat the disease, we've been able to greatly reduce mortality in the United States. In fact, we'll show you a chart and how well we do compared to the rest of the world. We have several treatments already available that significantly reduce the severity and duration of the disease, including remdesivir, which has been very successful and a widely available steroid treatment. And we have many more happening and coming out.
We've learned best practices for treatment of the virus at every stage and have shared these findings with medical providers, and we've shared them all over the world. But the relationship with other countries has been very strong. We're all working together. This includes ensuring all hospitals are aware of the importance of different approaches to oxygen treatment, including high-flow oxygen, the importance of steroid treatment for those on ventilators.
And when you're on a ventilator, we've learned a tremendous about the use of the ventilator. And at the beginning, people never had an experience like this, where we needed so many ventilators so fast, and even the use of the ventilators. But the doctors have become incredibly—and nurses and helpers have become incredibly good at the use of a ventilator, which is actually a very complicated procedure.
And allocating remdesivir to hospitals based on new admission since it works best early in hospitalization. And that's something that they've really started. They're using it much earlier. Fatalities nationwide have fallen 75 percent since mid-April. It's a great number.
As cases and fatalities rise in certain hard-hit States, which you're looking at right now, we're surging personnel, supplies, and therapeutics. We again have tremendous amounts of supplies. We are in very good shape, and we can move them quickly.
Our case fatality rate has continued to decline and is lower than the European Union and almost everywhere else in the world. If you watch American television, you'd think that the United States was the only country involved with and suffering from the China virus. Well, the world is suffering very badly. But the fact is that many countries are suffering very, very, very badly, and they've been suffering from this virus for a long time.
We've done much better than most. And with the fatality rate at a lower rate than most, it's something that we can talk about, but we're working, again, with them, because we're helping a lot of countries that people don't even know about. I get calls all the time asking for help, especially as it pertains to the ventilators. They need help with ventilators; they have to get them. They're very hard to get. We're making thousands now a month—thousands of ventilators a month. It's been quite amazing.
And we keep doing the good job, and things will get better and better. We'll be putting up charts behind me showing different statistics and different rates of success and, I guess you could say also, things that we can do better on. But you'll see them. There'll be put up as we go.
In April, the average age of individuals who tested positive for the virus was over 50 years old. Today, the average age is significantly younger. Hospital lengths of stay are almost half of what they were in April. So the stays are about half. The rate of cases requiring hospitalization has been reduced. And mortality among those admitted to the hospital is nearly one-half of what it was in April.
We've learned a lot. We've learned a lot about this disease, how to handle it. The doctors have learned a lot, not only in the use of the ventilators, but in many other things. And things are happening too, like the remdesivir and other elements, steroids, et cetera.
But these trends could change without our continued and relentless focus. And that's what we have: We have a relentless focus. And it's been that way from the beginning. But we have learned so much. As you know, in recent weeks we've seen a concerning rise in the cases in many parts of our South; you look at South, Southwest, and West. This growth in cases first began to appear in mid-June, primarily among 18- to 35-year-olds, many of whom were asymptomatic.
We're also facing the challenge of a significant spice [spike]* in virus cases across the rest of the Western Hemisphere, including Mexico. Mexico has been hit very, very, very hard. As you know, the President, a great gentleman, was here 2 weeks ago. And they have really been hit hard.
Because we've achieved a nearly fourfold increase in testing capacity in 2 months, we're successfully identifying more asymptomatic and mild cases: some cases so mild that you really don't even treat them; some cases with children, where they don't even know that they're ill. And I guess they're not very ill, because they recover almost immediately.
Per capita, the U.S. is conducting 50-percent more tests than Europe, and we've conducted nearly three times as many tests as all of the other countries in the Western Hemisphere combined. We'll be over 50 million tests. This allows us to isolate those who are infected, even those without symptoms. So we know exactly where it's going and when it's going to be there.
We're also working to reduce turnaround time. My administration has been aggressively responding to case growth in the Sun Belt, and we continue to do so, working very close with all Governors, but right now, in particular, those Governors.
We're coordinating closely with hospitals and Governors. In the last 3 weeks, I've sent senior officials into nine States to meet with Governors and provide recommendations to the various leaders of the State, including hospital administrators, et cetera.
My administration currently has zero unfilled requests for—unfulfilled requests for equipment or anything else that they need from the Governors. No Governor needs anything right now, and we think we'll have it that way until the end, because, frankly, we are stocked up and ready to go wherever we have to go.
We have nearly 7,000 National Guard and military medical personnel in Texas, California, Florida, and Arizona that's helping us greatly. I want to thank them very much. The military has been fantastic. We're closely monitoring hospital capacity in these States. Hospitals are open for elective surgeries and other procedures. So hospitals are open for elective surgeries.
We want Americans to get the medical treatments they need. All of the Governors we've spoken with say they have enough bed capacity. That's a great thing. Our initial shutdown was to prevent the overflow of our hospitals and to allow us to meet the demands caused by this global pandemic, including the ventilators.
And a permanent shutdown was really never an option. In terms of what we're doing right now, this would be completely unsustainable, produce debilitating economic fallback, and lead to catastrophic public health consequences. There are consequences to shutdowns.
And we've saved, potentially, millions of lives by doing the initial shutdown, but now we're very aware of this disease. We understand the disease, to a large extent. And nobody is going to maybe ever fully understand it, but we'll end up with a cure, we'll end up with therapeutics, we'll end up with a vaccine very soon—all three.
We're instead asking Americans to use masks, socially distance, and employ vigorous hygiene—wash your hands every chance you get—while sheltering high-risk populations. We are imploring young Americans to avoid packed bars and other crowded indoor gatherings. Be safe and be smart. We're surging testing capacity to identify and isolate cases. This includes a newly approved testing platform to nursing homes across the South. We're being very, very vigilant with respect to nursing homes, because you know all of the problems that we've had with so many people—so sadly, they were infected—so that all of the staff and residents can be routinely tested and isolated to ensure our elderly are even more strongly protected than anybody else. That's really the high-risk people—the high-risk, wonderful people.
Once this current surge in cases declines, the same testing platform will enable people to visit their loved ones after taking a test, which is a big difference. Ultimately, our goal is not merely to manage the pandemic, but to end it. We want to get rid of it as soon as we can. That is why getting a vaccine remains a top priority.
Two vaccine candidates are entering the final stage of clinical trials this month. This was achieved in record time. It used to be years before you were in a position like we are right now. Four other vaccines will enter final trials in the following weeks, and we're mass producing all of the top candidates so that the first approved vaccine will be available immediately.
And logistically, we have the military ready to go. We have great people—logistic, military people; a wonderful general who's waiting for the vaccine so they can distribute it in record time. That's what's going to happen. So our military is all set to go. We will deliver a vaccine, therapeutics, whatever it is that's necessary, and defeat the virus once and for all.
And I'll take a few questions if you'd like.
I will say this: I want to thank all of the staff: the White House staff, all of the doctors that we've been working with so closely. And it's—just a lot of very positive things are happening. It's a nasty, horrible disease that should have never been allowed to escape China, but it did. And it infected the world, and the world is suffering. But we're going to get it taken care of, and we're helping lots of other countries.

Frequency of the President's Coronavirus Tests 
Q. Mr. President, first, I just wanted to get a clarification. Your Press Secretary said today that you sometimes take more than one test a day. Why is that? And how often is that?
The President. Well, I didn't know about more than one. I do take probably, on average, a test every 2 days, 3 days. And I don't know of any time I've taken two tests in 1 day, but I could see that happening.
Coronavirus Testing Access 
Q. So Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have both said they want to see more money for testing. They want to send billions of dollars to the States so they can do more testing. And you probably saw Mick Mulvaney the other day said that his kids, it took them a week to get test results back. He said this is ""simply inexcusable"" given where we are in the pandemic. Do you think we have a problem with testing in this country right now? And are you in favor of more money for testing?
The President. Well, we've done more testing, by far, than anybody. Some of the tests—because it is massive volume—it takes longer. Others of the tests, as you know, are very quick; they're 5 minutes and 15-minute tests. And those are, frankly, the ones that I prefer.
But we're doing massive numbers, and the numbers are coming down. And as we go, as an example, there are thousands and thousands of kits being made right now which give you a 15-minute and a 5-minute test. So we'll be able to get those numbers down. Those numbers are similar in other places. They're also doing massive numbers, numbers like nobody thought possible. But those numbers will be coming down. I agree. I think it's a good thing if we can do that.
Q. Are you in favor of more money for testing? That if Republicans want——
The President. Well, they're going to make a presentation to me tonight and tomorrow on that. And again, we're leading the world. And I think the second country at 12 million. We're going to be over 50 million tests. Second country is India with 12 million. Then, you have 7 million, 6 million, and 4 million. I think that we are doing a tremendous amount of testing. But if the—if the doctors and the professionals feel that even though we're at a level that nobody ever dreamt possible, that they would like to do more, I'm okay with it.
White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Deborah L. Birx 
Q. Why aren't your doctors not with you here today? Where's Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx?
The President. Well, Dr. Birx is right outside.
Yes, please.
2020 Presidential Election/The President's Accomplishments 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I have got two questions for you, if that's all right. Number one, I just wanted to know, in November, do you want the American people to judge you——
The President. Could you speak up, please?
Q. Do you want the American people to judge you on the ballot in November by how you've handled this pandemic so far?
The President. This, among other things. I think the American people will judge us on this, but they'll judge us on the economy that I created and that already we're creating. We're setting record job numbers, as you know. I think we're going to have a very strong year next year. I think we're going to have a very strong third quarter, a very good fourth quarter. But I think next year is going to be a record year, and I think they're going to judge me on that.
I think they're going to judge me on the tax cutting and the regulation cutting, which nobody has ever done to the extent that we've been able to do it.
On rebuilding the military, on how we've handled the VA: On the VA, we got Veterans Choice. Nobody thought that would be possible. That's been many decades. They've been trying to get Veterans Choice. It's called ""Choice,"" where they can go get a doctor if they have to wait on line for 2 weeks or 5 weeks or 2 days. And frankly, that's been a great thing. And Veterans Accountability, I think they'll judge me on that. They'll judge me on all of the things we've done.
I don't think—and I think we can say this with surety, and it's never ever been even challenged. In 3½ years, the first 3½ years—the first years of a Presidency—I don't think any administration, any President has accomplished so much as we've accomplished, from energy to health to so many other things.
And then, this came in, and the plague—I call it the ""plague""—the plague came in, a terrible thing. Should have been stopped. Wasn't stopped. It came in. We had to shut things down to save potentially millions of lives. We did that, and now we've started them up. And I think we've really started it up very successfully.
Yes, please.
Q. Mr. President, Mr. President—— Federal Coronavirus Response 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You've been saying for months the virus would simply disappear, and now you're saying that it's likely to get worse before it gets better. If it does keep getting worse, if Americans keep dying, are you responsible for that?
The President. Well, the virus will disappear. It will disappear. I think that—I always like to say, as—you know, either way, when you look at it, the Governors are working with me. I'm working with the Governor. We're working hand in hand. I think we're all responsible. I view it as a team. Very good relationships with the Governors. Very, very good relationships.
I could say I'm fully responsible. But you know, one day, we had a virus come in, and I closed the borders, did a lot of things that were very good. In fact, Dr. Fauci said we saved tens of thousands of lives when I closed the border. And nobody wanted to do it. I wanted to do it. We closed the border to China. We put on the ban. We didn't want people coming in from heavily infected China.
Fairly shortly thereafter, I closed the borders from Europe—coming in from Europe. Those were tremendous moves. We would have—if it's one person, it's too much. But we're at, let's say, 140,000; we could have double, triple, quadruple that number if we didn't.
So we did a lot of things right. We did a lot of things right, including with equipment. So it's a shame that it happened. It shouldn't have happened. China should have stopped it.
Please.
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Yes, go ahead. Please.
Coronavirus Testing Access 
Q. Thank you, President Trump. If I could, two questions. My first question is: We have a very quick testing platform here at the White House.
The President. Yes.
Q. It's great. You get tested; you know very quickly. Do you think that it would be easier to reopen and restart businesses if we could produce more of those machines for people?
The President. We're trying to do that. That's a great question. We're trying very much to do that. So rather than sending your tests in—and you know, it goes through the mail 1 day, comes back another day, no matter how they send them. It's a day and a day, so that's 2 days already wasted. And then, if it spends—by the time you get it back, it's 3 or 4 days, if they do an efficient job. We're trying to get the testing on site.
Q. Thank you.
The President. I like it the best.
British Socialite Ghislaine N.M. Maxwell 
Q. And my follow-up—my second question; it's a little bit different topic, but it's one that a lot of people are talking about. Ghislaine Maxwell is in prison, and so a lot of people want to know if she's going to turn in powerful people. And I know you've talked in the past about Prince Andrew, and you've criticized Bill Clinton's behavior. I'm wondering, do you feel that she's going to turn in powerful men? How do you see that working out?
The President. I don't know. I haven't really been following it too much. I just wish her well, frankly. I've met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach, and I guess they lived in Palm Beach. But I wish her well, whatever it is. I don't know the situation with Prince Andrew. I just don't know. I'm not aware of it.
Yes, please. Go ahead.
Q. Mr. President——
Unemployment Insurance/Economic Stimulus Legislation 
Q. Mr. President, sir—thank you, sir. On unemployment insurance, how much below $600 are you willing to go? And you've said that the economy is bouncing back strong, so why do we need to even cut it at all?
The President. Well, the economy is getting stronger, and I think we have a chance to have a very strong economy, especially if some of the things that I just spoke about work.
We want to have people go back and want to go back to work as opposed to be, sort of, forced into a position where they're making more money than they expected to make. And the employers are having a hard time getting them back to work.
So that was a decision that was made. I was against that original decision, but they did that. It still worked out well because it gave people a lifeline, a real lifeline. Now we're doing it again. They're thinking about doing 70 percent of the amount. The amount would be the same, but doing it in a little bit smaller initial amounts so that people are going to want to go back to work, as opposed to making so much money that they really don't have to.
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. But we were very generous with them. I think that it's been a tremendously successful program. The whole thing has been successful, if you look. I mean, we have—we're in a pandemic, and yet we're producing tremendous number of jobs. That was something that nobody thought possible. Okay?
Please.
Protective Face Masks 
Q. Mr. President, thank you very much. Yesterday you said that wearing a mask was an act of patriotism. If that is the case, why don't you do it more frequently?
The President. Well, I do. I actually do it when I need. I mean, I carry the mask when I have to go—I went into Walter Reed Hospital the other day. I have the mask right here, and I carry it. And I will use it gladly. No problem with it. And I've said that.
And I say: If you can, use the mask. When you can, use the mask. If you're close to each other, if you're in a group, I would put it on. When I'm in a group—if I'm in an elevator and there are other people with me, including, like, security people, it's not their fault. They have to be in the elevator; I want to protect them also. I put on a mask.
I will have—I have no problem with the masks. I view it this way: Anything that potentially can help—and that certainly can potentially help—is a good thing. I have no problem. I carry it. I wear it. You saw me wearing it a number of times, and I'll continue.
Please.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you——
Q. A quick follow-up. Can I ask you a quick follow-up?
The President. Go ahead, please. Q. Are you sending mixed messages though? Yesterday you tweeted out an image wearing a mask. And then, last evening we saw you not wearing a mask at your hotel.
The President. Well, I don't know. The hotel—I was pretty far away from people, but I would say this: I've explained it, I think, very well. If you're close together, I would put on the mask, and if you're not—I would say that if you're—for instance, I'll see—like, here, you've been all tested; I've been tested. Oftentimes, I'll be with people that are fully tested; I've been tested. In theory, you don't need the mask. I'm getting used to the mask, and the reason is—think about patriotism. Maybe it is. It helps. It helps.
Now, we have experts that have said, in the recent past, that masks aren't necessarily good to wear. You know that. But now they've changed their mind. If they change their mind, that's good enough for me. So I wear it when appropriate.
Please.
Q. And, on testing, quick question——
Protective Face Masks/Social Distancing 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, sir. A lot of Americans, though, may be surprised at your change of tone over all of this, a more, perhaps, realistic tone. Some would look at it that way. The sudden embrace of masks, social distancing, the——
The President. Well, I've always agreed with that. I mean, I've never fought either one. But certainly, social distancing, I want to—it's—that's common sense.
Q. The idea that things——
The President. Six feet, to me, is common sense. I'd like to say maybe make it a little bit further.
Coronavirus Prevalence/Florida/Texas 
Q. The idea that things will get worse perhaps before they get better here, and perhaps the realization that this resurgence, if you will, is for real—when you used to talk about it in terms of little fires being put out here and there. Would you respond to that?
The President. We have them too. No, we have embers and fires, and we have big fires. And unfortunately, now Florida is in a little, tough—or in a big, tough position. You have a great Governor there. You have a great Governor in Texas. You have people that are very, very skilled people, and I think they're going to handle it very well.
Their hospital capacities are holding up, but Texas is a big State, and it's very well run, and so is Florida, and I think they'll do a very good job.
Q. Are you changing your tone though, sir?
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Yes, go ahead.
Coronavirus Vaccine and Treatment Development 
Q. I just wanted to ask you about the issue of vaccines, which you already mentioned. Yesterday a study by a Chinese company showed some promising results for its coronavirus vaccine candidate. If China were first in developing the vaccine, or even if it weren't, would the administration be willing to work with China to bring a successful Chinese vaccine to the U.S.? The President. Yes, we're willing to work with anybody that's going to get us a good result. We're very close to the vaccine. I think we're going to have some very good results. We're already in testing; nobody thought that would be possible. Under the old system, it would be a year to 2 years before you can even think about using the word ""testing.""
So I think we've had a lot of—and the reason we're testing: They've had good results. So now we have to see—and the testing also for safety, because they have to make sure it's safe. And I think you're going to see something over the next fairly short period of time, maybe very short period of time, having to do with therapeutics and vaccines that are very good.
So we'll be doing these quite often. We're going to keep you abreast of this, and we'll also talk about some of the other topics like our economy, which is doing well. The stock market had another good day. I think they have a good day, because they see a lot of positive things happening on this front too.
Thank you very much. Thank you."
"July 22, 2020",The President's News Conference,Donald J. Trump,"Donald J. Trump, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/343069",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1244,"The President. Thank you very much. Thank you. Today my administration reached a historic agreement with Pfizer to produce and deliver 100 million doses of their vaccine immediately following its approval. Hopefully, the approval process will go very quickly. And we think we have a winner there. We also think we have other companies right behind that are doing very well on the vaccines, long ahead of schedule.
As part of Operation Warp Speed, this agreement will also ensure that we receive an additional 500 million doses shortly thereafter. This is another crucial step in our effort to develop, manufacture, and distribute a vaccine in record-breaking time, really a very small fraction of the time, based on previous schedules. I want to thank the FDA. I want to thank everybody involved. It's been an incredible process.
As discussed yesterday, the China virus poses the greatest threat to our senior citizens, as we all know. The median age for those who die from the virus is 78 years old, and nearly half of the deaths have occurred among those living in nursing homes or long-term care facilities. That's really something.
In other words, approximately half of the fatalities have occurred among less than 1 percent of the U.S. population. So think of that: less than 1 percent, half of the fatalities. So we know what to look for.
From the beginning, we have made it our top priority to shelter our seniors. In early March, we announced guidelines suspending all medically unnecessary visits to nursing homes and prioritized resources for those facilities. And we gave it a very strong priority. FEMA has sent shipments to many different locations of protective equipment, and it's going directly to 15,400 Medicaid- and Medicare-certified nursing homes throughout the country.
Today I'd like to provide an update on the additional actions we've been able to take, and they've been very constructive. First, we're requiring increased testing of the nursing home personnel in States where you had the worst outbreaks. All personnel will be tested at the highest level. We're distributing 15,000 rapid, point-of-care diagnostic devices to support this effort. These are the tests where it takes 5 minutes to 15 minutes. They're very accurate. They're very good. And we're sending them all over the country. And over 600 devices will be also shipped this week to additional facilities.
Second, HHS will be distributing an additional $5 billion from the Provider Relief Fund to all nursing homes. Nursing homes in higher risk areas will be receiving more funding. This money can be used to address critical needs, including the hiring of additional staff, increasing testing, and providing technology support so residents can connect their families. And they can connect to their families. They are having a tremendous time. They want to be with their loved ones. They can't do it, so what we're doing is we're working it so that we can connect—have them connect with their families if they're not able to visit.
Third, we've been identifying especially high-risk nursing homes and sharing that information with the Governors so that the Governors and their staffs can take appropriate action. We're able to find—because of the testing programs and other means, we're able to find certain areas that are very high-risk. The Governors can then take action. Additionally, CMS, CDC, and the U.S. Public Health Service are providing enhanced technical assistance and support, including visits to the highest risk nursing homes. And that's their priority right now: nursing homes, but the highest risk nursing homes. CMS and CDC are implementing a national training program focused on infection control for those nursing homes that need it most. And we have them surveyed, and we have them mostly pinpointed.
Over the past few months, we've created a surveillance system to detect outbreaks. And currently, 99 percent of all nursing homes are reporting directly to it, so we have great data. When a nursing home has three or more cases, we alert the State and make sure that it responds very quickly. We check on it and make sure they respond very quickly.
I want to send a message of support and hope to every senior citizen who has been dealing with the struggle of isolation in what should be the golden years of your life. We will get to the other end of that tunnel very quickly, we hope. The light is starting to shine. We will get there very quickly. But we send our love; we send a message of love—very important. We're with you all the way.
As far as the outbreak in the Sun Belt, I said yesterday: We continue to vigorously combat the rise of cases in the South and Southwest and the West. We're closely monitoring and aggressively acting to control the infection in Texas, Arizona, California, Florida. Arizona is starting to come down. Done a very good job. They're all doing a good job. They're very talented people.
There are likely a number of causes for the spike in infections. Cases started to rise among young Americans shortly after demonstrations—which you know very well about—which presumably triggered a broader relaxation of mitigation efforts nationwide. And a substantial increase in travel also was a cause.
Increased gathering on holidays, such as Memorial Day, as well as young people closely congregating at bars and probably other places—maybe beaches—four or five different listed places; we have 12 that are listed on the guide—likely also contributed.
We're also sharing a 2,000-mile border with Mexico, as we know very well, and cases are surging in Mexico, unfortunately. I was with the President, and it's a big problem for Mexico. But cases are surging very sharply and all across the rest of the Western Hemisphere.
Two hundred and fifty-seven miles of newly constructed wall along the southern border has had a great, positive impact on people coming in. And we have record-low numbers of people coming in illegally; that's helped greatly. It was really meant for a different purpose, but it worked out very well for what we're doing right now and for the pandemic.
Nationwide, beyond the outbreak in several States, cases remain low and very stable. Nineteen States have positive test rates of less than 5 percent. Eight States have positive test rates of less than 2 percent. Our nationwide positive test rate is beginning to decline and is currently at 8.8 percent, compared to over 16 percent at its peak in April. It's coming down. It's coming down fairly rapidly.
Today we surpassed—first time—we surpassed 50 million tests. That's far more than any country in the world. India is second, we believe. We think—1.4 billion people; that's about 12 million tests. We have 50 million tests.
We're working with every State to ensure the supply of remdesivir for early case intervention and steroid treatment and various other treatments for those that are seriously ill. We're working very closely with hospitals, doctors, nursing homes—everybody. The remdesivir has proven to be terrific. Our case fatality rate continues to decline, and we want to push this rate even lower. The therapeutic research continues daily on new and very promising treatments, including antibody treatments and the use of blood thinners and steroids. A lot of different things are happening, and a lot of things are coming out that we wouldn't have known a number of months ago. We're doing tremendously well on therapeutic research and tremendously well on the vaccines.
And frankly, therapeutically—or maybe a word even beyond that word is ""cure""—would be the best of all, and we'll see what happens. But that would be great if we could go into the hospital and just cure people. And we're at a position where we're actually able to, to a certain extent, with what we have right now. And we think, in a very short period of time, we'll be able to do that.
Our strategy is to shelter the highest risk Americans, while allowing younger and healthier citizens to return to work or school while being careful and very vigilant. Wear a mask, socially distance, and repeatedly wash your hands. Practice very, very good sanitary means. You have to do this. You have to just—you have to look at it differently. Wash your hands often. I'm finding more and more people are saying, ""Wash your hands."" So wash your hands. We want young Americans to avoid packed bars and other crowded indoor gatherings.
And we're all in this together. And as Americans, we're going to get this complete. We're going to do it properly. We've been doing it properly. Sections of the country come up that we didn't anticipate—for instance, Florida, Texas, et cetera—but we're working with very talented people, very brilliant people, and it's all going to work out, and it is working out.
So, with that, I'll take a few questions, please.
Yes, please.
Crime in U.S. Cities/Federal Coronavirus Response 
Q. Mr. President, I just wanted to ask you a question about the surge of Federal agents to various cities.
The President. Yes.
Q. The mayor of Chicago just said, moments ago, that you're doing this to divert attention from your failures on coronavirus. You are only targeting cities——
The President. But we haven't had that failure. And——
Q. You are only targeting cities, though, run by Democrats. Is this just a political stunt?
The President. Yes, the cities, unfortunately, that are in trouble are all run by Democrats. You have radical-left Democrats running cities like Chicago and so many others that we just had a news conference. And unfortunately, that's the way it is. I mean, that's the facts.
When you look at Chicago and you look at the job—Mayor Lightfoot sent me a letter yesterday, and I think, in their own way, they want us to go in. There'll be a time when they're going to want us to go in full blast, but right now we're sending extra people to help. We're arresting a lot of people that have been very bad.
As far as the coronavirus, as you say, I think we've done some amazing things, and I think you'll probably see that if you compare our statistics to other countries. And if you look at death rates, et cetera, you're going to see—and especially into the future, with what's happening—you're going to see some very, very impressive numbers for the United States.
Jon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News], please.
Q. Just to follow up on that, sir, real quick? The President. Go ahead, Jon.
School Reopening Efforts/National Economy/Coronavirus Transmission Among Children 
Q. Mr. President, do you plan to do a national strategy to help schools reopen and reopen safely? And regarding the children in your family—your son, your grandchildren—are you comfortable—do you plan to have them back in person, in school this fall?
The President. Yes. Well, I am comfortable with that. And we do have a national strategy, but, as you know, ultimately, it's up to the Governors of the States. I think most Governors, many Governors want these schools to open. I would like to see the schools open, especially when you see statistics like this. We have great statistics on young people and on safety. So we would like to see schools open. We want to see the economy open.
We just had a report, literally as I walked in, that we set an alltime record on housing price increases, up, I think they said, 21 percent, which is a record. It's never happened before. That's a great sign. We have an economy that's going to be booming. It's going to be—a lot of jobs are being produced. The job numbers will be coming out shortly—meaning over the next week or so—and I think it will be a continuation of the last 2 months. The last 2 months have been incredible.
So I think we're going to have a great economy. You're going to have a fantastic next year. I think you're going to have a very good third quarter, actually, when the third quarter numbers come out. Interestingly, they'll be announced just before the election. They'll be announced around November 1.
So yes, I would like to see the schools open, open a hundred percent. And we'll do it safely; we'll do it carefully. But when you look at the statistics I just read, having to do with children and—and safety, they're very impressive. They have very strong immune systems.
Q. But you would understand that the——
The President. Please.
Q. ——the children who go to school then go back to home, they're with—some live with their grandparents.
The President. Sure.
Q. That there's a real risk. Would you understand if some schools——
The President. Well, they do say that they don't transmit very easily. And a lot of people are saying they don't transmit, and we're looking at that. We're studying, Jon, very hard that particular subject: that they don't bring it home with them.
Now, they don't catch it easily; they don't bring it home easily. And if they do catch it, they get better fast. We're looking at that fact. That is a factor, and we're looking at that very strongly. We'll be reporting about that over the next week.
Please.
Protective Face Masks 
Q. Mr. President, at least three Governors today came out with new orders on mask requirements.
The President. Yes.
Q. Is that something you wish all the Governors would do? Is that something you would encourage? The President. Well, a lot of the Governors, they have different requirements. Some of the Governors are very strong on masks; others aren't. I think it's really going to ultimately be up to them.
We've given them the facts. We've given them everything we know. They have their own facts. Some are strong on masks, and, as you know, some aren't in the same ballpark. But I think——
Q. Shouldn't they all be?
The President. Well, I think all are suggesting if you want to wear a mask, you wear it. I bring one. I have one. I've worn it. And I think when I'm in certain settings, like hospitals and various—or when I'm close—when, you know, when you can't socially distance, I believe in it. Let's see: Do I? I do. I have it.
And if—you know, in certain—in certain instances, I think you really—I think you want to travel with a mask. There are instances where you really can use it. I would believe it would be a good thing.
Yes, please.
Q. Sir, one, just, follow-up: DC Mayor Bowser came out with such an order today. It, of course, doesn't apply to Federal properties, but would you encourage Federal properties—and including the White House complex—to follow the order? Or on military bases?
The President. We're going to make a decision over the next 24 hours. We'll let you know what that decision is. Okay?
Q. Thank you.
The President. Thank you.
Please.
Economic Stimulus Legislation/National Economy 
Q. President Trump, do you agree with Senate Republicans discussing the possibility of extending short-term unemployment insurance today so that they prevent benefits from expiring?
The President. Well, I think a lot of politicians are discussing that: Republicans, Democrats. And right now a lot of my representatives are on the Hill. They're discussing CARES Act or phase four, whatever you want to call it. And I think, ultimately, something good will come out of it.
The economy is starting to really come back strongly, when you look at the numbers—even with the fact that—like California is still closed up and many big States. I think the numbers are even more impressive, considering that some States like California—big ones—are pretty well shut down.
So we expect to have something over a period of time—over the appropriate period of time.
Please, go ahead.
Deployment of Federal Law Enforcement Officers to U.S. Cities 
Q. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. These two questions are with Andrew Feinberg [Newsweek] and J.C. Bua [Talk Media News]. One is: Today you said you're sending Federal law enforcement officers to run cities run by ""extreme politicians""—that's the word you used—which—who happen to be all Democrats who have supported Black Lives Matter protests.
The President. I didn't say I that. I didn't say who supported—— Q. Millions of Americans voted for these people——
The President. No. I said Democrat politicians, and these are the cities where you have the problem. If you look at Chicago, if you look at Detroit, if you look—I mean, look around any of these cities where we have the problems. And we're sending them help, but we're really waiting for them to call for the big help, for the big numbers, for the large numbers of people that we have ready, willing, and able.
You look at Chicago, where 14 people were shot yesterday; where, over the weekend, many people died, and many people were shot; and, over the last month, they're setting record numbers. We are waiting for the mayor, respectfully, and other mayors and Governors to call us. We are ready, willing, and able to go in there with great force.
Now, we also have people that are going in and arresting drug dealers, arresting some of the shooters that are doing the shooting. We know who they are. We're working with police forces. And even though, in some cases, they're told, ""Don't work with the Federal Government,"" the police forces have great respect for the Federal Government, what we do.
But we're ready, willing, and able to go into these cities that are just being decimated with shooting. And we're going to help.
Please.
The President's Science and Health Advisers 
Q. I have a question on crime. But first, I don't think we really got an explanation yesterday on why the health experts are no longer joining you at these briefings. Can you explain why?
The President. Because they are briefing me. I'm meeting them. I just spoke to Dr. Fauci. Dr. Birx is right outside. And they giving me all of—everything they know, as of this point in time. And I'm giving the information to you, and I think it's probably a very concise way of doing it. It seems to be working out very well.
Q. Okay. So, on crime——
The President. But they're very much—they're very much involved. They're very much—the relationships are all very good. All very good. The relationships that we have with the doctors, with everybody working on the virus has been, I think, extraordinary.
Kayleigh is here, and I think you would say the same thing. You work with them all the time.
Yes, go ahead. Please.
Crime in Chicago, Illinois/Former President Barack Obama/Deployment of Federal Law Enforcement Officers to U.S. Cities 
Q. So, on crime: In 2016, you said it was President Obama's fault that homicides were up in Chicago. So why was it the President's fault then, but it's not your fault now?
The President. Chicago is a disaster. The mayor is saying, ""Don't come in."" The mayor is telling us not to come in. At some point, we can void that if we have to, but we—and we may have to, at some—because it's out of control. I assume she's saying that for political reasons. I think it's negative political reasons.
She's a Democrat. I'm going to be nice. She's a Democrat. She's making a big mistake. People are dying in Chicago and other cities, and we can solve the problem. They have to ask us, but—— Q. Right, but——
The President. ——we can solve the problem.
Q. ——why was it President Obama's fault in 2016? You credited it as him being in office.
The President. Because President Obama was invited in, and he did a poor job. President Obama could have gone into Chicago. He could have solved the problem, and he didn't. In our case, they don't want us in. We can solve the problem very easily. We're equipped with the best equipment, the best people.
And you see what we're doing. I mean, Portland was coming down; it was busting at the seams. And we went in and protected all the Federal buildings. Those Federal buildings are totally protected. But—and we had to do that. And Portland is a very different place than Chicago.
But Chicago should be calling us—and so should Philadelphia and Detroit and others—to go in and really help them. Because when you're losing many people a weekend—many, many people; you see the same numbers as I do—when you're losing these people, they should call us, and they should say, ""Come on in."" And it's incredible to me, but they're not doing it.
At some point, they will. At some point, we may have no other choice but to go in.

Trump Turnberry Resort in Turnberry, Scotland/China-U.S. Relations 
Q. Mr. President, are you looking at closing further Chinese Embassies in the United States?
And did you ask Ambassador Woody Johnson to bring the British Open to your Thurnberry—or Turnberry property in Scotland?
The President. No, I never spoke to Woody Johnson about that, about Turnberry. Turnberry is a highly respected course, as you know, one of the best in the world. And I read a story about it today. And I had never—I never spoke to Woody Johnson about doing that. No.
As far as closing additional Embassies, it's always possible. You see what's going on. We thought there was a fire in the one that we did close. And everybody said: ""There's a fire. There's a fire."" And I guess they were burning documents or burning papers, and I wonder what that's all about.
Okay, how about one or two more? Please.
Impact of the President's Policies on the African American Community 
Q. Yes, thank you. Would you like to respond to Joe Biden, who, today, described you—you might have heard that—as the first racist to be elected President. Those are his—that was his words.
The President. Well, you know, it's interesting because we did criminal justice reform. We passed criminal justice reform, something that Obama and Biden were unable to do. We did opportunity cities. We did the greatest—if you look at what we've done with Opportunity Zones, nobody has ever even thought of a plan like that.
Prior to the China plague coming in, floating in, coming into our country, and really doing terrible things all over the world—doing terrible things—we had the best African American, Hispanic American, Asian American—almost every group was the best for unemployment. The unemployment numbers were the best. You look at—so you look at employment; you look at Opportunity Zones; and maybe most importantly of all, you look at criminal justice reform; you look at prison reform. I've done things that nobody else—and I've said this, and I say it openly, and not a lot of people dispute it: I've done more for Black Americans than anybody, with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln. Nobody has even been close.
Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you."
"July 30, 2020",The President's News Conference,Donald J. Trump,"Donald J. Trump, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/343243",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1247,"The President. Thank you very much. Let me begin by expressing our sadness at the passing of a wonderful man and a dear friend of mine, Herman Cain. He was a very special person. I got to know him very well. And unfortunately, he passed away from the thing called the China virus. And we send our prayers to Herman's great wife Gloria. Wonderful family.
And I have to say, America grieves for all of the 150,000 Americans who had their lives taken by this horrible, invisible enemy. We mourn their loss, as a nation; we mourn their loss, as people, as people that love one another. And we're working very hard to not only contain this horrible event, this horrible plague—it's what it is, is a plague—but also to come up with therapeutics and vaccines. And we're making a lot of strides.
All over the world, they're having tremendous problems. A resurgence has taken place in many countries that people thought were doing well. Despite a wide range of approaches to the pandemic between countries, this resurgence in cases is occurring throughout large portions of our planet—in Japan, China, Australia, Belgium, Spain, France, Germany, Hong Kong—places where they thought it was—they had really done great. It came back. And in a couple of cases, it came back very strongly.
The virus was said to be under control, but new cases have risen very significantly once again. So when you think somebody is doing well, sometimes, you have to hold your decision on that; you have to hold your statement.
Since the beginning of June, daily new cases have increased by a factor of 14 times in Israel; 35 times—that's 35 times—in Japan; and nearly 30 times in Australia, just to name a few. These were countries that were doing incredibly well; leadership was being praised. Latin America now leads the world in confirmed infections. And with the scarcity of testing in Latin America, the true numbers—you have no idea what they might be. And I can say ""scarcity of testing."" Almost anywhere, except for our country.
This disease is highly contagious and presents unique challenges to our border States. Meanwhile, States like California, Washington State, Maryland, Virginia, Nevada, Illinois, Oregon, and many others, they were thought to be doing well, and they had a big resurgence and were hit very hard.
And Governors that were extremely popular are not so popular anymore. They were held up as models to follow, and then they got hit and—now, I'm not even saying this is their fault. It's probably not their fault. It's just the way it is. That's the way it is. Highly infectious, one of the most infectious diseases that anybody has ever seen. Not since 1917, over a hundred years ago, has anyone seen anything like what we're witnessing now.
But these states have also seen the virus substantially rebound. And, again, no one is immune. No one is immune. These facts illustrate the imposing determinant—and it is a determinant—that a blanket shutdown to achieve a temporary reduction in cases is certainly not a viable long-term strategy for any country. People are starting to understand the disease now. We certainly have understood a lot about the disease that we didn't have any idea. We didn't—nobody ever saw anything like this. The primary purpose of a shutdown was to flatten the curve, ensure sufficient hospital capacity, and develop effective treatments and therapies to reduce mortality. And we've done that. But it can come rearing back when you least suspect it.
We did the right thing initially. We saved millions of lives, what we did. We did the right thing. But a permanent shutdown would no longer be the answer at all. A small shutdown of certain areas—but we don't want to do that—small shutdowns can be very helpful, but not for long periods of time. We understand what we're dealing with now, but it's a very complex situation. And I can only say, thank Heaven that we are so advanced in what we're doing, in terms of vaccines and therapies.
We now know a great deal about the virus and how to treat it and who it targets. Almost half of the deaths come from less than 1 percent of our population. Think of it: Half of the deaths—really, a tremendous number—half of the deaths come from less than 1 percent of our population: those living in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. The average age of those who die from the illness is 78.
We've announced very strong measures to protect those who are most vulnerable. The scientific path forward is to protect those at highest risk, while allowing those at lower risk to carefully return to work and to school with appropriate precautions.
I'm once again urging the American people to protect their dear family and friends and anybody who's elderly, especially if somebody is elderly and they have heart problems, if they have certain illnesses. Diabetes is a very bad one, having to do with what we're discussing. But you want to protect the elderly and socially distance, wear a mask if you cannot socially distance, and practice vigorous hygiene.
Everyone, even healthy young people, should be taking extraordinary care to avoid infecting those at the highest risk from this terrible disease. The elderly and those with chronic health issues have to be protected.
In the current hotspots across the Sun Belt, the data is showing very encouraging signs. Arizona, in particular, has crossed an important threshold. For every person with the virus, we're now seeing an average of less than one additional person infected. And the numbers are coming down and coming down very substantially. They're starting to come down in Florida. Arizona is really leading away.
I was in Texas yesterday, and they're starting to come down significantly, we believe, in Texas. Need another few days to figure that one out, but it looks like they're coming down very significantly.
Earlier today I visited the Red Cross headquarters to discuss plasma therapy—which is a tremendous—a tremendous thing that they're looking at, and they have a lot of experience with it—potentially lifesaving treatments that infuse sick patients with powerful antibodies donated by those who have recovered successfully from this disease.
More than 2 million Americans have recovered from the virus, and today we're asking them to visit coronavirus.gov—coronavirus.gov—and volunteer to donate plasma. We need plasma. It's something that's been very effective, and we need plasma from those that were infected and successfully recovered, as most people do. Most people do.
Plasma is one of the many promising treatments my administration is accelerating. We've secured over 90 percent of the world's supply of remdesivir—which is terrific—an encouraging antiviral drug that can effectively block replication of the virus. We've also approved the use of the widely-available steroid—which has been very successful—dexamethasone, which has shown success, even in patients at more advanced stages of the disease. On July 17, we announced a $450 million agreement with Regeneron to build manufacturing plants and hundreds of thousands of doses of its antibody treatment, which is currently in late-stage clinical trials, moving along very rapidly. That's Regeneron.
As a result of such significant strides in treatment, the mortality rate in those over the age of 18 is 85-percent lower than it was just in April. So in a very short period of time. Think of that: Just 18—85-percent lower than it was in April. It's a big statement.
Now I want to provide an update on our efforts to ensure a strong economic comeback, including our negotiations on Capitol Hill. Throughout this crisis, my administration has taken the most aggressive action in history to rescue American workers. We love our American workers. And we've set records on job creation—records—2 months in a row.
We enacted a $3 trillion economic relief package. The Paycheck Protection Program alone saved over 50 million jobs. We delivered $300 billion to direct cash payments to Americans. We approved $500 billion for our hardest hit industries—$500 billion. We allowed struggling homeowners to reduce or defer their mortgage payments, and we put a nationwide moratorium on evictions from federally backed properties. It was a big thing, a very big thing. We also suspended student loan payments for 6 months, and we're looking to do that additionally and for additional periods of time.
As a result of these extraordinary steps by the administration, we added a record 7 million jobs in the 2 months past alone. To ensure this comeback continues, which we think it will—we had a great foundation to build on. We were the strongest country in the world; nobody close. We were outdoing everybody from China.
If you remember, for many years, you heard that in 2019, China would surpass the United States. Well, it didn't. We gained on them very significantly. We took it to a level that nobody has ever seen—2019, and we'll be back there very shortly. And it won't take very long, based on everything that we're seeing. It's not going to take very long. I think next year is going to be an excellent year, maybe one of our best years ever, from an economic standpoint.
We can never, ever forget the people that have been lost, and we never will. We'll never forget them; never forget what happened. This could have been stopped in China. They should have stopped it, and they didn't.
But I'm asking Congress to pass additional legislation to support Americans in need. First, we want a temporary extension of expanded unemployment benefits. This will provide a critical bridge for Americans who lost their jobs to the pandemic through no fault of their own. This was not anybody's fault. From the standpoint of jobs, it happened—a terrible thing happened. Could have been stopped. It happened.
I want to thank Senate Republicans for fighting to extend unemployment benefits today—in the face of very strong Democrat obstruction, which I'm surprised at—because this is great for our country, and it's great for our workers, and it wasn't our workers' fault.
Second, we're asking Democrats to work with us to find a solution that will temporarily stop evictions. We do not want people who have lost their jobs due to the virus to be evicted from their homes or apartments. We don't want that to happen.
Third, we need Democrats to join us to pass additional economic relief payments for American citizens, like the payments sent directly to 160 million Americans earlier this year, which was a tremendously successful program. This money will help millions of hard-working families get by.
My administration is also asking Democrats to work with us to pass $105 billion to help schools safely reopen. Children are not [Children are]* at the lowest risk. If you look at what's going on: the younger, the better. Amazing—the immune system. For children, the lower they are in age, the lower the risk, in terms of the age group itself.
I tell the story that, in New Jersey, with thousands and thousands of people dying—sadly, dying—the Governor was telling me that only one—Phil Murphy—only one died under the age of 18. That's incredible. Where thousands of people that died in the State of New Jersey, one made an impact; one died under the age of 18.
Children are at the lowest risk of any age group from the virus. Indefinite school closures will inflict lasting harm to our Nation's children. We must follow the science and get students safely back to school, while protecting children, teachers, staff, and family. We have to remember that there's another side to this: Keeping them out of school and keeping work closed is causing death also. Economic harm, but it's causing death for different reasons. But death—probably more death.
If Governors do not want to open the public schools, the money should go to parents so they can send their children to the school of their choice. So we say if a school doesn't want to open or if a Governor doesn't want to open—maybe for a political reason and maybe not, but there is some of that going on—the money should go to the parents so they can send their children to the school of their choice. If schools stay closed, the money should follow the students so families are in control of decisions about their sons and daughters, about their children.
But to pass a bill, Democrats must reject the extreme, partisan voices in their party. They have tremendous voices. They're looking at November 3. And probably a day later, they'll say, ""Let's open up the country."" But the Democrats have to reject the extreme, partisan voices in their party so that we can get our country going even quicker than it's going right now. We have a lot opening, and we have a lot of States that you thought were doing pretty poorly, from the standpoint of the virus, and they're actually coming back very strong.
This pandemic has underscored the importance of economic policies that put American families and workers first. I got elected on the fact that I put America first. For many, many decades, in my opinion, we put America last. If you look at the crazy, horrible, disgraceful trade deals that we've watched for many years destroy our country—NAFTA, we terminated it. We have USMCA now, which is a great deal, and our farmers are doing really well despite the pandemic. But we put America first, America's families first, and America's workers first.
But that means bringing jobs and factories back to our shores, reducing unnecessary regulations, and creating new training opportunities for jobs and for the future. We've cut regulations at a level that no President has ever cut regulations. And we've cut taxes more than any President in the history of our country.
Americans always rise to the challenge, and we will emerge more resilient, more self-reliant, more independent, and more prosperous than ever before.
So I just want to thank you all. And if you'd like, we'll take a few questions.
Steve [Steve A. Holland, Reuters], please.
2020 Presidential Election/Absentee Voting Policies/Potential Voter Fraud Risks 
Q. Are you going to launch an effort to try to delay the election? Or was that just a trial balloon this morning? The President. Well, what I want to explain to people, but it doesn't need much explanation—I mean, you look at article after article: ""New York's Mail-Vote Disaster,"" ""Tens of thousands of mail ballots have been tossed out in this year's primaries. What will happen in November?"" It's a mess. This is done by Washington Post. Can you believe it? The Washington Post, of all papers. Fake news, but in this case, it's not fake, it's true.
This is done by the Wall Street Journal. Here's another one, ""Vote-by-mail experiment reveals potential problems within postal voting system ahead in the November election."" And you see what's happening with so many different places. They're doing even trial runs; they're a disaster.
And I don't want to see an election—you know, so many years, I've been watching elections. And they say the ""projected winner"" or the ""winner of the election""—I don't want to see that take place in a week after November 3 or a month or, frankly, with litigation and everything else that can happen, years. Years. Or you never even know who won the election.
You're sending out hundreds of millions of universal, mail-in ballots—hundreds of millions. Where are they going? Who are they being sent to? It's common sense; you don't have to know anything about politics. And the Democrats know this. The Democrats know this, Steve.
So I want to see—I want an election and a result much, much more than you. I think we're doing very well. We have the same fake polls, but we have real polls. We're doing very well.
I just left Texas. And Biden came out against fracking. Well, that means Texas is going to be one of the most unemployed States in our country. That means Oklahoma, North Dakota, New Mexico are going to be a disaster. Ohio, Pennsylvania—disaster. No fracking.
I want to have the result of the election. I don't want to be waiting around for weeks and months. And literally, potentially—if you really did it right—years, because you'll never know.
These ballots are missing. You saw Paterson, New Jersey. You saw many other instances. There's tremendous litigation on that right now.
And that doesn't include absentee. Absentee is different. Absentee, you have to work and you have to send in for applications. You have to go through a whole procedure. Like, for instance, I'm an absentee voter because I can't be in Florida because I'm in Washington; I'm at the White House. So I'll be an absentee voter. We have a lot of absentee voters, and it works. So we're in favor of absentee, but it's much different than millions of people.
In California, they're going to send out tens of millions of voting forms. Well, where are they going to go? You read where postmen are in big trouble now. You read where city councils are in big trouble now. Voter fraud, all over the ballots.
So no, I want to get—I want to be standing, hopefully, hand held high, big victory, because we're doing things with our country that I think nobody else could have done. Our country is—despite this pandemic, which is devastating the rest of the world, by the way—devastating.
One of the articles that came out was, ""The World's COVID Resurgence."" This is the Wall Street Journal editorial, the main editorial yesterday in the Wall Street Journal. I don't always agree with them. But they have ""The World's COVID Resurgence."" ""Countries hailed as models to see""—and then they go, the virus returns at a level it's never—they haven't even seen.
We've been giving praise to certain countries, and the virus has now come to them like the first time. But it's a very interesting—and it talks about many countries where everybody was holding them up and saying what a great job they did. Well, it's just one of those things. Didn't work out so well. So we want to have an election. I'd love to see voter ID, but this is the opposite of voter ID. The Democrats love it; the Republicans hate it. We all agree that absentee voting is good. Mail-in ballots will lead to the greatest fraud.
You know, we talk about ""Russia, Russia, Russia"" for 2½ years, and then they found nothing, and there was nothing. But they talk ""Russia, Russia, Russia."" They talk China. They talk all of these countries. They say they get involved in our elections. This is easy. You can forge ballots. This is much easier for foreign countries.
Go ahead, Steve.
Q. But delaying the election is probably a nonstarter. I mean, wouldn't you agree with that?
The President. I just feel—I don't want a delay. I want to have the election. But I also don't want to have to wait for 3 months and then find out that the ballots are all missing and the election doesn't mean anything. That's what's going to happen, Steve. That's common sense, and everyone knows it. Smart people know it. Stupid people may not know it. And some people don't want to talk about it, but they know it.
And no, we want to have an election where people actually go in and—""What's your name?"" ""My name is so-and-so."" Boom, you sign the book, like I've been doing for years.
It's very, very unfair to our country. If they do this, our country will be a laughingstock all over the world, because everyone knows it doesn't work.
How many ballots is he sending in California, as an example? Twenty-eight million or some massive number? Other States are sending out millions and millions of ballots. Well, they've done it. They had experiments. They had news organizations experimenting.
And look, read the story in the Washington Post about mail-in voting; it's a disaster. I'm very surprised to see that story, frankly, from them. The story is a disaster. So we're asking for a lot of trouble.
And no, do I want to see a date change? No. But I don't want to see a crooked election. This election will be the most rigged election in history if that happens.
John [John Roberts, Fox News].
2020 Presidential Election/Absentee Voting Policies 
Q. So, Mr. President, you said that you don't want to see a delay in the election, but then it looks like the process of these mail-in ballots is going to continue to November the 3rd.
The President. Well, we have many court cases, John. We have one that's been filed for a while now in Western Pennsylvania, as an example, on mail-in ballots.
Q. So I'm just wondering, is——
The President. And by the way, John, we give tremendous examples, numbers of examples of all the fraud and all of the things that have taken place with respect to mail-in ballots.
Q. I'm just wondering, is the net effect of what you tweeted this morning and what you're talking about now to cast doubt on the results of the November 3 election?
The President. Well, it's had an interesting impact. I didn't know it was going to be the impact it had. What people are now looking at is: Am I right? But not me. Are all these stories right about the fact that these elections will be fraudulent, they'll be fixed, they'll be rigged? And everyone is looking at it, and a lot of people are saying, ""You know, that probably will happen.""
Please, Jennifer [Jennifer Jacobs, Bloomberg News]. Coronavirus Relief Legislation 
Q. Mr. President, to break the logjam in Congress and to prevent that unemployment insurance from lapsing, what do you plan to put on the table tonight? What are you planning——
The President. Well, it's a great question. I can't tell you, though, because that wouldn't be very smart from a negotiating standpoint. But we'll be putting certain things on the table.
Q. Do you have a plan to put something on the table?
The President. We want to get money to people. It wasn't their fault. And we want to get money to people, and it has to be substantial. It's not their fault what happened.
The fact is, people don't like saying it—they know it's true—it's China's fault. Okay? It's not their fault. It's not the worker who lost his job; it's China's fault. And that's the way it is.
OAN, please.
Protests and Civil Unrest in Portland, Oregon/Deployment of Federal Law Enforcement Officers 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Yesterday DHS came to an agreement with the Governor of Oregon to remove Federal officers, and Oregon State troopers took over. Mayor Ted Wheeler was noticeably absent from that agreement. Are you confident, sir, that the State of Oregon will be able to quell the protests in Portland? And if the violence does continue, would you consider redeploying Federal troops?
The President. So our people have done—Homeland Security have done a fantastic job. They went to Oregon a little more than a week ago. The place was a mess. The city, Portland, was just a disaster. You see it, and a lot of people weren't reporting it right. They tried to pretend it was a protest, as opposed to anarchists and agitators. You understand what I'm saying. It's a mess.
They went there a short while ago, and they saved a Federal courthouse that costs hundreds of millions of dollars. And they put a ring around the courthouse, and they saved it. But the group that's there is basically meant to save buildings, and they were very strong, very powerful. And they didn't come out too often out of this cocoon that they built in order to save these very expensive, valuable, and psychologically important buildings—right?—like courthouses.
The Governor and the mayor, we've been dealing with them, and we think they don't know what they're doing, because this should not have been going on for 60 days. It's not our job unless, in case of emergency—which I consider now to be an emergency—it's not our job to go in and clean out the cities. That's supposed to be done by local law enforcement.
Yesterday the Governor worked a deal where they'll do it; we'll stand by, they'll do it—and that's good. That was very good, but she didn't report it that way. What she reported was totally different. She said, ""I think Trump wants to take over the country."" It's crazy.
So what happened is, our people are staying there to see whether or not they can do it today and tomorrow. And if they don't do it, we will send in the National Guard and we'll take care of it. And we're telling, right now, these protesters—and many should be arrested, because these are professional agitators, these are professional anarchists; these are people that hate our country. We're telling them, right now, that we're coming in very soon, the National Guard. A lot of people. A lot of very tough people. And these are not people that just have to guard the courthouse and save it. These are people that are allowed to go forward and do what they have to do. And I think that makes the Governor's job and the mayor's job a lot easier. So they're working today and probably tomorrow to clean out this beehive of terrorists. And if they do it, I'm going to be very happy. And then, slowly, we can start to leave the city. If they don't do it, we'll be sending in the National Guard.
Please.
School Reopening Efforts 
Q. Mr. Trump, given what's happening with Major League Baseball and now, today, the Rutgers football team is quarantined, how can you assure people that schools will be safely reopened?
The President. So can you assure anybody of anything? I do say, again: Young people are almost immune to this disease. The younger, the better, I guess. They're stronger. They're stronger. They have a stronger immune system. It's an incredible thing. Nobody has ever seen this before. Various types of flu will hurt young people more than older people.
But young people are almost immune. If you look at the percentage, it's a tiny percent of 1 percent. It's a tiny percent of 1 percent. So we have to have our schools open. We have to protect our teachers. We have to protect our elderly. But we do have to have our schools open.
Q. Mr. President——
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Yes, please. Go ahead.
Coronavirus Vaccine and Treatment Development 
Q. Mr. President, a week ago, you said: ""We are in the process of developing a strategy that's going to be very powerful,"" involving the coronavirus. Where is that strategy?
The President. Oh, I think you're seeing it, and I think you will see it. And one of the things that we've done that we're getting—and it hasn't been utilized fully yet—but we're all set to march when it comes to the vaccine.
We have great therapeutics that are testing very well, and we have great vaccines from incredible companies—Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer and Merck——
Q. But—[inaudible]—actually slowing the spread of the virus?
The President. ——and all of these great companies, and they're doing very well.
And the delivery system is all set, logistically. We have a general that—that's all he does, is deliver things, whether it's soldiers or other items. And I think you're going to see something that's going to be spectacular.
The FDA has approved things at a rate that's a tiny fraction of what it would cost—what it would take during a—another administration, let's say.
We are way ahead on vaccines, way ahead on therapeutics. And when we have it, we're all set up with our platforms to deliver them very, very quickly. The vaccines are doing well, the therapeutics are doing well, and we're all set to deliver them as soon as we have them, and that's going to be very soon.
Thank you very much. Thank you."
"August 04, 2020",The President's News Conference,Donald J. Trump,"Donald J. Trump, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/343257",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1249,"The President. Hello, everybody. Thank you very much. Let me begin by sending America's deepest sympathies to the people of Lebanon, where reports indicate that many, many people were killed, hundreds more were very badly wounded in a large explosion in Beirut. Our prayers go out to all the victims and their families. The United States stands ready to assist Lebanon. We have a very good relationship with the people of Lebanon, and we will be there to help. It looks like a terrible attack.
I also want to provide the latest on Tropical Storm Isaias. Approximately 600,000 are without power along the East Coast, and utility companies are working around the clock to restore service as quickly as possible. I spoke to Governor Cooper, I spoke to Governor DeSantis, and I spoke to all of the people at FEMA, and they're working very hard.
Coastal areas in the storm's path can expect to see the storm surge and rip currents, while inland areas could see flooding and very, very high winds. FEMA is responding to States that have requested the assistance. We have a list of those States; we can give them to you in a little while. And my administration is monitoring the situation very closely.
We have the military on guard, but we have—FEMA is there, in all cases. The Corps of Engineer is ready if needed—the Army Corps of Engineers. Very talented people. I urge everyone in the storm's path to remain alert and to follow the guidance of your State and local authorities.
I now want to update you on the path forward, having to do with the China virus. Before I do that, I want to give you some numbers, which are rather spectacular, that just came out. The manufacturing index of the Institute for Supply Management—that's ""ISM""; most of you know it by ""ISM""—increased for the third month in a row, rising nearly 2 points in July to 54.2—that's fantastic—the highest reading since March of 2019.
This is remarkable, considering the survey was conducted throughout July and showed significant improvement despite the Southwest, in particular, virus hotspots. The ISM measures—and it's a very strong measure of new orders. It rose 5 points in July, to 61.5, in its highest rating, that would be, since September of 2018. That's a big number.
Since the April low, new orders are up over 34 points, which is the largest increase in the history of the ISM, dating back all the way to 1948. So 34 points—that's the largest since 1948. Similarly, the ISM's measure of production is up 35 points from its April low to a reading of 62.1, which is the largest 3-month gain in over 70 years. That's some number. These were somewhat surprising, but I've been saying we're doing well, and those numbers are really spectacular.
Automobile sales, likewise, are a key factor in the resurgence of manufacturing since the March low of 8.8 million units with sales and all of the numbers that are going up, stunningly. Its 65-percent increase since then, to 14.5 million units, which is a massive number.
The great strength and great news is really for States like—in particular, Michigan; and Ohio; South Carolina; Pennsylvania, very good; Florida, a little bit. These are great numbers, record-setting numbers.
The strength in new car sales is also evident in the used car market, where soaring demand—literally, soaring demand—is putting upward pressure on the used car prices. This is a leading indicator of the motor vehicle industry. The need to restock depleted shelves will further galvanize the factory sector—and, we think, very substantially, based on the numbers. We're very, very happy with these numbers. And I think most people are anywhere from surprised to shocked by these numbers, in a very positive way.
Economy-wide, inventories crashed at a near $320 billion annualized rate last quarter. A crash, in that case, means a good thing, not a bad thing. That's the largest drop ever on record—ever.
Homebuilder sentiment, likewise, is soaring, as our home sales sentiment is now higher than last year. And new homes recently made a 13-year high. So we have a 13-year high in new home construction.
New business applications are very strong. That just came out. The widely followed Atlanta Fed GDP—and it's something that they have just come out with—now forecasts the new data point and incorporates it into quarterly estimates. It looks like it's showing a 20-percent annualized growth in the current quarter. So 20 percent in the current quarter; we'll take that all day long. I—let's see if that's right. That's a projection. So we'll see if that's right. The Atlanta Fed, very respected.
The virus—back to that—we are continuing to monitor and monitor, in particular, hotspots across the South, Southwest, and the West. And we're seeing indications that our strong mitigation efforts are working very well, actually, especially to protect those who are most at risk, which has really been our primary focus for—ever since we've gotten to understand this horrible, horrible plague that's been unleashed on our country by China.
As of yesterday, cases are declining in 70 percent of the jurisdictions, compared to 36 percent last Monday. That's a big, big number. Eleven out of 13 States with the positive rate above 10 percent have seen a decline in daily cases since mid-July. In other States, the data suggests that the need for continuing vigilance always is strong, even though the numbers are getting very good—States that have a test positivity rate between 5 and 10 percent. And in the States with the lowest positivity rates, we also see slight increases in daily cases in a couple of them.
We must ensure that these States do not become new flareups, so we're watching them very, very closely. Fortunately, thanks to substantial improvements in treatment and the knowledge we have gained about the disease itself, the recent rise in cases has not been accompanied by a significant increase in deaths.
Fatalities nationwide are at roughly half the level of the April peak. So the death—the number of deaths or fatalities are at half the level. One is too much—one death—because this should have never happened to us. It should have been stopped at—very easily, by China, in Wuhan.
Thanks to our major advances in treatment, we've seen vast improvements in recovery rates across all age groups. Compared to April, mortality rates are 85-percent lower among individuals aged 18 to 69, and 70-percent lower among individuals over 70 years old.
We've also made significant strides in sheltering those at highest risk, especially the elderly. Approximately 85 percent of all current cases are individuals under the age of 65—just getting some very accurate numbers on this. And these are people who are generally at a much lower risk of complications.
Since the pandemic began, nearly half of all fatalities have been at nursing homes or assisted living centers. That's an incredible statistic, when you hear that number. This data underscores that the best path forward is an aggressive strategy focused on protecting Americans at highest risk.
As we race toward the development of a vaccine, we must continue to take extraordinary precautions to shield the elderly, and we're doing that. We're doing that at a level that we've never even dreamt possible, both with testing and with common sense. And those with underlining [underlying]* conditions, especially the elderly with the underlining—whether it's heart or diabetes—they seem to be the two most predominant conditions that cause tremendous problems. While allowing those at lowest risk to carefully return to work and to school.
Where embers flare up, we must engage immediately, and that's what we're doing. This is the science-based approach, and that's good with us. Working very hard on that. An extended lockdown would fail to target resources at the highest risk populations, while inflicting massive economic pain, long-lasting damage on society and public health as a whole.
So there won't be lockdowns, but we watch specific areas. We're very careful, and we're putting out embers. We're putting out flames. When you look at what's happening with Miami, and it's going—the numbers are going down. But Florida is going down very significantly. Texas and California are going down rather significantly.
On telemedicine, as we discussed the last time, as—and as I said numerous times during this day, it's an incredible thing that's happening. A central part of our effort to protect the elderly is to greatly expand access to telehealth, so seniors can be treated from the safety of their homes. And that's what's happening. The number of Medicare beneficiaries using telehealth increased from roughly 14,000 a week to nearly 1.7 million—so from 14,000 to 1.7 million per week. In total, 10 million Medicare beneficiaries have accessed telehealth services since the pandemic began. That's a tremendous thing that's happened with telehealth.
As we shelter those at high risk, we are also pouring every resource at our disposal into the development of therapies and vaccines. Two vaccine candidates are currently in the final stage of clinical trials, with several more vaccine candidates entering phase three in the coming weeks. And you've read and seen what's happened today. Today's news was very exciting.
Through Operation Warp Speed, we're also mass producing all of the most promising vaccine candidates, and we're determined to have a vaccine very quickly. We think we're going to have something very soon.
We have great companies. These are the—among the greatest companies in the world. But right now they don't like me so much because I'm forcing them to drop drug prices—prescription drug prices—very massively. Some of these companies are involved in that; some of them aren't. We're having a tremendous—you'll see a tremendous drop in price. We're using favored nations; we're using the rebates. We're using everything.
For so long, I've heard about how wealthy the middlemen are. They call them ""the middlemen."" And they are very wealthy. Nobody even knows who they are, but they're very wealthy people.
And we're doing the rebates. We're doing purchases from other countries, like Canada, which buys drugs for much less money than the United States is allowed to, under a very bad system. I don't call it ""archaic""; I call it ""bad"" because it's meant, really, for drug companies to get higher prices.
But under the system of matching that we have, if Germany has a pill for 10 cents and ours is $2, we're allowed to say we want favored nations, and we want the pill for the same—the same as the lowest country in the world. If they sell to one country lower than anybody else, that's the price we're going to get. Drug companies aren't too happy about that, Big Pharma. We've also dramatically accelerated the availability of plasma therapies, steroid treatments, antivirals, and other therapies to treat the illness. Today the NIH—we're—very exciting—announced that they're beginning the trial of two new antibody treatments, which will take place in 40 cities across the country. We're going to move very quickly. Results look very good already. Incredible results.
More than 230 clinical trials for potential treatments are underway, and we've secured 500,000 courses of treatment for remdesivir—of remdesivir. We're really doing a job with it, and it's helping a lot of people. That's why you see the fatalities and mortality numbers looking very good, relatively speaking, that is. But that's for American hospitals through the month of September. So we have remdesivir at a very high level for hospitals through the month of September. That's big news.
The United States also has far and away the most robust testing capacity in the world. Testing has been incredible, what we've been able to do. Nobody is even close. Since March 12, we've increased daily testing by 32,000 percent. How's that? Thirty-two thousand percent. Somebody would say, ""That must be a typo."" It's not a typo. Thirty-two thousand percent.
We now have conducted over 61 million tests nationwide, averaging over 820,000 tests per day and nearly 5 million tests per week. And now that we're understanding the virus, we're understanding very much what we're doing with respect to who it affects, who it's destroying, and who gets away with it, like young people, very young people. We'll be having some interesting statements having to do a testing and focus testing. I call it ""focus testing.""
By comparison, Mexico—so we're doing numbers that are incredible. But by comparison, Mexico—as you know, the President was here; he's a great guy—but their numbers are much different. They do about 1 million tests. France has done 2.9 million tests. Canada is around the 4 million mark. Australia is around the 4 million mark. The United States is testing more people in a single week than, in many cases, large segments or large, well-known countries all put together. It's been an amazing achievement: the testing and the quality of the testing also. And now we're doing testing where you can have results in 5 minutes, in 7 minutes, and 15 minutes, as opposed to waiting to come back from labs—for it to come back from labs.
Over the last several weeks, HHS has opened surging testing sites in Baton Rouge; New Orleans; Phoenix; Miami; Jacksonville, Florida; McAllen, Texas; Bakersfield, California. And this week, we're opening new surge sites in Houston, Texas; Atlanta. To date, more than 130,000 tests have been conducted at these sites.
Last week, the FDA also authorized the first two tests that display an estimated quantity of antibodies present in the individual's blood, which is a big deal, allowing us to learn more about the immune response.
FEMA and HHS has worked with the private sector to deliver more than—we have new numbers—more than 200 million N95 masks, 855 million surgical masks, 36 million goggles and face shields, 364 million gowns and coveralls, and 21 billion gloves—billion. Can you believe that? Billion gloves.
And we distribute that to the Governors, different States. And they're—when we get on the phone with them, they're very happy, that I can tell you. No complaints from any of them. They're very, very happy. What they say to you separately maybe will change for political reasons, but they are very happy with the job we've done.
In our National Stockpile, we've tripled the number of N95 masks on hand to more than 40 million; tripled the number of gowns to 15 million; and quadrupled the number of ventilators to nearly 70,000. These numbers are growing every day, and we're now making thousands of ventilators—many thousands of ventilators—a month. And we're getting them to other countries who are desperately in need of ventilators. They're very hard to produce. They're very complicated machines. So we're fully stocked here, and we've made sure that every State is fully stocked, but we're getting them to a lot of countries that need help.
We'll continue to work with the Governors and local authorities to help them ensure significant hospital capacity, protective equipment, supplies, and medicine. I'm more confident than ever that we will get a vaccine very soon and we will defeat the virus.
And I want to thank you all for being here. We'll take a few questions.
Yes, please.
Eastman Kodak Company 
Q. Mr. President, I wanted to ask you about Kodak. You had a big announcement the other day about getting Kodak into the pharmaceutical business, but the SEC is now investigating what happened. Can you say a word or two whether you think that there might have been some kind of a problem in terms of how those arrangements were made? Is there any grounds for concern, from your perspective?
The President. Well, I don't know. I wasn't involved in the deal. The concept of the deal is good, but I'll let you know. We'll do a little study on that, and we'll find out.
Q. Okay. And——
The President. If there's—if there is any problem, we'll let you know about it very quickly, but I wasn't involved in it.
It's a big deal. It's a way of bringing back a great area too, in addition to the pharmaceuticals. Kodak has been a great name, but obviously pretty much in a different business. And so we'll see what that's all about, but we'll let you know very quickly.
Yes, please.
Explosion in Beirut, Lebanon 
Q. I just wanted to follow up, before I ask a coronavirus question, on Lebanon. You called this an ""attack."" Are you confident that this was an attack and not an accident?
The President. Well, it would seem like it, based on the explosion. I've met with some of our great generals, and they just seem to feel that it was. This was not a—some kind of a manufacturing explosion type of event. This was a—seems to be, according to them—they would know better than I would, but they seem to think it was a attack. It was a bomb of some kind, yes.
Coronavirus Mortality Rates 
Q. Interesting. And, on coronavirus, you've talked a lot about—when you talk about the mortality rate, the deaths as a proportion of cases, which—I understand that is significant when you look at how deadly the virus is or how good a country does at keeping people alive———
The President. Right.
Q. ——who get infected. But when you're talking about the scope of this virus, when you look at the percentage of the population that's died, there's only three countries that have more deaths than the U.S. So how do you explain that: that—why the percentage of the population who has died is so much higher in the U.S.? The President. Well, I think, actually, the numbers are lower than others. I'll get back to you on that. But we, proportionately, are lower than almost all countries. We're at the bottom of the list.
And we're—relative to cases, also, we're at the bottom of the list, which is a good thing, being at the bottom of the list. But I can get back to you. We have about four or five different lists on that. And we're, generally speaking, at the very bottom of the list. So I'll get back to you.
Q. Because when I—when I look at the Johns Hopkins, you know, Coronavirus Resource Center on their website, it says the most affected countries, when you look at deaths per 100,000 people of the population—so how many people in the population have died—you have the U.K., Peru, Chile, and then the U.S.
You know, Canada has 8,000, 9,000 deaths. Obviously, they're smaller than us, but that's only 6 percent of the population—you know, that's 6 percent of our total cases. So why are the deaths so much higher in the U.S.?
The President. Well, a lot of our numbers were based on the—New York had a very tough time, as you know. New York, New Jersey—that area. And when you take them out—just as an example, take a look at Florida, relative to New York.
That's not to say anything wrong with New York. It was just a very tough place. People are close together. It's crowded. It's not easy.
But when you take that out, our numbers are among the lowest. And even with it in—I will get back to you, but we have among the lowest numbers. They've done a fantastic job on it.
Yes, please. Go ahead.
Economic Stimulus Legislation/Deployment of Federal Law Enforcement Personnel to Portland, Oregon/The President's Executive Authority/Moratorium on Evictions 
Q. Yes, Mr. President. I would like to ask a question about the election, but one thing on unemployment first. Are you considering taking executive action to extend or, rather, reinstate the unemployment benefits that expired last week, if Congress can't get a deal by the end of the week?
The President. Yes.
Q. And, as a general point, what rate, then, would you want in there: a percentage or a flat rate?
The President. We are looking at it. We're also looking at various other things that I'm allowed to do under the system, and—such as the payroll tax suspension. And so we're allowed to do things.
We're talking with the Democrats. They seem to be much more interested in solving the problems of some of the Democrat-run States and cities that have suffered greatly through bad management. I mean, really bad management. So that seems to be where they're looking for a trillion dollars to help out with cities that are run by Democrats, in some cases, radical-left Democrats that have not done a good job.
I appreciate—today the Wall Street Journal said very good things—that we did a great job in Portland by having our people go in. Homeland Security, Chad Wolf, and the folks—we went into Portland, and we've done a great job. And they had that in an editorial, that we really won that situation. But we want the whole—we did save the courthouse. The courthouse was going to be burned down or knocked down. It was in tremendous danger. We went in. We took care of it. And we appreciated what the Wall Street Journal said.
As far as the various things that I may or may not sign: I may not have to sign. I mean, progress is being made, as you know very well, on the Hill. We'll see what happens. But I have the right—including the payroll tax suspension. We may do some things.
We want to take care of the eviction problem. People are being evicted very unfairly. It's not their fault. It's China's fault; it's not their fault. And people are being evicted, and we can do that with an Executive order. So if we don't get—and we want to do it relatively quickly.
I mean, even from the standpoint of COVID, people get evicted, and then they go into shelters, and there are thousands of people in the shelters. And this is not a time—you never want to be in a shelter, but this is not a time to be in a shelter with the COVID. They catch it, they get it, and it's no good.
So I may have to do something on evictions too, because the Democrats, amazingly, don't want to do it. We offered them short-term deals, and we offered them lots of alternatives. But so far, the only thing they really want to do is bail out States that have been poorly managed by Democrats.
Okay. Please, go ahead.
Q. And if I could, on the election, sir—can I——
TikTok/Microsoft Corporation 
Q. President Trump, on the sale of TikTok, you're basically arguing that the U.S. Government is going to collect a cut from a—of a transaction including two companies, in which it doesn't hold a stake in.
That's unprecedented. That's never happened in U.S. history before, and the administration has offered very little explanation about how that's going to work. Can you back your statement up and provide specifics about how that would work?
The President. Did you say, ""That's impressive""? Did you actually use that term?
Q. I said it's ""unprecedented.""
The President. Oh, unprecedented—well, it's almost the same thing. Not quite. [Laughter] I like ""impressive."" I like ""impressive"" much better. Not quite, but close.
So TikTok—TikTok is very successful. It does tremendous business in the United States. People are riveted by it. I mean, I have many friends—when they saw that announcement, they're calling. And I think their kids love it; they don't. Because they don't get to see their kids anymore, but they are—it's an amazing thing, whatever it may be.
And I told Microsoft—and frankly, others—if they want to do it, if they make a deal for TikTok—whether it's the 30 percent in the United States or the whole company, I say: ""It's okay. But if you do that, we're really making it possible, because we're letting you operate here.""
So the United States Treasury would have to benefit also, not just the sellers. And I said, ""Inform""——
Q. [Inaudible]—through a tax, or how?
The President. Very simple. I mean we have—we have all the cards because, without us, you can't come into the United States. It's like if you're a landlord, and you have a tenant. The tenant's business needs a rent; it needs a lease. And so what I said to them is, ""Whatever the price is, a very big proportion of that price would have to go to the Treasury of the United States.""
And they understood that. And actually, they agreed with me. I mean, I think they agreed with me very much.
Yes, please. In the back.
Q. Thank you, sir.
The President. So that deal may or may not happen. We've given them until September 15 or so, and we'll see.
If we can have it and there can be great security—meaning, the obvious security—Microsoft would be a company that would be good in that respect. They're approved in that respect at many levels, including working with the Department of Defense. And you know, they're very high-level approvals. So it would be good, but there are other companies also.
Yes, please.
TikTok/Security Risks of Foreign Technology Companies/Coronavirus Outbreak in China 
Q. Thank you, sir. Have you or the—anyone in the administration reached out to other companies, aside from Microsoft, to see if they're interested in maybe buying——
The President. No, we've had other companies call us, and Microsoft called me directly. And we've had other companies call. I don't know where they are. It sounds like Microsoft is along the way of doing something. I don't blame them. It'd be—you know, it's great company. It's really a great company.
But we cannot take the security risks of any of those companies, including Huawei, which as you know, we put a halt to. But we can't take the security risk.
I think our attitude on China has changed greatly since the China virus hit us. I think it changed greatly. It hit the world, and it shouldn't have. They should have been able to stop it. So we feel differently. I just don't know. When you lose——
Q. Can you say what other companies?
The President. ——when you lose so many thousands of people, and—you know, ultimately, it'll be millions of people around the world. It's a terrible thing that happened to the United States and Europe and the entire world. Really a terrible thing.
Yes, please. Go ahead.
Coronavirus Testing Access and Technology 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I have two quick questions: one on the virus and one on policing. On the virus, you said recently that there can be ""too much testing."" Can you explain what the downside would be from testing too many Americans for the virus and why you haven't provided a date by which all Americans might have the same kind of testing that we have here at the White House?
The President. Well, we do more testing than anybody in the world, as I explained—and I don't mean just a little bit. If you look at India, they're at about 11 million, and we're at 61 million. And there comes a point when you just—you want to focus your testing in a different way. And we'll be announcing some—what we've done is incredible with the testing. Not only the testing——
Q. Is there a downside though? The President. ——not only the number of tests, but also, very importantly, the quality of the test and the machinery itself to do the testing.
Nobody thought it would be possible to get a 5-minute and a 15-minute result that's a very accurate result, and we do, with Abbott. Abbott Laboratories has done a great job. Many of these companies have done an incredible job.
So we're looking at that very strongly. And we're looking at doing something that if we do—if we do it—look, right now what the testing is doing is helpful, but we're spending massive amounts of money, and we want to have it—we want to have it channeled very accurately. We want to be able to help the most people we can.
But we are testing at a level that no country in the world—and I've spoken to the leaders of the world, and they'll ask me about it—no country in the world thought it would be—it's even believable that we're able to test so much. Sixty-one million versus—you know, most countries don't even test. You know when they test? When somebody is feeling badly. If somebody is feeling badly, they're symptomatic, that's when they test. And that's a big difference.
With us, we go around and—looking, because if we find—we find spots. We find hotspots. One problem is, from the standpoint of the media, we end up with far more cases than we would normally show. So it's—you know, as I called it the other day in a statement, I said it's called ""media gold."" You know, for the media, it's gold.
But the truth is, it's—we've done an incredible job on testing. Nobody in the world has done the job. Other leaders have told me the same thing; they can't believe we're able to do it.
Q. And—[inaudible].
The President. And we will continue, but we want to really be able to test, very specifically, the people that are in most danger, most in need.
All right. Please, go ahead.
Q. And, on policing, sir——
Absentee Voting Policies/Florida/New York Democratic Primary Election/Nevada 
Q. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you first about what you tweeted out earlier today, in regards to Florida, and your comfortableness, as it relates to mail-in ballots——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——for Florida. What——
The President. Okay, I'm glad you're asking.
Q. Why does that apply to Florida and it doesn't apply to mail-in balloting across the country?
The President. So Florida has got a great Republican Governor, and it had a great Republican Governor. It's got Ron DeSantis, Rick Scott—two great Governors. And over a long period of time, they've been able to get the absentee ballots done extremely professionally. Florida is different from other States.
I mean, in Nevada, where you have a Governor—he said, ""Let's just send out millions of ballots,"" and the Post Office cannot be prepared; I haven't spoken to the Post Office about it, but I don't know how they could possibly be prepared. Florida has been working on this for years. And they have a very good system of mail-in—and that would be absentee or even beyond absentee. So, in the case of Florida, there aren't too many people that would qualify.
They're so well run. Florida is a very well-run State: low taxes, low everything. They've done a great job, really a great job. And the two Governors, between the both of them, they've really got a great system of absentee ballots and even the—even in the case of mail-in ballots",", the postal services have built up their—you know, it takes a long time.
When you look at the Carolyn Maloney election, I think they—and I'll give you the story: I think you have to do that election over. That election is no good. You have to take a look.
In New York, they have thousands of ballots. They don't know what happened to them. Is there fraud? Is there—it's a disaster. And that's only for a relatively small number of ballots. But I think they have to do the election in New York over.
The Times wrote a big story about it yesterday, front page story. It's a disaster. It's a mess. And they have to do that—I think they have to do that election over. Nobody can know what the election result is.
So, in the case of Florida, they've done a great job, and they've had tremendous success with it. But they've been doing this over many years, and they've made it really terrific. So, for Florida, you can mail in your ballots. You don't have to go. In maybe a couple of other States, they've worked out a system, but this took years to do. This doesn't take weeks or months.
In the case of Nevada, they're going to be voting in a matter of weeks. And you can't do that. I can't imagine the Post Office could do it. All of sudden, they're supposed to be dealing in millions of ballots?
But Florida has done a great job, and we have total confidence that if you mail in your ballot in Florida, it's going to matter.
Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much."
"August 05, 2020",The President's News Conference,Donald J. Trump,"Donald J. Trump, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/343260",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1250,"The President. Thank you very much, everybody. It's good to be with you. I'd like to begin by providing an update on my administration's actions to protect American workers as we battle the China virus. Since the virus escaped China, my administration has enacted $3 trillion in economic relief. It's been very, very successful, and you saw that by the numbers that were issued yesterday and the day before, as to used car sales and auto production. They've been incredible numbers actually. Shockingly incredible.
We've been negotiating in good faith with Democrat leaders in the House to extend relief payments. We're negotiating right now as we speak, and we'll see how that works out. But if Democrat leaders put partisan demands aside, we would reach an agreement very quickly. It happened—it would happen very quickly.
In the meantime, my administration is exploring executive actions to provide protections against eviction—eviction is a big problem, very unfair to a lot of people; it wasn't their fault that this virus came from a faraway land—as well as additional relief to those who are unemployed, as a result of the virus.
Very importantly, I'm also looking at a term-limited suspension of the payroll tax, something that has great support from many, many sides, especially some of our top economists and some people that we have great respect for. So we're looking at a suspension of the payroll tax.
The Democrats are primarily interested in a $1 trillion bailout of the poorly run States. We have some States and cities—you know them all; we don't have to go through names—but they've been very poorly run over the years. And we can't go along with the bailout money. We're not going to go along with it, especially since it's not COVID related.
Earlier today I met with a great Governor, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey. He's really done a fantastic job, beyond even the COVID situation, which you've been reading about as it pertains to Arizona, a State that is a model for applying a science-based approach to the decreasing cases and hospitalizations without implementing a punishing lockdown.
Arizona's record in reducing the spread of the virus while maintaining hospital capacity and allowing society to continue functioning—and functioning very nicely, very successfully—is an example that shows how our path forward can work in other States.
Arizona has a record—and a record, really, to be proud of. It's reduced the number of daily new cases by over 75 percent, cut the positivity rate in half, and reduced ER visits by two thirds, all the while keeping the economy functioning and functioning really well.
When cases surged in June, the Vice President and Dr. Birx visited Arizona to consult with Governor Ducey. They had long consultations with Governor Ducey and his staff, and the Vice President has been in constant contact ever since. My administration is also collaborating with the State and local officials across the South and Midwest to provide similar guidance.
We had a great relationship with the representatives in Arizona, and it's been such a successful endeavor. The Federal Government has supplied or delivered more than 400 million pieces of personal protective equipment to Arizona, along with nearly 70,000 vials of remdesivir. We've provided over one—excuse me, we provided over $18 billion in economic support to Arizona, including more than $8.6 billion to support over 80,000 small businesses. So we really have been helping Arizona, and it's gotten tremendous results. Our goal is to protect the most vulnerable, increase recovery rates—you know that; it's something so important—and prevent hospital overcrowding, all the while avoiding the kind of stringent lockdowns that would inflict substantial suffering in the phase—and this phase of the battle. We have the tools, resources, and knowledge to implement a targeted approach as we race to deliver a vaccine.
And we are really working very hard on the vaccine, and we're doing—I think they're doing a fantastic job. I've been meeting with officials of some of the greatest companies in the world and meeting with scientists, and they're getting very close. If not there, they're getting very close. They're testing.
Any proper analysis of infection control measures must take into account the short-term and long-term public health harms, including death caused by a far-reaching shutdown. When you shut down, you have many, many things that happen—from suicides to depression to drinking, alcohol problems, to drug problems, to problems with marriages. Problems with marriages. That—you have people confined to their house, their apartment for long periods of time, it can cause a lot of problems with that also.
Instead, Arizona has adopted the following measures: The Governor advised residents to aggressively social distance when possible and maintain strict hygiene. The State encouraged mask use in crowded public places, especially when social distancing is not possible. The Governor also exercised his discretion to restrict capacity at indoor locations to limit the possibility of super spreading. It's a big thing.
My administration surged treatments. We got them a lot of treatments and therapies to the State, including nearly 70,000 vials of remdesivir, enough to treat over 11,000 patients, and it's been very successful, I might add.
My administration also delivered PPE and point-of-care testing to over 100 Arizona nursing homes. In total, the Federal Government has provided massive amounts of masks and equipments and gowns, and you know some of those numbers. But Arizona was a very big beneficiary, and they very much received—very much really appreciated.
More than 1,000 National Guard and medical personnel have also been deployed in Arizona, and they've really helped. They've been terrific, and I want to thank them. They have been brave and brilliant, combination of both.
We also supported our Tribal communities. The Tribal communities were hit very, very hard. Governor Ducey and I personally delivered rapid testing systems to the Navajo Nation, which has been really, really in originally bad shape and now getting better and very, very quickly. The Navajo Nation now has one of the highest levels of testing per capita anywhere in the world. We really worked very hard on the Tribal areas. And in particular, in this case, the Navajo Nation, they've done incredibly well.
Overall, Arizona has conducted over 1.1 million tests, more than the entire nations of Japan, Mexico, and Switzerland. Arizona's per capita testing is higher than Germany, South Korea, France, and Canada. And Tribal governments in Arizona have received nearly $1.3 billion for the Coronavirus Relief Fund.
Meanwhile, outdoor dining, limited indoor dining, and most of the other businesses in Arizona have remained open and very vibrant. They're doing incredibly well. This is an approach, and it's an approach that's been incredibly successful. Arizona has been able to protect high-risk populations and quickly bring its outbreak under control without the need to impose overly punitive measures. Thanks to advances in treating the virus, the fatality rate across all age groups in Arizona is very low. Arizona's scientific and data-driven strategy also preserved hospital capacity, ensuring that those who need care were able to receive it and receive it immediately, very quickly.
At the peak, approximately 15 percent of beds remained available statewide—that was at their peak—with roughly 20 percent of all occupied beds going to patients hospitalized for the virus. They kept other things going. They kept other forms of operations going. They kept elective surgery going. Did a really amazing job.
Today, only 6 percent of the current hospitalizations in the State are related to the China virus. Arizona has also demonstrated success in protecting the State's African American population. Only 5 percent of patients hospitalized were African American, and African Americans represent just 2 percent of all deaths from the virus.
As it has worked to contain its outbreak, Arizona has also been formulating a plan to get children safely back to school as soon as possible. We want our schools open all over the country. We want our schools open. Arizona has worked very hard on this, and they're doing very well. The Department of Education is providing Arizona schools with $625 million—they're working very hard—and that's in conjunction with CARES funding.
My administration is actively working with other States in the same way we worked with Arizona. In recent weeks, members of the Coronavirus Task Force have visited over 15 States to encourage them to follow our path forward, including Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, Indiana, and Ohio. And I'll be going to Ohio tomorrow. I look forward to it very much. It's a great place and a great State with an excellent Governor, and we look forward to being there tomorrow.
Next week, Dr. Birx will be visiting Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Arkansas—and also, I believe they're trying to get in West Virginia, a great place, a great State, and I'm sure that will happen, because we'd like it to happen. They'd like to see her. So we're going to try very hard to get the doctor to West Virginia in addition to those States—to deliver aggressive, tailored, and targeted guidance.
The strategy we're taking to these States will protect those at highest risk while allowing others at a lower risk to safely resume work and school. If we do this successfully, it can be really something incredible, because we're talking about a lot of States. We're talking about many, many States.
It's really great to see also that Florida, we're coming down—it's coming down and pretty substantially in many locations. And even Miami is starting to come down. Miami was hit very hard. California likewise, and Texas likewise, coming down and really starting to be a substantial amount of reduction.
It recognizes that prolonged lockdowns impose a wide range of serious public health threats, including higher levels of suicide, drug overdoses, and other significant health harms resulting from the depression that we talked about—social isolation, economic hardship. It's been very tough for those people that are put in a lockdown position for too long. It really has been a very tough and harmful situation for many people.
The fact is that these harms are not measured daily here or abroad. It makes them really a very serious threat because people don't know exactly what they are and how bad they are, but I think they're very bad.
Going forward, we must continue to remain vigilant in shielding the elderly and those with underlying conditions. Approximately half of all deaths have occurred in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, which is an incredible number and statistic, if you think about it. I also urge Americans to help us stop the spread of the virus: practice good hygiene, socially distance, avoid large crowds, and wear a mask where distancing is not possible. It's a patriotic thing to do. If you are sick, isolate yourself, especially from high-risk family members and friends. So important: Isolate yourself from high-risk family members and friends if you're not feeling well.
Together, we will defeat the virus and emerge from this safer and stronger than ever. Thanks to the robust Federal action in partnership with State and local leaders, new cases of the virus are declining in 80 percent of the jurisdictions, which is an incredible number, and the overall test positivity rate has declined by 8 percent since last week. Zero States have seen outbreaks get worse since yesterday—so zero States.
We're also continuing to make progress in the development of a vaccine. This is something so important. Also, therapeutics are on the front burner. We're having tremendous, I think—we'll let you know very soon, I think long before the end of the year—we're having tremendous success on therapeutics and tremendous success on vaccines, and we're ready to deliver them literally as soon as they're okayed.
This morning my administration approved $1 billion for Johnson and Johnson, who's been working very hard—and they think they have something very special—to manufacture and distribute 100 million doses of a China virus vaccine as soon as one is available. And again, we think that's going to be soon, and we think we're going to have the vaccines before the end of the year, maybe long before the end of the year.
Finally, today I'm pleased to announce that the Department of Justice has issued $35 million in grants to 73 organizations nationwide, providing assistance to human trafficking victims. A terrible thing. You think of human trafficking as being an ancient form of crime. It's not. Because of the internet, it's a very modern crime all over the world, not just here—all over the world—human trafficking. It's usually in women or women and children. But it's—again, because of the internet, it's a terrible situation. Never been like this.
And also, survivors who face heightened dangers during the pandemic—it's actually increased during the pandemic. I guess, some reasons are obvious, and some reasons are less obvious. But human trafficking, we're working very, very strongly.
The wall is up to 277 miles right now, and it's going up by the end of the year. It will be largely finished, shortly after the end of the year. And it's had a tremendous impact, a very positive impact on human trafficking. Unbelievable impact, actually.
My administration will never rest in our fight against the human trafficking. To me, it's one of the most horrific of crimes, and we work very hard on that.
With that, we'll take some questions. Please.
2020 Presidential Election/Absentee Voting Policies/Potential Voter Fraud Risks/New York Democratic Primary Election 
Q. Two quick questions. Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, you said that voting by mail is an invitation to fraud. Could you lay out and tell us exactly where the evidence is right now that mail-in ballots in Nevada and other States will lead to widespread fraud?
The President. Well, if you read, even the Washington Post had a terrible story on mail-in and the New York Times. And many, many newspapers have had terrible stories. You see them all over the internet. They've had some just horrible stories on mail-in ballots.
You look at Arizona [Nevada]*, you don't even have to have—as you know, they have a provision where they don't have to check signatures. So you sign it, and you could have a totally different signature. It's okay. It won't be approved. They have the right to go 7 days after the election for approval, so you're not even going to know who won the State of Nevada.
Q. Were you—oh, you're talking about Nevada. Oh, I just want to point out we did call Nevada's Secretary of State's Office Election Division, and the spokeswoman there said that that simply isn't true, Mr. President, and that Nevada will continue to check ballot signatures against voter registration cards. It's done at the county level.
The President. Okay, but that's not what they said when they approved it. They said they're not going to check signatures; they're not going to be able to. And their machinery, which is old, doesn't allow them to. So they're going to be—it's going to be physically impossible for them to do that, especially in a short period of time.
In addition, you have the November 3 election, and they're allowed to count votes until 7 days after the election. So what does that mean? If—if Nevada, which is a big State and a great State, a State I like very much—and I think we're going to do very well there—are we going to wait a week after November 3? If it comes down to Nevada, which it could very well. I don't think so. I don't think it's appropriate.
So, with all of the bundling that you're going to have, with the harvesting you're going to have, with people being sent ballots all over that have, maybe, nothing to do with the State anymore, it's a terrible thing.
In New York, they had the Carolyn Maloney situation. And I criticized it badly over the last 2 years and—2 days. I mean, I gave it some very, very strong criticism, and all of a sudden, like a miracle, they just approved the winner. Well, what happened? Did the person that was second concede the race even though it was very close and all mixed up?
They have a terrible situation in New York with the ballots. You know that. And as soon as I said, ""Well, I think you should have a new election""—because the election, obviously, they're not going to know what to do—""I think you should have a new election,"" they, all of a sudden, announced a winner. I assume it was her. But they announced the winner.
Well, I don't agree with it. Did somebody speak to the person on the other side, the opponent? Did they do something for the opponent on the other side?
Take a look at Paterson, New Jersey. Take a look at many things. It's all over newspapers what's going on with the mail-in ballots. They vote—they send out millions of ballots—millions of ballots. They're totally unprepared to do it, and then they come back in the millions. It's going to be a disaster.
I'm doing our country a big favor by bringing it up. And you know, from a common-stance point, even—commonsense standpoint, if you look at it just out of common sense and pure, basic, beautiful intelligence, you know it can't work.
Now, Florida has worked very hard for years and years on developing a system, and I'm sure they probably have problems also. But absentee ballots are different than mail-in ballots—what you call ""universal mail-in ballots."" They're much different. You have to apply for it. You have to do different things, and it's a much better system, and it's a system that can be reasonably accurate. But there's no system like going to the poll and voting.
So I would like to find out why, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, in the midst of all of this grief, why is it that they approved the New York race? Why you asked that question. Q. Well, the Maloney race, sir, there's no evidence of widespread voter fraud there.
The President. Which one?
Q. Carolyn Maloney's primary.
The President. Oh, really? Well, then you're reading—then you're reading a different newspaper than me.
Q. Well, the issues have to do with delays related to the delivery and the postmarking and the mail, sir.
The President. Go ahead, please. Go ahead, please. Go.
Coronavirus Cases in the U.S 
Q. Sir, you said in an interview this morning on the coronavirus: ""This thing is going away. It will go away like things go away,"" despite ongoing cases and deaths.
The President. It's going away.
Q. Isn't that showing you are out of touch with reality?
The President. It's going away. It's going away. No, it will go away like things go away. Absolutely. It's——
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. ——no question in my mind it will go away.
Please, go ahead.
Q. Yes, Mr. President, you praised——
The President. Hopefully, sooner rather than later.
School Reopening Efforts/Arizona 
Q. Mr. President, you praised Governor Ducey's handling of the epidemic in his State. One of the things that he did was delay the start of public schools opening. Is that a model that governors and States experiencing hotspots should—should do as the beginning of school does approach?
The President. Well, I'd like to see the schools open. I think many of the schools—most of the schools will be open. I can say that Republican areas want to see them open, and the Democrats probably want to keep them closed until after November 3 because they think it's good for them politically. I actually don't think it's good for them politically.
Parents want the schools open. We want them open. We want them open safely. We're going to practice very strong hygiene and all of the other things that I've enumerated many times. But we want to see the schools open.
Yes. Please, go ahead.
Q. And, Mr. President, you're encouraging schools—States to follow Governor Ducey's model here. And what part of that model was——
The President. No, not his model. I just think he's done a very good job. I mean, he's really done a great job. If you look at the numbers, you look at how it's dropped, and very rapidly—he's done a great job. He's a great Governor.
Please. School Reopening Efforts/Coronavirus Transmission Among Children 
Q. In the interview this morning, Mr. President, you were talking about opening the schools, and you said children are ""virtually immune"" from COVID-19. But children have contracted this virus and some have died from it.
The President. Well, when I say that, I'm talking about from getting very sick. If you look at children, I mean, they're able to throw it off very easily, and it's an amazing thing, because some flus, they don't. They get very sick and they have problems with flus, and they have problems with other things.
But for whatever reason, the China virus, children handle it very well. And they may——
Q. [Inaudible]—said ""virtually immune.""
The President. ——they may get it, but they get it, and it doesn't have much of an impact on them. And if you look at the numbers, the numbers of—in terms of mortality, fatality, the numbers for children under a certain age, meaning young, their immune systems are very, very strong. They're very powerful, and they—they seem to be able to handle it very well, and that's according to every statistic.
Q. But is it right that they're ""virtually immune""?
The President. Yes, please, go ahead.
Independent Presidential Candidate Musician Kanye O. West/Presidential Pardons and Commutations 
Q. Mr. President, at least two people connected to Kanye West's effort to get on the ballot have been connected to the Republican Party. Is this some——
The President. Whose—whose ballot?
Q. To Kanye West's.
The President. With Kanye West? Oh.
Q. He's getting on the ballot, including in swing States. And, as you know, his wife has raised issues about whether he's having mental issues right now. So my question to you is——
The President. That Kanye West does? I don't know that. Who said that?
Q. His wife said he might be going through an episode.
The President. I don't know about that.
Q. But anyway, my question to you is——
The President. I like him. I mean, I like him. He's always been very nice to me.
Q. Are you aware of any efforts——
The President. He's talking about Kanye West.
Q. Are you aware of or have you encouraged anyone in the party to help him get on the ballot, including in swing States?
The President. No, not at all. No, not at all, other than I get along with him very well. I like him. I like his wife. His wife recommended certain people, as you know, for—including Alice Johnson, who's a fantastic woman. But his wife recommended certain people to get out of prison. They were in prison for a long time—a long, long time. It should have never happened, and I took what she said very strong—Kim. Kim Kardashian. And, you know, he's got a good heart, very good heart. And I like Kanye very much. No, I have nothing to do with him getting on the ballot.
Independent Presidential Candidate Musician Kanye O. West 
Q. Do you think it helps you, Mr. President?
The President. We'll have to see what happens. We'll see if he gets on the ballot, but——
Q. Mr. President——
The President.——I'm not involved.
Q. ——on Beirut.
The President. Please.
Airline Industry/Economic Stimulus Legislation 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you: The group of Republican Senators who are backing $25 billion in payroll assistance to keep the airlines being able to pay their payrolls, do you, you know, endorse that plan?
The President. They're doing what? Republican Senators are doing——
Q. Republican Senators want to go ahead with another $25 billion for airlines to keep their payrolls going. Do you——
The President. Well, if they need it. Certainly, that's a business—some businesses are doing better than they would normally. Obviously, we know what those businesses are, and obviously, the airline business is not doing very well. You have shutdowns all over the world, and you have airlines that are essentially shut down. Some airlines are doing, you know, modest—best they're doing is modest. I think it's very important that we keep the airlines going. There will be very good times, very soon, I hope. And we don't want to lose our airlines.
So if they're looking at that—whether they're Republican or Democrat—I'd be certainly in favor. We can't lose our transportation system.
Yes, go ahead.
Port Warehouse Explosion in Beirut, Lebanon 
Q. I wanted to ask you, too, on Beirut. So there's been some question about your comments yesterday saying that it was an attack and that you'd heard from military officials that there was, you know, an explosion, that it looked like some sort of a bomb.
The President. Well, they don't really know what it was. I can't tell you, whatever happened, it's terrible, but they don't really know what it is. Nobody knows yet.
At this moment, they're looking. It could—I mean, how can you say ""accident""? Somebody was—you know, left some terrible explosive-type devices and things around, perhaps. Perhaps it was that. Perhaps it was an attack.
I don't think anybody can say right now. We're looking into it very strongly. Right now it's—I mean, you have some people think it was an attack, and you have some people that think it wasn't.
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. In any event, it was a terrible event. And a lot of people were killed, and a tremendous number of people were badly wounded, injured. And we're standing with that country. You know, we have a very good relationship with that country, but it's a country under—there's a lot of turmoil, a lot of problems, but we stand with them.
Q. One more, Mr. President——
Republican Presidential Nomination Acceptance Speech Location 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. You said earlier today that you are considering using the White House as the venue for your——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——nomination speech. Senator John Thune questioned whether or not that's actually legal, given the Hatch Act. Is this something that you would get clearance for before proceeding?
The President. John Thune did, right?
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. The Republican, John Thune? Oh, okay. Well, it is legal. There is no Hatch Act, because it doesn't pertain to the President.
But if I use the White House, we save tremendous amounts of money for the Government, in terms of security, traveling. If we go to another state or some other location, the amount of money is, you know, very enormous, so that's something to consider also.
I think it would be a very convenient location. It would be, by far, the least expensive location. There'd be very little in terms of that tremendous traveling security with airplanes and everybody flying all over the place.
So I think it would be a very convenient idea. It's something that we threw out. It would be very cost-conscious by comparison to any other location.
Yes, please.
Conservation Efforts/Alaska/Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) 
Q. Mr. President, yes—your son, Don Jr., tweeted yesterday asking you to direct the EPA to reject the Pebble Mine in Bristol Bay, Alaska. It's a giant copper and gold mine. And the thinking is that——
The President. Rejected in what way?
Q. Just reject its construction maybe. The Army Corps of Engineers, 2 weeks ago, suggested it would be okay to proceed with the project, but it would—sportsmen, like your son, are saying that it would be harmful to fisheries.
The President. Well, I'd listen to both sides. I don't know of the argument yet, but I would certainly listen to both sides. My son has some very strong opinions, and he is very much of an environmentalist. And he was very impressed with what we did yesterday, because that's one of the great environmental bills, and beyond that, ever signed since—well, I guess over 100 years, if you think about it. It's been a long time.
But I will look at both sides of it. I had heard about it. I will be—I understand they're going to be doing a briefing sometime over the next 48 hours. It's going to go very quickly. I've done a lot for Alaska. I love Alaska. It's a special place. ANWR was one thing. The highway—Cove highway, or whatever the new name is, whatever the old name is. We're getting approvals for a tremendous highway that's been sought for 40 years. They've been trying to get it approved, and I'm getting it approved. We've done a lot for Alaska; it's a special place. And I'll take a look at that. That's interesting.
Yes, please, go ahead.
Ambulatory First Responders Compensation 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Two brief questions. First, your administration has praised ambulance drivers and the ambulance service for their role in dealing with the coronavirus.
The President. Sure.
Q. And recently, there has been scuttlebutt that the Ambulance Association's drivers and all have not been fully reimbursed for the work they're doing. They said they are owed $2.89 billion and they've only received $300 million from the Provider Relief Fund.
The President. Not $300 billion, no. Not 300——
Q. Million.
The President. Not 300. You mean $300 million?
Q. ——at the Provider Relief Fund at HHS. Are you going to look into this or——
The President. I will. I just heard of it for the first time. The ambulance people have done an incredible job, as have the doctors, the nurses, the frontline workers. Law enforcement has been incredible, the military, FEMA. I mean, I could name almost every group. I can't tell you of a group that's done poorly. But the ambulance people have done a very—it's a tough job too. Very dangerous job. Very tough job.
I will certainly look into it. I mean, you're telling me something that—for the first time. Nobody is complaining about not getting paid too much, but we'll take a look at the ambulance drivers.
Port Warehouse Explosion in Beirut,"," Lebanon 
Q. The other thing: Secretary Esper said today that, based on what he had heard—the incident in Beirut, he felt, was an accident. Now, he's disagreed with you on other things before. Do you have any comment about his remarks?
The President. Yes, I know. Whatever he—if he—if that's what he heard, I think that—I've heard it both ways too. I've heard ""accident""; I've heard, you know, ""explosives."" And obviously, it must have been some form of explosives. But whether it was a bomb intentionally set off—it ended up being a bomb. But no, I've heard it both ways. It could have been an accident, and it could have also been something that was very offensive. And I wouldn't be very happy with that.
Q. And you have no problem with him?
Port Warehouse Explosion in Beirut, Lebanon 
Q. And just to follow up on that, Mr. President: Even if just have suspicion that the Beirut explosion is a bomb, do you have any plans pertaining to U.S. assets in the region, for example? I mean, how are you looking into this?
The President. We're working very closely with the Government, and we're working very closely with many different agencies, including the military. And we'll be able to figure it out. We already, probably, have figured it out.
Thank you very much, everybody.
Q. A follow-up, Mr. President. A follow-up? The President. Thank you."
"August 07, 2020","The President's News Conference in Bedminster, New Jersey",Donald J. Trump,"Donald J. Trump, The President's News Conference in Bedminster, New Jersey Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/343274",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-bedminster-new-jersey,"The President. Well, thank you very much. And it's a great honor to have everybody here. And I know the press was not quite expecting this, so I appreciate your being able to attend. We have a terrific number of things, and some very positive things to tell you tonight.
I want to begin by giving an update on the economy. Economic health is vital to public health. That's why our strategy to kill the China virus has focused on protecting those at greatest risk while allowing younger and healthy Americans to safely return to work and safely return to school. Very important.
We added 1.8 million new jobs in July, exceeding predictions for the third month in a row, and adding a total of over 9.3 million jobs since May. And I will say that the job growth that we've seen over the last 3 months—9.3 million—is the single greatest 3-month period of job creation in American history. That's big stuff. That's big news and great news.
Over the past 3 months, the United States has surpassed market expectations by a total of 12 million new jobs. Over the last 3 months, the United States has added 623,000 manufacturing jobs. Remember: ""You'd need a magic wand to get manufacturing jobs""? And we're getting them even in a pandemic—which is disappearing; it's going to disappear.
And 639,000 brandnew construction jobs. Over half of the new jobs are full-time jobs, and wages are up by 4.8 percent, which is terrific. Unemployment has fallen by nearly 30 percent since April. Think of that: 30 percent since April.
Hispanic American unemployment has decreased by nearly 32 percent. Jobs held by African Americans, which were hit especially hard by the shutdowns—incredibly hard—increased by nearly 1 million over the past 3 months, and that's also a record. That's a job record: African American, 1 million. It's job record.
We must ensure that the progress continues. My administration has enacted over $3 trillion in historic relief since China allowed the virus to infect the world. So we've contributed $3 trillion.
My administration continues to work in good faith to reach an agreement with Democrats in Congress that will extend unemployment benefits; provide protections against evictions; a terrible thing happens with evictions. Not fair. It wasn't their fault that we were infected with this disease from China. And get relief to American families.
Yet, tragically, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer continue to insist on radical leftwing policies that have nothing to do with the China virus. Nothing to do with it at all. So you have a virus that comes in, and you have people in Congress that don't want to help our people.
If Democrats continue to hold this critical relief hostage, I will act, under my authority as President, to get Americans the relief they need. And what we're talking about is deferring the payroll tax for a period of months till the end of the year. And I can extend it at a certain period. Hopefully, I will be here to do the job. We're going to do the job; we've been doing a job like nobody could. Nobody would, actually. And so we're going to have the payroll tax go till the end of the year, and it will be retroactive to July 1. So we're going to go back to July 1, and it will go to the end of the year—payroll tax. At the end of the year, it may be extended. We're going to enhance unemployment benefits through the end of the year. So unemployment benefits will be—that's a big one—will be brought out to the end of the year. And defer student loan payments and forgive interest until further notice—so students who are paying student loans and, in many cases, they're not even allowed to go back into their colleges. Extend the eviction moratorium—we will be extending that so people aren't evicted. Not their fault.
We had a lengthy discussion this morning with President Macron of France, concerning numerus subjects, but in particular, the catastrophic event which took place in Beirut, Lebanon. Horrible, horrible event.
At 3 p.m. this afternoon I spoke with President Aoun of Lebanon to inform him that three large aircraft on the—are on the way, and they're fully loaded—fully loaded with medical supplies, food, water, and many other things, lots of emergency equipment. Also first responders, technicians, doctors, and nurses are on their way. This was an event like the world has not seen for a long time. A horrible event.
We'll be having a conference call on Sunday with President Macron, leaders of Lebanon, and leaders from various parts of the world. Everyone wants to help. We spoke to a lot of people; they all want to help.
The United States is with authorities on the ground right now in Lebanon to identify further health and humanitarian needs, and we will provide further assistance in the period to come. We're working very closely with their Government and with their leaders.
And on behalf of the United States, I want to extend our condolences to all of the families—a much larger number of families than anybody would have thought and than anybody at first thought—but all of those families who lost loved ones, relatives, friends in this horrible tragedy. We stand firmly with the people of Lebanon and will continue to offer our full support through this very difficult time. We have not seen anything like this in a long time.
As you know, earlier this week I met with American workers at the Tennessee Valley Authority who have been laid off by the leadership at the Tennessee Valley Authority. As you know, this is a form of utility. It's been around for a long time, since FDR.
And the head person—not controlled by Government, but it's sort of semipublic, in a sense—gets paid the highest salary in the world of Government. He gets $8 million a year. That's not a bad amount of money. It's $8 million a year. And we are not accepting that. Even though we're not the ones that appoint him or her—but, in this case, him—we're not accepting somebody getting paid $8 million a year. This has been going on for many years. And we will do something about that, and we're already in negotiations right now, including possible termination.
They and hundreds of their fellow American tech workers—the workers at the TVA—were being terminated from their positions on top of all of this and on top of the $8 million salary and a chief of staff who makes much more than a million dollars a year. But, on top of all that, they were being terminated from their positions—these incredible people—in order to train the lower-cost foreign workers imported to replace them. How's that for a law? And this was set up, originally, to create jobs and economic development, and now they're getting fired, and they're supposed to train people for a much lower—who get a much lower salary. It's crazy.
This was a grave injustice. I fired the Chairman of the Board in response. On Friday, I fired the Chairman of the Board, along with one other Board member. That's the one thing we have; we have the right to fire Board members. And I made it clear that if they did not swiftly reverse course, I would continue with these firings of the Board members. And we just were informed that they have agreed to change course, totally. And today I'm proud to announce that a major victory for the workers of Tennessee and Kentucky and other areas that are covered—great States, great States—that the leadership of the TVA has canceled all of the layoffs and given hundreds of American workers their jobs back. They're being rehired as we speak.
In this administration, we live by two rules: Buy American, and hire American. You can't do that; you can't fire all our workers and hire people back from other faraway parts of the world at lower prices, especially when they have to train the people. And they can never train them as good as what you have, because they've been there for many years. They've done a fantastic job, and they love the TVA.
We had a lot of people in the office the other day; a lot of the media was covering it. They love the Tennessee Valley Authority. So—and they're so proud to work for it. But this happened, and it was a terrible thing, so now they're going to get their jobs back—they're all going to be getting their jobs back.
Nearly every nation on Earth continues to combat the virus. A number of countries are seeing a surge in new cases, including Japan, the Philippines, major parts of Europe. Cases continue to surge in Latin America. That's, right now, the most infected place anywhere in the world. They have more than doubled in recent days. Latin America is doing very little testing. They're not really equipped to do that. It's tough.
In the United States, more than 80 percent of jurisdictions report decline in cases. We're doing very well. You don't hear that too often from the media, but we're doing very well. We have a very large country, very complex country, in a sense. More than half of America's counties report fewer than 20 cases last week. So, if you look at that, more than half of America's counties report fewer than 20 cases last week. But we have to remain vigilant. We're doing very well, but we have to remain vigilant.
Nationally, the percentage of emergency room visits with the coronavirus symptoms is down to almost half what it was in July. The southern States that were very strong hotspots not long ago—Arizona, Texas, Florida—continue to show significant improvement, including increased availability of hospital beds.
Arizona now has the smallest number of coronavirus in-patients. Since mid-June, it's gone—the Governor was up, and we had a great meeting—Governor Ducey. And the meeting was terrific. But since mid-June—so they're doing well, and it's going down—heading down very rapidly, actually.
Texas is stabilizing and improving rapidly with some progress in the Rio Grande Valley, and other communities along the border with Mexico that had shown the biggest increases in hospitalizations and deaths.
Florida is also stabilizing, and statewide positive test rate continues to decrease: from 13 percent on July 23, to 8 percent this week. Florida has done very well. It's going down; it's heading down, actually, quite rapidly. And even Miami, which was the hottest spot in Florida, is heading downward. But Florida has done very well.
Texas has done very well, and rapidly. And Arizona has done incredibly well. So it—Arizona has really been a very rapid drop.
New Jersey and New York remain stable with less than 1 percent of emergency room visits due to the China virus, the illness. It took a devastating toll on both States, as you know. While both States really took the brunt of the infection earlier this year, thankfully, we have not seen a resurgence. They've been doing a good job. Everybody is working very hard. Both Governors are working very, very hard. We're in touch with them. We're supplying them with a lot of supplies as needed, if needed. But they're needing very little right now. They're in very good shape. We will continue to monitor the new cases.
Throughout this crisis, my administration has provided extraordinary support of people, equipment, medical supplies to the people of New Jersey, the people of New York, and to the people of every State—all of our States.
We're carefully monitoring California's Central Valley, as well as San Diego, Los Angeles, Sacramento, and San Francisco, which are starting to stabilize and go down. We're carefully watching regions from increasing cases, including Boston and Chicago, as well as the Midwest. We're watching them all very carefully. It's vital that all Americans work together to protect the vulnerable.
For this reason, we've delivered vast amounts of protective equipment and testing supplies to nursing homes all across America. We're focused very much on the elderly, especially the elderly where they have heart problems or diabetes problems. Diabetes is a big problem. Approximately half of all deaths have occurred in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. That's an incredible number, when you hear half of the deaths have been in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.
And I will tell you that I met with owners and representatives of nursing homes, and they are very, very vigilant. They're doing a very good job now. They've really done something that I think is special. They're doing very well, in terms of the virus. They're working very hard. And a lot of things happen—a lot of forces came together and hit the nursing homes very hard. But the representatives of nursing homes—in some cases, the ownership of nursing homes—they're working very hard.
The Federal Government and the private sector have delivered more than 9 million N95 masks, 27 million surgical masks, 3 million face shields, 20 million gowns, and 668 million gloves to New Jersey alone. Think of that. We've provided $3.4 billion to the State of New Jersey in emergency relief funding. So we happen to be in New Jersey right now, so those are great numbers. The Governor is working very hard; Governor Murphy is doing a good job. We're working very closely with him. We've also provided nearly $5 billion to New Jersey hospitals and health care facilities.
And through the Paycheck Protection Program that you all know so well, we provided $23 billion to support more than 250,000 New Jersey small businesses. A lot of the small businesses that you see that are opening now and going to do well, they're there because of what we did with Paycheck Protection.
On therapeutics and vaccine updates: Three vaccine candidates have now moved into phase three trials. This would be years ahead of schedule. We have done wonders with the FDA. I want to thank the FDA and all of the great people there and Dr. Hahn. But we have phase three trials already going on, which is, most people would have said, impossible to even think about.
Today Pfizer announced that it will manufacture Gilead's drug, remdesivir, where we've had tremendous success. Last week alone, my administration procured and distributed over 120,000 vials of remdesivir, enough to treat more than 19,000 patients. Plasma treatments continue to show incredibly encouraging results, really incredible what's going on. And if you can go to a blood bank—if you've had this disease and beat it, and there are a lot of people that have—if you could go to a blood bank and donate, that would be a tremendous help.
The United States is only 5 percent of the world's population, but we have conducted over 25 percent of the world's testing. Think of that: 5 percent, and we've given 25 percent of the world's testing. Any proper global analysis of confirmed cases must really take this into account, because we're constantly showing cases, cases, cases; cases are up. Well, the reason cases are up, because we're doing—one of the reasons—we're doing a lot of testing.
We're doing much more testing than anyone else. Close to 65 million tests, where other countries have done very little testing. They'll test people if they get sick. They'll test people if they go into the hospital. They'll test certain people. We're doing tremendous testing. And we're especially doing big testing at the nursing homes.
Over the last week, the testing turnaround times have declined significantly as our major commercial labs have begun pooling samples. And we've also been able to send out many more of the tests, which are the 5-minute to 15-minute-result tests. Testing samples from multiple patients in one batch is also something that we're very focused on and doing. But, in the not-too-distant future, we'll have so many tests where it's a quick test—they call it a ""quick test""—5 minutes to 15 minutes. So we won't even have to worry too much about the process of sending and receiving. Because if you figure it takes a day to send and a day to receive and, let's say, a day at the laboratory—that's 3 days right there. And the other tests, you can have them in 5 to 15 minutes.
Over the next 2 weeks, I'll be pursuing a major Executive order requiring health insurance companies to cover all preexisting conditions for all customers. That's a big thing. I've always been very strongly in favor—we have to cover preexisting conditions. So we will be pursuing a major Executive order, requiring health insurance companies to cover all preexisting conditions for all of its customers.
This has never been done before, but it's time the people of our country are properly represented and properly taken care of.
This follows a series of Executive orders to lower drug prices and lower prescription drug prices—and significantly. We had the only year, which was last year, where drug prices went down in 51 years. But we're talking about going down at a level that nobody has even thought possible now, even though the drug companies are running very big ads on me, but that's usually a reason—they're not happy. They can't be too thrilled. But they've made a lot of money over the years, and prices just go up. Not fair.
This includes a landmark Executive order requiring drug companies to change Americans—and charge Americans no more than they charge to foreign countries. So they have to charge Americans no more than they charge to foreign countries. That means our country can't be charged more.
So if Germany gets drugs at a very small or low price, and we're paying many times that price in the United States—because we pay for all of the research, the development, the promotion, and other things—we will get what's called a ""favored nations clause."" We're going to have—and I signed a favored nations clause so that the United States—which is the number-one purchaser of drugs by far in the world—biggest purchaser in the world, not even close. You have other countries that are bigger, if you look at India, China, et cetera. Not too many. But we have countries that are bigger, but not even close, in terms of ordering drugs. We're the number-one country in the world.
But we have a favored nation—so if somebody has a drug—in many cases, it comes from a plant—the same plant. It comes from—it's the same pill; it's the same medicine or medication. Whatever the lowest country charges—so if Germany charges 10 cents for a pill and we charge $2—and I only use Germany as an example—then we get that for 10 cents. So what's going to happen is, that's going to go up a little bit, and ours is going to come down a whole lot. So it's the favored nations. And I will tell you that Big Pharma is not happy. For too long, we've been forced to subsidize cheaper drug prices in foreign countries. We've subsidized them to a level that nobody can believe. Nobody talked about it. Everybody wondered: ""How come every President that runs for office says they're going to lower drug prices, and they never do? They go through the right—roof."" Over the last administration they went up, like, skyrocketing—skyrocketing. That's Biden. Biden is not going to be able to be able to do it. He has no clue. [Laughter]
So what's happening is: We are going to be working to get rid of all the subsidy to foreign lands. And we're going to give, essentially, all of the benefit that, frankly, they have as great negotiators—those benefits are going to go to our people. So it's called a ""favored nations clause,"" and you can look it up, and you can see. And nobody has had the courage to institute it, to call it because it's a very big step. But it's something that is going to drive drug prices down 50, 60, maybe even 70 percent. We're talking about numbers that are unbelievable.
I also signed an Executive order stopping middlemen from taking advantage of Medicare patients by charging higher prices to them and pocketing the discounts for themselves. These are some of the richest people in the world. Everyone talked about middlemen. I've heard about them for years, on prescription drug prices—middlemen. I guess you'd have to say to be politically correct, ""middle men and women."" But you never heard the ""middlewomen"" before; you heard ""middlemen."" That's the term.
And you know, say what you want about the drug companies, but at least the drug companies produce a product. They produce the pill. They produce the medicine—the medication. But these people make billions and billions of dollars. I don't know who they are, but they're very rich. But they won't be so rich anymore.
This Executive order requires these $30 billion in discounts to go straight to the American patients. So the middleman is going to be knocked out, and I'm going to lose a lot of friends, even though I have no idea who these people are. [Laughter]
On opioids, I'm pleased to announce that my administration invested an additional $100 million to fight the opioid crisis in rural America. In the midst of the China virus pandemic, we also keep fighting to end the opioid epidemic. And we've done very well. We've done—it was prior to the virus—we were down 18, 19, and 20 percent. But when you think about it, that means that you have 80 percent, and that's not acceptable.
The wall is going up. We have 276 miles of wall. It's having a tremendous impact on drugs coming into our country already. It will be finished toward the end of the year. And it's had a very, very big impact.
On Portland: Finally, I'd like to address that situation. Portland is a disaster. It's been a disaster for many, many years. Brave Federal law enforcement officers singlehandedly—the officers, they singlehandedly saved the Federal courthouse in Portland from lawless rioters and agitators and anarchists—and that's what they are. You know, when you find Molotov cocktails in somebody's knapsack, and they say, ""No, I'm just here to have a good time."" [Laughter] These are really sick, disturbed people.
The disgraced mayor of the city has ordered the police to stand down in the face of rioters, leaving his citizens at the mercy of this mob. He was at the mercy of the mob too. If you saw him go out there the other day, it was terrible. He went out there, and they wanted to rip him apart. But fortunately, he had five people with him called ""security.""
Mayor Wheeler has abdicated his duty and surrendered his city to the mob. As a result, the mob descended upon a police precinct and tried to burn it down, tear it down, rip it down, an act of attempted murder. Left-swing, violent extremism poses an increasing threat to our country, and we stop it. You have no idea how much we stop, but it's an ideology we have to stop.
""When you commit arson""—this is a quote from the mayor; he's come a long way. He just made this quote. ""When you commit arson with an accelerant in the attempt to burn down a building that is occupied by people who have intentionally been trapped inside, you are not a"" demonstrator—or ""you're not demonstrating,"" said, Mayor Wheeler, ""You are attempting to commit murder."" That's come a long way; he's come a long way when he made that statement.
What you're seeing in Portland is the radical left's agenda in action. Portland is their roadmap for America. If the radical left gets in—and they treat Joe Biden as a puppet; he's merely a puppet. But if the radical left gets in, they look at Portland as a thing that they want. That's what they want. Why? Who knows? Doesn't matter. It's a different thinking, but it's a mess.
And I want to thank Homeland Security. They've done a fantastic job. We had our people go in. They stopped any intrusion into the courthouse, and the courthouse was saved, and other Federal buildings were saved. And we would like to be asked by the mayor and the Governor—we will go in and stop the problems in Portland in 24 hours, just like we did in Minneapolis after they really hurt that city. But the National Guard went in, did a phenomenal job.
It was over in 3 hours. After watching 6 days of horror, it ended in 3 hours. You all saw the scene of them walking right down the street, just to—it was actually an unfortunate view, but an incredible view of how to do things.
So we would be able to solve the Portland situation immediately, but we are supposed to be asked. If we're not asked and if it continues, we'll have to make a decision. But it's a very easy thing for us to do. We could stop it very quickly. It's been going on now for 76 days. But our buildings are very secure.
If the Democrats controlled in Washington—the Democrats' control of Washington—they'd pass—with all of the things they do—legislation gutting every single police department in America. They truly do; many of these people want to defund the police department. At a minimum, they're going to stop money from going to the police department, but in many cases they actually wanted to defund, completely, the police department.
No city, no town, and no suburb would be safe. Your suburbs would be a disaster. Your cities, your towns would be a disaster. They want every city to be a Portland or to be a Chicago, which is totally out of control, and we're waiting for the mayor. We've sent people in to help them from an intelligence standpoint, but we're waiting for them to call—the Governor, the mayor. We could do a very good job in Chicago. Nobody's ever seen anything like that—this country.
And yet, nationwide numbers are good, despite the Chicagos and the Portlands—and frankly, the New Yorks, when you look at what's happened in New York. Three hundred and forty-eight percent increase in the last number of months. Nobody has seen anything like that. It's so sad. To me, it's so sad, because I love New York. And it's so sad. And it—all it is, is horrible, horrible incompetent management by politicians that truly don't know what they're doing.
So just like we saved the courthouse, we will save the United States of America. And a vast majority of people agree with me. A vast majority. Most people. They don't speak up as much as they could, but we know they're there, and everybody else knows they're there too.
So, with that, I'll take a few questions from the media. They've been here for a long time, and they've been waiting outside for a long time. And they wait for these moments. So it was a lot of fun. [Laughter]
Please, go ahead. Q. Mr. President——
Executive Action on Coronavirus Relief 
The President. No. You, go ahead.
Q. Me? Oh, thank you, Mr. President. I have a couple of questions on the negotiations with Capitol Hill and the——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——coronavirus legislation. These Executive orders you mention, do you have a timeline on when you're going to sign them or——
The President. Yes, it could be by the end of the week. They're being drawn by the lawyers right now. They work very nicely. It would be nice to be able to do it with the Democrats, but they're really just interested in one thing, and that's protecting people that have not done a good job in managing cities and States. And nothing to do with COVID, nothing to do with—or little to do. They want to be able to make up for many, many years—in some cases, decades—of bad management. We can't do that.
So that's what they want. They want to do that, and we don't want to do that.
Q. Are you concerned that—about the legality of these Executive orders?
The President. No, not at all.
Q. Because there are questions they may be found illegal.
The President. No. If somebody—well, you always get sued. I mean, everything you do you get sued. I was sued on the travel ban, and we won. I was sued on a lot of things, and we won. So we'll see. Yes, probably, we get sued, but people feel that we can do it.
Jeff [Jeff Mason, Reuters], go ahead.
Potential Foreign Interference in the 2020 Presidential Election/Russia-U.S. Relations/China-U.S. Relations/Iran/North Korea/National Economy 
Q. Thank you, sir. Mr. President, the intelligence agencies today said that Russia is already meddling in this year's election to hurt Joe Biden, and that China is considering meddling to hurt you. Do you believe that intelligence? And what do you plan to do about it?
The President. It could be. I mean, it could be—very much. I think that the last person Russia wants to see in office is Donald Trump because nobody has been tougher on Russia than I have, ever.
Q. That's not what the intelligence is showing though.
The President. Well, I don't care what anybody says. Nobody with any common sense would say, do—look at what we've done with our military. Look at what we've done in exposing the pipeline with billions of dollars going to Russia. Look at all of the things we've done with NATO, where I've raised $130 billion a year from countries that were delinquent, and now they're paying all of this money. And the 130, by the way—$130 billion—not ""million,"" ""billion""—goes to $400 billion over a few years. And that's all money to protect against Russia.
China would love us to have an election where Donald Trump lost to Sleepy Joe Biden. They would dream—they would own our country. [Laughter] If Joe Biden was President, China would own our country. And you said another country? What was the third country?
Q. No, just those two. And do you—— The President. No, no. You didn't—you didn't say then the report. The report said Iran, also. But you didn't say that.
Q. I didn't say that.
The President. Iran would love to see me—Iran would love to see me not be President. And I'll make the statement: If and when we win, we will make deals with Iran very quickly. We'll make deals with North Korea very quickly.
And whatever happened to the word ""North Korea""? You haven't seen that, have you? If I didn't win the election in 2016, our country would now be—maybe it would be over by now, but in war with North Korea. Everybody said, ""Oh, Trump will get us in war."" No, it's just the opposite.
And we actually have a relationship with North Korea, which is something that—it was never established by the previous administration. You would have been in war with North Korea, and it would have been a very bad war.
So North Korea—whether you look at Iran—every one of them will make a deal with us very quickly. Iran is dying to make a deal, but they want ","to see, because they'd much rather make a deal with Biden. Because if they make a deal with the United States, if China makes a deal with the United States with Biden in charge, they would own our country.
Look what I've done. I've taken billions—tens of billions of dollars from China. China was having the worst year they've had in 67 years, and we were having the best year we've ever had—with big tax cuts, with big regulation cuts. We've rebuilt our military. We became independent in terms of energy. We're the energy leader of the world. We were having the best year we've ever had.
By the way, African American, Asian American, Hispanic American unemployment numbers—the best in the history of our country. All things—and many other groups too—including women; including high school diploma, no high school diploma, college diploma. Everybody was doing better.
The last thing that Russia wants and China wants and Iran wants would be for Donald Trump to win.
Yes, please. Go ahead.
2020 Presidential Election/Absentee Voting Policies/Potential Voter Fraud Risks 
Q. Just to follow up, what do you plan to do about that interference, sir?
The President. Well, we're going to look at it very closely. You're telling me that this came out a little while ago, and I've heard that it came out. It came out just a little while ago, and we're going to look at that very closely.
But you started off with Russia.
Q. Russia on——
The President. Why don't you start off with China? Do you think China is may be a bigger threat? I mean, I think maybe it is. I mean, you'll have to figure it out. But we're going to watch all of them. We have to be very careful.
The biggest risk that we have is mail-in ballots, because with the mail-in ballots—it's called ""universal mail-in ballots""—it's much easier thing for a foreign power, whether it's Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, many others, people—countries you wouldn't expect—it's much easier for them to forge ballots and send them in. It's much easier for them to cheat with universal mail-in ballots.
So I think one of the things we'll have to look at is exactly that, but that's a big problem. That's a big problem. And you saw, in New York, they called the winner, but they have no idea what the vote is.
Please, go ahead.
Coronavirus Relief Legislation/2020 Presidential Election 
Q. Mr. President, we've watched these negotiations go on for weeks. Do you think if you had been more directly involved, we would be in a different position than we are today?
The President. No, I'm totally involved. No, I—they call me all the time. They tell me how they're doing with Nancy and Chuck. But in my opinion, they're just using it as an excuse to try and—you know, Chuck Schumer came out with a strong statement today that you have to get back into school because it's good for the economy, but he has—he doesn't do it. He doesn't practice what he preaches.
No, my people—Steve Mnuchin and our wonderful Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows—they're constantly on the phone with me. I'm totally involved with it. And we are going to do it in a way that's just much easier. We gave them their chance, but they view it as an election enhancement.
You know, you talk about foreign countries cheating on the election. Well, the Democrats are cheating on the election, because that's exactly what they're doing. If you look at what they're doing, even with these negotiations, that's an influence and an unfair influence on an election. But we're going to win anyway.
Yes. Please go ahead.
Q. Mr. President, when was the last time your spoke to Speaker Pelosi though? We're at this historic moment. Why haven't you spoken to her?
The President. Well, we'll see. We'll see what happens, but right now they're not ready. And they're not ready because, frankly, I don't think they care about people. I think they care about their politicians that have done a terrible job running the cities and States—Democrat cities and States—that are bleeding money, that have been so badly run.
You take a look at Baltimore, and you take a look at so many different cities, including the ones I've already mentioned. Take a look at what's going on. And they want lots of money to keep it going. For many years, they've been bad.
So all I'm doing is, we're having it out. We're finally having it out.
Yes, please.
Coronavirus Relief Legislation 
Q. Mr. President, if you go ahead on your own on unemployment insurance, I'm wondering both where you're going to get the money to pay for that without Congress and will people still get $600 a week?
The President. Yes, we have the money. We have the money. Yes.
Q. They'll still get $600 a week, in addition?
The President. I won't say that yet. You'll see that when it happens, but we have the money.
Q. Will you say what number they would—— The President. We have it, Justin [Justin Sink, Bloomberg News]. We have plenty of money.
Yes. Please go ahead.
Coronavirus Containment Efforts/Potential Interference in 2020 Presidential Election 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You said that the pandemic is disappearing, but we lost 6,000 Americans this week. And just in this room, you have dozens of people who are not following the guidelines in New Jersey which say you should not have more than 25 people——
The President. No, they don't have to. This is a political activity.
Audience members. Booo!
Q. So why are you setting a—why are you setting such a bad example, Mr. President, for the country?
The President. Yes. You're wrong on that, because it's a political activity. They have exceptions. Political activity.
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. And it's also a peaceful protest. [Laughter] So when you have an—and as you know—it's a peaceful protest. They asked if they could be here.
You know, they—a number of—and, to me, they look like they all have—pretty much all have masks on. But you know, you have an exclusion in the law. It says ""peaceful protest"" or ""political activity,"" right? In fact, specifically—yes. It says—exactly—""political activity"" or ""peaceful protests.""
And you can call it ""political activity,"" but I'd call it ""peaceful protests"" because they heard you were coming up. And they know the news is fake. They understand it better than anybody.
Audience members. Yes! [Applause]
The President. They asked whether or not—they asked whether or not they could be here. Like the question about Russia. He doesn't mention Iran was in the report. He doesn't mention—or he mentions very late that China was in the report——
Audience member. China wants Biden!
The President. ——because that's the way they are. They're not——
If the press in this country were honest, if it wasn't corrupt, if it wasn't fake, our country would be so much further ahead. But we're doing really great. [Applause]
Thank you all very much. Thank you."
"August 10, 2020",The President's News Conference,Donald J. Trump,"Donald J. Trump, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/343284",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1252,"The President. Thank you very much. I thought I'd start by talking about some mail-in voting that just was revealed—just the news. Half a million incorrect absentee ballot applications were sent all across the State of Virginia, including to many dead people. This was an unprecedented mailing flub that's heightened concerns about the integrity of expanding mail-in voting and mail-in voting efforts. It's a disaster: all over Virginia, half a million votes. So that's something you have to think about.
We don't want to have a rigged election, I know that. And you have to be very careful when you mention, as you constantly do, Russia or you mention China or you mention Iran or others that attack our election system. And when you have this mail-in voting, it's a—it's very susceptible. It's something that can be easily attacked by foreign countries and by, frankly, Democrats and by Republicans. And I think that it's something you have to start thinking about very seriously.
Our system is not equipped for it. The Post Office is not equipped for it. And people should vote, like they did in World War I and World War II. And your numbers will be—in 90 days or less, your numbers will be very good, I think—much better—on the coronavirus or the China virus. But it's something you have to look about—look at and say, ""This is just crazy.""
This just came out: half a million incorrect ballot applications sent all over the State of Virginia to many people that weren't living. They had some sent to pets, dogs. This is what we're going to get into, and it's going to be a disaster. And it's going to be thought of very poorly, and it's going to hurt our country.
After our news conference Saturday night and the pro-growth announcement—we're pro-jobs, pro-health safety—Executive orders—the stock market went up 358 points today. So we—we issued those Executive orders, and the stock market went up 358 points today. It's quite a reaction.
The Dow Jones and the S&P 500 are now up 50 percent since March—50 percent. Think: If you had money in there, if you put your money in in March, you have 50 percent. The NASDAQ index continues to set new records. It's been up over 14 times; new record in NASDAQ.
And the S&P 500 and the Dow—Dow Jones are going to be—I mean, the way they're going, it looks like they're just about going to be topping records, hopefully, soon.
Secret Service agent. Sir, we're just going to have to step out in the hall—[inaudible].
The President. Excuse me?
Secret Service agent. We will step out outside.
Q. What's going on, Mr. President?
The President. Oh. Excuse me.
[At this point, the President was escorted out of the room. Then, the President returned, and the press briefing resumed.]
The President. So thank you very much. Sorry for that. The—there was a shooting outside of the White House, and it seems to be very well under control. I'd like to thank the Secret Service for doing their always quick and very effective work. But there was an actual shooting, and somebody has been taken to the hospital. I don't know the condition of the person. It seems that the person was shot by Secret Service. So we'll see what happens.
And yes, did you have something? Go ahead.
Shooting Outside of the White House 
Q. Mr. President, do you have any details about the shooting? Were they targeting anyone in and around the White House?
The President. No, we—there are no details. We just found out just now. It was outside of the White House, this area right over here. And they'll have details for you in a little while.
Somebody is taken to the hospital. It seems that the shooting was done by law enforcement at that person, at the suspect. It was the suspect who was shot.
Q. Mr. President——
The President. And this just took place. A couple of people outside—I noticed a man named John Roberts [Fox News], who you know very well——
Q. Yes.
The President. ——he reported that he heard shots. He was outside, and he heard two shots.
Shooting Outside of the White House 
Q. Mr. President, was this a threat toward you, sir?
The President. We don't know yet. We don't know. They're going to find that out.
Shooting Outside of the White House 
Q. Do you know if the individual said anything, sir——
The President. We don't know that, yet. No.
Q. ——or mentioned your name, anything like that?
The President. We don't know that yet.
Q. And you can confirm it was the Secret Service that did shoot the suspect?
The President. It seems to be. Yes.
Q. It seems to be.
The President. It seems to be.
The President's Location During His Absence From the Briefing Room 
Q. Where were you taken, Mr. President? Were you taken to the bunker?
The President. No, we were taken just out over to the Oval Office.
Shooting Outside of the White House/U.S. Secret Service 
Q. What did Secret Service tell you when you were outside of the room?
The President. Just told me, when he came up—you pretty much saw it like I did—he said, ""Sir, could you please come with me?"" So you were surprised. I was surprised, also. I think it's probably pretty unusual. But very, very professional people. They do a fantastic job, as you know. So it seems to me—it seems to be, from what I was said, there was a shooting. It was law enforcement shot someone—seems to be the suspect—and the suspect is now on the way to the hospital. I can't tell you the condition of the suspect.
Q. Was the suspect armed? Was the suspect armed?
The President. There was nobody else injured. There was no other law enforcement injured. And I just want to—and we'll get on to the press conference, but I do want to thank Secret Service. They are fantastic, the job they do.
Shooting Outside of the White House 
Q. Mr. President, was the suspect armed? Do you know? Was he armed?
The President. From what I understand, the answer is yes.
Q. He was armed, Mr. President?
The President. That's what I understand. I don't know. You'll have to ask them that.
Q. [Inaudible]—man or a woman?
Q. With what type of weapon?
The President. I don't know that, no.
Q. Was it a male or a female suspect?
The President. I don't know. You'll have to get that—they'll have a detailed—maybe a briefing for you outside later.
Shooting Outside of the White House 
Q. Did they say anything against you, personally, Mr. President?
The President. I don't know. I didn't ask that question. It might not have had anything to do with me. It might have been something else. But it was on the outside of the premises. The wall, the—as you know, the fencing, especially the new fencing that they put up, is very powerful. But it was on the outside of the White House.
Okay? And they'll have a full report—Secret Service, in a little while, will have a full report.
Shooting Outside of the White House 
Q. Are you rattled by this at all, Mr. President?
The President. I don't know; do I seem rattled? It's unfortunate that this is a world—but the world has always been a dangerous place. It's not something that's unique. The world has been—you look back over the centuries, the world has been a dangerous place, a very dangerous place. And it will continue, I guess, for a period of time.
U.S. Secret Service 
Q. Does this make you think differently about your personal safety inside the White House?
The President. No, I feel very safe with the Secret Service. They're fantastic people. They're the best of the best, and they're highly trained. I don't know if anybody got to walk outside, but there were a lot of terrific-looking people ready to go if something was necessary, people at the highest level of law enforcement. There's nobody like these people.
So they just wanted me to step aside for a little while, just to make sure that everything was cleared outside, because it was right in this area. The President's Decision To Return to the Briefing Room 
Q. Why did you come back, Mr. President? Why did you decide, after that—because obviously, it created a lot of commotion—what made you decide to come back and continue to the briefing?
The President. Well, I didn't even think about not coming back. I said, ""Am I able to go back?"" And they said, ""You'd have to wait a little while."" I waited a little while, as you know, in the Oval Office area. And I said, ""Can I get back now?"" And they said, ""Yes.""
And they have a lot of fortification outside, just in case. But it was one person. Okay?
Shooting Outside of the White House 
Q. Mr. President, when you said the shooting—you said the shooting was outside. How far away from the White House?
The President. Well, they're going to be giving you a full briefing in a little while.
Q. Was it pretty far from the White House? Or was it right in front of that?
The President. I can only tell you, they're going to going to give you a briefing. It was outside of the premises, near the fence, but outside of the premises.
Q. But it was near the fence, so pretty close to here.
The President. Yes, pretty close.
So I was telling you that the Dow Jones and the S&P 500——
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. ——are now 50 percent above the March level. NASDAQ is setting new records. It's already broken the record, despite the situation of having the China virus.
We have new jobs are rising, and unemployment is falling faster than nearly anyone thought. And over the past 3 months, we've created over 9 million jobs, and that's a record—a 3-month record. If you add it up, it's a 3-month record, by far. And we've beaten expectations by 12 million. We're 12 million above expectations, which is pretty remarkable.
Today we had great reports on new job openings. And there's clearly a housing boom, which has been incredible numbers in both housing, and an automobile boom. We've rarely seen anything like it, and it's going on right now in America.
Inventories are at rock bottom. Used car sales are at record levels. And we will have rebuilt—we're doing a rebuilding like nobody has ever seen. It's a big plus for manufacturing and construction. So construction is getting close to record territory. Manufacturing is doing very well. The car companies are doing great.
Very happy for Michigan, the State of Michigan. We have a lot of car companies moving in. A lot of plants are being built and expanded in Michigan and Ohio. There is no reason why the economy can't grow at a 20-percent pace in the third quarter; that would be a record.
And interestingly, it will be a number that's going to be announced before November 3. It gets announced probably around November 1, which is very interesting. But it's going to grow at a very substantial pace, based on all of the numbers we're looking at, and probably a lot more substantial than we originally thought.
We're creating new incentives for work and jobs, and we're also providing much-needed assistance to those who are still suffering from the effects of the pandemic contraction. And the contraction is now—while we have the pandemic, we have a lot of great things happening, in terms of the vaccines and therapeutics, as you know. And I think we'll be making tremendous progress over the next period of a few months.
And certainly, before the end of the year, I think we'll have a vaccine before the end of the year, very substantially, and we may have a therapeutic resolvement very quickly. And frankly, that's the one I'd rather have faster because you'd go in, you'd give a transfusion or a shot to people that are very ill, and they'd be able to come out of the hospital the next day or a few days later.
If the States participate in our cost-sharing unemployment plan—we are going to be doing something very, very interesting with all of the things that we announced on Saturday. I don't have to repeat what they are; you know very well. And we've had some tremendous success already if you look at what's happening with the stock market, and people are very thrilled at what we're doing.
We'd like to get the Democrats to focus on other than what they're focusing on, which is a bailout of poorly running States. We have many great-running States, States that are setting records. And let's see what happens with respect to that.
But the—we're looking at also considering a capital gains tax cut, which would create a lot more jobs. So we're looking very seriously at a capital gains tax cut and also at an income tax cut for middle-income families. We're looking at expanding the tax cuts that we've already done, but specifically for middle-income families, and you'll be hearing about that in the upcoming few weeks, and I think it'll be very exciting.
So a capital gains tax is going to be—a lot of people put to work, and it would be a cut in the capital gains tax and also a cut in the middle-income income tax.
So I now want to just discuss a little, quick brief, and then we'll take a few more questions, but we took some. Who would have known we were going to take questions before we started, right? [Laughter] Is that right, Jennifer [Jennifer Jacobs, Bloomberg News]? But that's the way it happens sometimes.
We want to discuss, if we might, the China virus. And the world continues its fight against this horrible plague. Countries in every continent are seeing increases in cases. We have a rapid increase only in cases where—it's very interesting: Because we're so far ahead of testing, we have more cases. If we had much smaller testing, we'd have fewer, but we feel that having testing is a very important thing.
It's a great record to have. In many ways, we've tested, I guess, close to 65 million people right now, and nobody is even close to that number. No other country is close. India would be second, at 11 million, and they have 1.5 billion people. So we have the number-one testing anywhere in the world, by far. And we also have, I think, the highest quality test. We have a lot of different ones, but we have the highest quality, including the short-term and the lab test. The lab tests take a little bit longer.
And Dr. Birx was telling me, a little while ago, that we're down to 2 days and 2½ days on getting your result on the lab test; the other ones, you get them in 5 minutes to 15 minutes. So that's exciting.
But countries in every continent are seeing increases in cases. In recent days, cases have rapidly increased in Japan and Australia, unfortunately, and they're now experiencing higher peaks than they did in March.
To the south of the border—of our border—cases have continued to surge in Mexico, Central America, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, and throughout Latin America. It's really the hotspot. It's posing a major challenge for this continent. Latin America is now the region with the most number of confirmed cases, by far, despite a relative scarcity of testing. So when you think of that, that means it's pretty much on fire. They're having a hard time, and we're helping them. We're sending them tremendous numbers of ventilators, which we're making by the thousands every month. And we're helping Latin America very much.
It's hard for them to come into the country because we have big sections of wall up now. The new wall is being built, which people don't talk about. They used to talk about nothing but the wall. Now that it's being built, they're not talking about it so much. But it's helped us, because we're up to almost—we're getting close to 280 miles in the most important areas. So that's helping us a lot, in terms of not having people come into the country who are infected with the coronavirus.
This global trend underscores the persistence of the virus, including in nations that apply the strictest and most punishing lockdowns. You have nations that are really tough on the lockdowns, and they're getting hit very hard. That's why my administration is pursuing a science-based approach that protects the most vulnerable, preserves hospital capacity, and focuses on the delivery and development of treatments and, ultimately, the vaccine.
I feel strongly that we will have a vaccine by the end of the year, and it will be put in service maybe even as we get it, because we're all set, militarily. We're using our military to distribute the vaccine. And logistically, there's nobody like this group of people. I meet with them a lot, and they're ready to go. As soon as they have it, they'll be going.
But more importantly, the therapeutics—as I said, I think therapeutics could be great, initially speaking. I think that would be—if I had my choice. But you're going to have them both. You're going to have them both. You're going to have them both very soon too.
At the same time, we urge all Americans to apply commonsense mitigation. You all know what that mitigation is; everybody knows it by heart now.
Nearly half of all of the deaths from the China virus in the United States have occurred in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. That's why we have delivered funding, equipment, and rapid testing to our Nation's nursing homes to protect those at high risk. We're very focused on nursing homes and senior citizens' areas. Anywhere that we have senior citizens, we're very, very focused.
We've delivered over 1,800 rapid point-of-care testing devices—those are very quick—and shipped over 700,000 tests to nursing homes. Nursing homes are being protected like never before.
The United States faces a unique range of challenges that requires our constant vigilance. America is the largest at-risk population of any developed country, by far: 1.5 million residents of nursing homes, about five times that of the United Kingdom and other European countries.
Our country also has a higher prevalence of underlying conditions that this virus targets. Yet we have fewer deaths per capita than the United Kingdom and most other peer nations in Western Europe. So that's an important—we have fewer deaths per capita than the United Kingdom and most other nations in Western Europe and heading for even stronger numbers.
But one person is too much, as far as I'm concerned. It should have never been allowed to happen. It should have never been allowed to escape China.
Nationwide, we continue to see encouraging signs. In the last 7 days, nationwide cases declined by 14 percent, hospitalizations decreased by 7 percent, fatalities decreased by 9 percent. Arizona and Florida are improving rapidly, with fewer patients coming to emergency rooms, by far, as well as decreasing cases, decreasing fatalities, and expected—and expanded hospital capacity. So we have an expanded hospital capacity—it's pretty dramatic when you look at it, meaning we have more room, should we need it. So a lot of tremendous work has been done.
In Texas, likewise, the number of patients going to emergency rooms has dropped from July by more than two thirds. That's a lot. Nevertheless, we continue to monitor Texas very closely—terrific Governor, terrific people working on that whole situation in Texas—especially at its test positivity rate, which rose over 20 percent this weekend.
Overall, cases in Texas are coming down and have stabilized in the border counties—that's, again, where you have the wall and you're next to—in some cases, the wall. And, in some cases, you'll have it very shortly; you'll have it all built within a number of months. But those areas were hit very hard, and they're likely cases from Mexico that come in, back and forth, from the border. They come in legally.
As doctors have found more effective ways to treat patients, the fatality rate continues to improve. Texas has one-sixth the fatality rate of New York and New Jersey that they had in April. And the—if you look at New York and New Jersey, they worked very, very hard, but very heavy density. And they had a lot of different kinds of difficulty.
The fatality rates in Florida and Arizona are between 25 and 33 percent of the peak rates of New York and New Jersey. Again, different climate, a different grouping, a different density—tremendously different density.
In California, the situation is starting to stabilize and improve throughout the major metropolitan areas. Statewide, hospitalizations continue to decline very substantially, with about 20-percent fewer in-patients now than on July 21. California is starting to really show signs of correcting.
We're monitoring regions with increasing cases, including Boston, Chicago, and the Midwest. And we're monitoring them very, very strongly and very, very hard. I do want to say that I think, at the end of a fairly short period of time, you're going to be in very, very good shape all over our country.
Every loss of life is tragic, and all nations must work together to defeat this horrible virus. My administration is going to continue to save as many lives as possible. We are working around the clock—everybody. I mean, it's incredible how hard they're working. And people from other countries—we're working with them also, and they're working very hard. This is something that's now attacked 188 different countries.
There are wide range of factors that determine how the virus impacts a nation such as age, underlining [underlying]* conditions. Underlying conditions is a very big one. If you're sick in any way, if you're—if—especially, they say, heart and diabetes. That's not a good thing to have if you're going to have this, if you're going to catch it. So we're trying to protect especially those people that have problems with their heart or diabetes and levels of preexisting immunity resulting from past exposure to other viruses, which happens.
We must stop politicizing the virus and instead be united in our condemnation of how this virus came to America, how this virus came to the world. And we're going to figure it out, and we're going to find out, and we're very angry about it. On the therapeutics and vaccine updates: Three vaccine candidates are currently in phase three clinical trials—something that would have been impossible under the previous administration or any other administration—and several others are showing considerable promise.
We have great companies, very well-known companies. I think everyone in this room would know these companies, but they're the biggest and the best in the world. And we're working with other foreign companies and countries that have—have been really working very closely with us.
We're trading—we're not looking to do anything but come up with the answer. And we really don't—we don't care; we want to come up with the answer. If it's one of ours or one of theirs, it's okay. We have to come up with the answer, and we're very close to getting it. Some people think we have it. We may have it.
We have the best scientists in the world racing to develop a safe vaccine that will end this pandemic, save millions of lives—and that's millions of lives all over the world—and end the harm inflicted by this virus to our society and to all other nations. Last week, the NIH began a clinical trial of remdesivir paired with another approved antiviral drug—an anti-inflammatory drug. You know that remdesivir has been very successful, and now they're experimenting with others, including antivirals and anti-inflammatories, and they're having some very interesting success. We've secured enough remdesivir to treat over 650,000 patients.
On Saturday, I took executive action in a signing to save American jobs and support American workers. I signed directives to give a payroll tax holiday, with the understanding that after the election—on the assumption that it would be victorious for an administration that's done a great job—we will be ending that tax. We'll be terminating that tax.
On the other hand, the other group wants to raise taxes, and they may want to leave it where you pay it. But the payroll tax is a big deal for people. It's a tremendous saving for people. And we're going to be doing it, and we intend to terminate it at the end of the appropriate period of time. It's for those making less than $100,000, through end of 2020, to provide an extra $400 per week.
Also, in unemployment benefits and to extend the freeze on home evictions—we want to extend the freeze so people aren't evicted. It's not their fault that the virus came from China. It's China's fault.
And to suspend payments on student loans through the end of the year and then beyond. And again, you know, they're paying interest on loans, and they're not allowed to go to their college. So we're going to suspend payments on student loans, through the end of the year. And then, another extension most likely, because it's not fair to the students to have to pay when the colleges aren't doing the job of getting open. And I think, probably, many of them could be open.
So I want to thank you all. I'm sorry for the disturbance before. Things happen. And if you'd like, we could take a few questions.
Yes.
Executive Action on Coronavirus Relief/The President's Team of Advisers 
Q. I have a question. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate it. Kayleigh said earlier today that you've been working around the clock so there's no delay to get these enhancement unemployment payments to Americans.
The President. Yes.
Q. Can you give me your timetable? Are we talking next week, 2 weeks, a month?
The President. Steve, what do you think? Secretary of the Treasury Steven T. Mnuchin. Within the next week or two, we think the States will be able to execute.
Q. So, Mr. Secretary, you're saying when?
Secretary Mnuchin. I think, within the next week or two, most of the States will be able to execute.
Q. Got it. And most of the States——
The President. Wait, by the way, the gentlemen—you know everybody. You know Russell. You know—but this is Scott Atlas. Do you know that? Right?
Q. Yes.
The President. Scott is a very famous man—[laughter]—who's also very highly respected—Stanford. And he's working with us and will be working with us on the coronavirus. And he has many great ideas. And he thinks what we've done is really good, and now we'll take it to a new level. And so it's great to have Scott working along with us. And we appreciate it very much, Scott. Thank you very much, Scott. Thank you very much.
White House COVID-19 Pandemic Adviser Scott W. Atlas. Thank you very much.
The President. Really terrific.
Q. And to follow up——
The President. We've had some great discussions.
Unemployment Insurance Benefits/Cost-Sharing With States 
Q. To follow up on that, Mr. President, if you don't mind. You mentioned the States; have all the Governors signed on to this?
The President. We just had a meeting with the Governors, and they were very anxious to get money for the people in their States. And if they—depending on the State, we have the right to do what we want to do. We can terminate the 25 percent, or we don't have to do that. So we'll see what it is; it depends on the individual State.
But a lot of money will be going to a lot of people very quickly. And I've instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to move as quickly as he can.
Right?
Secretary Mnuchin. Yes.
The President. So we'll get it done.
Yes, please.
Shooting Outside of the White House 
Q. I have a question about coronavirus, but I wanted to just ask you to be clear on the incident outside. There's a fairly significant perimeter around the White House. So does it concern you at all that someone who is armed was able to get so close that you needed to be removed from the briefing room?
The President. Well, I don't know if he was close or not—he or she. I don't know if it was a he or a she. But I have such confidence in these people; they're so good. And I don't think the person breached anything. It was on the outside grounds. So I don't believe anything was breached. I asked that question. So they were relatively far away. School Reopening Efforts/Coronavirus Transmission Among Children/National Economy 
Q. And on coronavirus: 97,000 children tested positive for coronavirus in the last 2 weeks in July, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Does that give you any pause about schools reopening for——
The President. No.
Q. ——in-person learning?
The President. No, because they may have, as you would call it, ""a case."" It may be a case, but it's also a case where there's a tiny—it's a tiny fraction of death—a tiny fraction—and they get better very quickly.
Yes, they have—they may have it for a short period of time, but the—as you know, the seriousness of it, in terms of what it leads to, is extraordinarily small, very, very much less than 1 percent.
Q. So do you still believe that——
The President. Jonathan [Jonathan Lemire, Associated Press], go ahead.
Q. ——that children are essentially immune to the virus?
The President. Yes, I think that, for the most part, they do very well. I mean, they don't get very sick. They don't catch it easily. They don't get very sick. And, according to the people that I've spoken to, they don't transport it or transfer it to other people or certainly not very easily.
So yes, I think schools have to open. We want to get our economy going. We have incredible numbers despite this. If we could get this going—I think it's a very important thing for the economy to get the schools going.
Jonathan, go ahead.
2020 Democratic Presidential Candidate Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr./2020 Presidential Election/Polling Statistics 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. In Ohio, a few days ago, you said, quote, Joe Biden has ""hurt God""; ""he's against God."" The Vice President has said that he's a man of deep Catholic faith, and he has credited it for helping him endure some immense personal tragedy. So, sir, what did you mean by that, when you said that Joe Biden has ""hurt God"" or is ""against God""?
The President. Well, if you look at the manifesto that that they've come up with, and if you look at their stance on religion and things having to do, very importantly, with aspects of religion and faith: I don't think a man of deep religion would be agreeing to the Bernie Sanders plan. You take a look at what they have in, and you just—you can't put that into the realm of a religious group of people, I will say that.
A","nd I think it's one of the reasons why, if you look at polls, which—I'm not a big believer in polls. I wouldn't—if I was, I guess I wouldn't be standing here right now.
And by the way, our poll numbers are going up very rapidly, as you know, and Joe's are going down very rapidly. He'll have to come out of the basement, it looks like, pretty soon, because that—you know, it's one of those things.
But no, if you look at the manifesto—I call it the ""manifesto."" A lot of people are calling it a ""manifesto."" My opinion: It's further left than where Bernie was before. So normally, he'd be left, and you'd bring it somewhere a little bit toward the center. But some of the things that they have down there—and I'm not only talking in terms of religion; I'm not talking, even, in terms of religion—but some of the things they have in the agreement made—and this was an agreement made by Bernie Sanders and Joe—it's a terrible thing. It would be a terrible thing for our country.
It will destroy our country. We will go into a depression. We will put on regulation. We will double and triple taxes. We will—it will be terrible for health care. Just terrible. You'll have 180 million people lose their healthcare. It will be a terrible, terrible thing for our country.
Okay. Yes, please, Jeff [Jeff Mason, Reuters].
Health Insurance Reforms/Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
Q. Thank you, sir. I'd like to ask you a question about something you said in Bedminster as well. You said that you're planning to issue an Executive order to ensure that health insurance companies prevent—or cover people with preexisting——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——conditions. And you said that that had ""never been done before."" But that's not the case, because that is the law under the Affordable Care Act. So my question is: Why do you need to issue an Executive order for a law——
The President. Well, I said no——
Q. ——that is already existing?
The President. Yes. Yes, but, I didn't say—I said, as an Executive order. I—as you said, I said, as an Executive order, it hasn't been done before. We want to be able to assure people that preexisting condition is always taken care of.
As you know, we've done tremendous things having to do with the individual mandate. We got rid of the individual mandate from Obamacare, which really ended Obamacare, as it would be officially known, because the individual mandate was the biggest part. It was also the most unpopular part—where you pay for a terrible privilege of overpaying for insurance. You pay not to have to pay for your health care. And that was a disaster for people and a very unpopular—that was called the ""individual mandate,"" and we terminated that and—officially terminated that. And that was something that we have been given thanks for by many, many people.
But the individual mandate will always be with us. The individual mandate termination will always be—they can't start it up. In fact, I don't even believe—you'll have to tell me—I don't believe it's been challenged when we ended it.
And preexisting conditions, the Republicans are 100 percent there. And I'll be issuing, at some point in the not-too-distant future, a very strong statement on that, probably in the form of an Executive order.
Q. But why do you need, sir, to do an Executive order if it's already a part of existing law?
The President. Just a double safety net and just to let people know that the Republicans are totally, strongly in favor of preexisting condition—taking care of people with preexisting conditions.
It's a signal to people. It's a second platform. We have—preexisting conditions will be taken care of 100 percent by Republicans and the Republican Party. I think it's a very—I actually think it's a very important statement.
Yes, please.
Port Warehouse Explosion in Beirut, Lebanon/Group of Seven (G-7) Nations Summit
Q. Mr. President, do you still intend to try to hold an in-person G-7 meeting in the United States at some point in August and September? And have you already sent out invitations to do so?
The President. No, we haven't sent out invitations. We're talking to them. As you know, I was on the phone with many of them yesterday with respect to Lebanon, which is truly one of the saddest, most catastrophic things I've ever seen. And they have no idea how many people have died. They're having revolution right now in that country. It's just a terrible thing. And—but I was—yesterday, 8 o'clock in the morning, we had a—our time—we had a big teleconference call. Some of those people were there.
I'm much more inclined to do it sometime after the election. We were going to do it in September. They'd like to do it. We could do it through teleconference, or we could do it through a meeting. But I sort of am now suggesting—I told my people yesterday, actually, ""Why don't we do it sometime after the election when things are a little bit—you have a little bit more time to think about it,"" because that's very important.
Q. Have you decided to invite——
The President. The G-7 is very important.
Q. ——President Putin to that meeting?
The President. I don't know. But we have invited a number of people to the meeting. I certainly would invite him to the meeting; I think he's an important factor. But we will invite certain people that aren't in the G-7. Some people have already accepted.
But we're going to be doing it after the election. I think it's a better atmosphere to have a G-7. I think it's a lot—I think it's just a better, calmer atmosphere to have a G-7.
Yes, please.
Executive Action on Coronavirus Relief/Economic Stimulus Legislation 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask Secretary Mnuchin, actually: Have you spoken to any Democrats since Friday? Have they reached out to you at all about restarting negotiations?
Secretary Mnuchin. I've spoken to several Democrats. I have not spoken to Schumer and Pelosi since then.
Q. Do you expect to—would you reach out at all to them to—[inaudible]?
Secretary Mnuchin. I said any time they want to meet and they're willing to negotiate and have a new proposal, we're more than happy to meet.
The President. They're hurting people very badly. This would have been so easy for them to do. And I saw that Senator Schumer said today, on a show—I don't know what show—but he said today on a show that we should meet; we should do something. But you know, where's he been for—how many weeks have you been negotiating, like 4?
Secretary Mnuchin. Yes, sir.
The President. And they should do something; it would have been so much easier than doing it the way we did it. But we did something that's very important. And frankly, it's been well received—very well received.
Go ahead, please.
2020 Republican Presidential Acceptance Speech Location
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You tweeted earlier today that you're considering Gettysburg as a——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——venue for your speech for the RNC nomination acceptance. What's your thinking behind that as a possible location?
The President. Well, I think it's—I've been to Gettysburg numerous times. It's a national park; it's a national historic site. It's incredible. You know, it's the history. It's incredible, actually, to me. It was a very important place, and is a very important place in our country.
So we're looking at that, and we're looking at the White House. The White House would be very much easier for Secret Service. You see what just went on here. They're all here. Just like you have your seats; they have their seats at the White House. So there wouldn't be any expense or any extraordinary expense. And the White House would be a lovely place to do it, also.
Least expensive place that you could do it would be at the White House. This is a Government expense and I—you know, look, I watch—also with Government, I watch to make sure that we do what's right.
But we're looking at Gettysburg, and we're looking at the White House. And we have other sites too, but I think these would be two really beautiful sites.
Jennifer, please.
Q. Could we get an update on——
Q. But if it were here or there, would you envision having an audience for that speech?
The President. You could. You have plenty of room at both locations.
I see John Roberts. John, you were outside. You said you heard shots fired before?
Shooting Outside the White House 
Q. I heard two shots in rapid succession just after you took the podium.
The President. And they were shots pretty much?
Q. It certainly sounded like gunshots.
The President. And you definitely know the difference, I know that.
Q. I'm sorry?
The President. That's—you know the difference. I—you thought they were shots, John?
Q. It definitely sounded like gunfire.
The President. I saw your report inside when I went inside. It was a good report too. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Jennifer, please.
China-U.S. Relations/Coronavirus Outbreak in China/Global Coronavirus Pandemic 
Q. Thank you, sir. Can you give us an update on China? Do you think that your administration will respond to the sanctions that China announced this morning on American officials? The President. Well, we've already responded in many different ways. We're talking a lot about China. We shouldn't have been talking about China. We did a phase one deal, and it was a wonderful deal. And all of a sudden, it means very little in the overall import of things.
They should have never allowed what happened to the world, including us. But this was released into Europe, and it was released into the U.S., and it was released all throughout the world, but it wasn't released into China.
And we were doing numbers that will—you know, just were incredible. And we hope to be able to do them, perhaps, even next year. I think we're going have an incredible year next year. But that will never pay for the loss of life in our country and all over the world.
So we are—we view China differently than we did 8 months ago. Very much differently.
China-U.S. Trade/World Trade Organization/2020 Presidential Election/North Atlantic Treaty Organization/Russia/Germany/Federal Assistance to Farmers 
Q. Can I ask Secretary Mnuchin a question?
The President. Yes, please.
Q. Is there still any consideration of delisting Chinese companies? Is that an ongoing discussion?
Secretary Mnuchin. Delisting?
Q. Delisting Chinese companies.
Secretary Mnuchin. Well, we never comment on specific things, but no, there's nothing in particular on——
Q. Could it still be on the table?
Secretary Mnuchin. There's no—again, nothing specifically at the moment on—are you talking about delisting——
Q. For the U.S. stock exchange.
Secretary Mnuchin. Oh, companies on the exchange?
Q. Yes.
Secretary Mnuchin. Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, so just to be clear, we did make the recommendation and the SEC will be putting out—yes, as of the end of next year, if they do not fully comply—and that's Chinese companies, any other companies—they all have to comply with the same exact accounting or they will be delisted on the exchanges.
I thought you meant sanctions.
The President. But also——
Secretary Mnuchin. I was confused when you said ""delisting.""
The President. And, Jennifer, we're also talking, on the WTO—the World Trade Organization—China is treated much differently than we are. This should have been handled many years ago when it first happened, but they are treated as a nation that's developing. They're treated as what they call a ""developing nation,"" which gives them tremendous incentives and advantages over and above what the United States gets, and over and above what other countries get also. This is a developing nation? I don't think so. I don't think, for purposes of what we're talking about, it should be. And we are putting in—and we've already put in a request that China should no longer be declared a developing nation and have advantages over the U.S. And I told them that a year ago, and I told them that 2 years ago. And we put it in very powerfully that they should not have advantages over other countries, frankly, and assure—they're not going to have any more advantages over—this should have been done by numerous Presidents a long time ago, because it gives them a tremendous boost over everybody else, and it's a very unfair situation.
No, we are upset with China because of what they did. China was not good. And China will be—if you look at what's going to happen, whether it's Iran will make a deal with us in a month after the election is over if we win the election. But their greatest dream in the world is that Joe Biden wins, because they will own this country. China will own this country. North Korea will own this country. They will own our country.
And they're all waiting to see the election. And if we make a—if we have a win in—on November 3, we will have a deal with, in my opinion, Iran within 1 month. And I don't know that we want to have a deal with China, to be honest with you. So I'm saying to myself, ""Gee.""
But China wants us to lose very badly. And you know who else is not happy with us winning? Russia. The phony people that tell the story, the fake news stories about Russia—it was just reported, the numbers, I raised $400 billion extra in NATO. You know that. It went from $130 [billion]* to $400 billion—and that's a year—in order to strengthen up NATO. Nobody says that.
We became the biggest energy exporter. We are now—if you look at what we have, we're energy independent. So many different things. Our military is stronger than it ever was. We spent $2.5 trillion on our military.
I exposed the terrible deal between Germany and Russia on the pipeline. Nobody even knew about the pipeline: Nord Stream 2. Nobody knew about it. Nobody talks about it. I said, ""What's this all about?"" So we protect Germany from Russia, and Germany pays Russia billions of dollars a year for energy, and it's a big portion of Germany's energy. If I was a person that was a German citizen, I would not be happy with that deal, because they're at a very big disadvantage.
So no, Russia would not be happy. And I can tell you that China would not be happy at all.
And we've taken in tens of billions of dollars. There's your head of the Treasury—Steve, right? We've taken in tens of billions of dollars from China. We never took 10 cents from China, never—not even 10 cents. And $28 billion we gave to our farmers because they were targeted by China. They were actually targeted. And we gave $28 billion, compliments of China, to our great farmers and ranchers because they were unfairly targeted by China in order to make a better deal with us. I said: ""We're not going to do that. We're going to—instead of making a better deal, we're going to tariff you at very high numbers: 25 percent, 10 percent, and actually numbers that could go up a lot.""
And we had a lot of money left over. After giving the $28 billion to the farmers and ranchers and some others, frankly, we had many, many billions of dollars left over, and we're still receiving that money. Even though we made the deal, we're still receiving that money.
So if we win the election, we'll have deals with a lot of countries very fast. They're just waiting to see who wins, because they are hoping—they are hoping that Joe Biden wins. Sleepy Joe. And if he wins, you know what's going to happen? China will own us. Our markets will crash. The 401(k)s will go down to practically nothing. Stocks will go down to practically nothing. Remember, stocks, there's—these big companies, they're owned by millions of people that are carpenters and policemen and farmers and lots of other people. And they are the ones that benefit by having a good stock market, probably more than anybody else.
But the 401(k)s, the stocks, the economy will be in a shambles. They want to raise taxes. They want to triple taxes. They want to raise the corporate tax, but they want to raise all taxes. Ultimately, they can't pay for what they want to do anyway, and what they're going to do is destroy your health care and destroy so many other things.
We're going to have 180 million people that are so happy with their private health care; they're going to lose it under this crazy plan that these people are proposing.
So you will have a crash like you've never seen before. And I've been very good at predicting these things.
Yes, please, go ahead.
Potential Foreign Interference in the 2020 Presidential Election/Absentee Voting Policies/New York Democratic Primary Election 
Q. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. You just mentioned President Putin and the possibility of inviting him here because he's important. Your own Director of National Intelligence has said that Russia is currently planning—or actually meddling in the election. Have you raised that directly with Putin ever?
The President. Well, they—they said China, Russia, Iran, and probably others. But because of the fake news, they seem to think Russia plays the best, so——
Q. That's according to the DNI, not me.
The President. So what they do—it's all right. Well, I'm just saying, the way the politicians—look, the other day, they said—the three countries—they said China and Russia and Iran. And some reporter got up and said, ""Russia is meddling."" I said: ""Well, didn't it mention China and Iran? Why didn't you mention them too?""
Q. Because you were referring to Putin just now, sir.
The President. So I don't know. You know what I'm telling you? I'll tell you who's meddling in our elections: The Democrats are meddling by wanting and insisting on sending mail-in ballots that—where there's corruption all over the place.
If you check what happened in New York—a small—relatively small race with Carolyn Maloney. And they called her the winner the other day, because I was mentioning it at conferences and getting a lot of action on that statement.
So they called her; they declared her the winner. And they have no idea who won. And the person, her opponent, is very angry. But they had mail-in voting. And they had hundreds and, I think, even thousands of ballots that are missing, that were fraudulent.
Take a look at the Carolyn Maloney race. Take a look at Paterson, New Jersey. Take a look now at this one in Virginia, where they mailed out 500,000 applications, and they're going to people that aren't supposed to be getting an application.
Yes, please. Go ahead.
Restrictions on Foreign Travel to the U.S./Coronavirus Containment Efforts 
Q. Thank you, sir. Secretary Pompeo is heading to Europe again——
The President. Right—— Q. ——next week. Do you have any updates on when the travel restrictions to the EU are going to be lifted? It seems strange we're offering exemptions for professional athletes, but not to K-1 visa holders, the so-called, you know, ""fiancé""——
The President. Well, we're trying to do the best we can. You have big sporting events, and that's good for our economy; that's good for us. And they do talk about certain exemptions, and they make sure everyone is perfectly tested and everyone comes in at a hundred percent.
But you know, we do make certain accommodations, because you do have star athletes, and that means a good thing for the country. That's economic development, et cetera. But we are working very closely with Europe and with other countries to see what's the best timing.
Don't forget, I was the one that turned Europe off because they really—they lead the way. They led it much more so than we did. We were months following them. And—in terms of, they got hit earlier than we did. Quite a bit earlier than we did.
So I put the restrictions on Europe. I put the restrictions on China, which was a great thing to do, in retrospect. We're getting—I mean, that's—that was a very important day. Dr. Fauci said that was one of the most important days. And a lot of people didn't want me to do it, but we first put a ban on anybody from China coming in, and then we put a ban on Europe coming in.
But we're working very closely with Europe to see when that will all come off.
Yes, please.
Coronavirus Mortality Rates/Federal Coronavirus Response 
Q. [Inaudible]—if 160,000 people had died on President Obama's watch, do you think you would have called for his resignation?
The President. No, I wouldn't have done that. I think it's been amazing what we've been able to do. If we didn't close up our country, we would have had 1½ or 2 million people already dead. We've called it right; now we don't have to close it. We understand the disease.
Nobody understood it because nobody has ever seen anything like this. The closest thing is, in 1917, they say, right? The great pandemic certainly was a terrible thing, where they lost, anywhere from 50 to 100 million people. Probably ended the Second World War; all the soldiers were sick. That was a terrible situation. And this is highly contagious. This one is highly, highly contagious.
No, if I would have listened to a lot of people, we would have kept it open. And by the way, we keep it open now, all the way. We keep it open. But we would have kept it open, and you could be up to a million and a half or 2 million people right now—1½ to 2 million people.
Our people have done a fantastic job, our consultants and our doctors. You know, and with disagreements and with a lot of things happening. What we've done with ventilators has been amazing. What we've done with medical equipment has been incredible. We've supplied the Governors. Nobody, not one person in this country that needed a ventilator didn't get it. And you know, at the beginning, there was a big shortage of ventilators. Nobody had stockpiles or anything comparable to what you had to have.
So we would have lost—if you think about it, you had mentioned 160,000 people. Multiply that times 10 right now. I think it would have been unsustainable and unacceptable. But that's what would have happened had we kept it open.
So no, I think we're a very large country. We are—one person—and I say it all the time; a lot of people like to leave that out—one person is too many. It should have never happened. But they've done a—really, an extraordinary job. They'll never be given the credit—and I'm not talking about me. The people that have worked on this so hard will never be given the credit, but they've done an extraordinary job with a very large, diverse country. Really, an extraordinary job.
And a lot of the Governors who, as you know, they sort of do the micro in their States, and they go up, and I think I can tell you that a lot of the Governors have done an extraordinary job too.
Yes, please go ahead.
Brazil-U.S. Relations/The President's Use of Tariffs 
Q. Mr. President, thank you. Did you ask the U.S. Ambassador in Brazil to focus his efforts in eliminating ethanol tariffs in Brazil?
The President. You have to—you can't—yes.
Q. Did you ask the Ambassador in Brazil to focus his efforts to lower, to eliminate ethanol tariffs in Brazil?
The President. We haven't really discussed that too much, but at some point, we probably will be. And we don't want people tariffing us. And if they tariff us—although, I must tell you, I have a very good relationship with President Bolsonaro. He's great. He's—and I hear he's doing well. He's recovered from having COVID. ""Having COVID-19,"" as they say. And that's great. And send him my regards.
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. I think that, as far as Brazil is concerned, if they do tariffs, we have to have an equalization of tariffs. And we are going to be presenting something having to do with tariffs and fairness in tariffs, because we have many countries, for many years, that have been charging us tariffs to do business, and we don't charge them. And it's called ""reciprocity."" It's called ""reciprocal tariffs."" And you may be seeing something on that very soon.
Did you have one, OAN?
Investigation Into Russia's Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election 
Q. [Inaudible]—Brazil on coronavirus, Mr. President.
The President. OAN, please.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, thank you for coming back to finish the briefing——
The President. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Q. ——after the scuffle. So I have an opinion question for you.
The President. Okay.
Q. Joe Biden is set to announce his running mate. At any time now, we expect him to announce her.
Many of your supporters feel that the reason that Obama's former NSA, Susan Rice, is at the top of Biden's list is that she can best cover up a lot of the Obamagate surveillance crimes that have taken place during your campaign.
What are your thoughts? What is your opinion? Do you subscribe to that line of thought? And how do you feel about it? The President. Well, look, the Obama campaign spied on our campaign. And they've been caught, all right? And now let's see what happens to them. But they have been caught. They've been caught red-handed. It's probably treason. It's a horrible thing they did. It probably never happened before; at least, nobody got caught doing it.
But they used the intelligence agencies of our country to spy on my campaign, and they have been caught. And there are a lot of people involved. I don't want to say how much she's involved. Frankly, if he chooses her, that's fine. But that's a potential liability. We'll see.
But President Obama knew about it. Joe Biden knew about it. Comey—[laughter]—knew about it. Brennan, Clapper, the whole group, they all knew about it. Lisa Page and her lover Strzok, they all knew about it.
And we have it documented. We have it in texts. We have it in all sorts of forms. They knew about it. It was a terrible thing. It should have never happened and should never be allowed to happen again to a President. This should never happen again.
This was a setup like we've never seen. I think it's the political crime of the century, and they've been caught. So let's see what happens to them all.
Thank you very much. Thank you."
"August 12, 2020",The President's News Conference,Donald J. Trump,"Donald J. Trump, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/343283",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1251,"The President. Thank you very much. I appreciate you being here, and good evening. As we continue to confront the China virus, we're rebuilding America's economy like nobody thought possible, actually. We're doing incredibly well.
The stock market is up almost 300 points again today. While our economy is performing significantly better than Europe—which people have to understand—very strongly; it's performing better than any market anywhere in the world actually. At the same time, Europe has experienced a 40-percent higher excess mortality than the United States. And I will say that that's a significant number. We're working with Europe on their difficulties, and we are going to help them all the way.
We're doing very well, as you know, on the vaccines and the therapeutics. But think of that: We have the strongest economy—performing economy in the world. We're up—I think it's $9 trillion since March—$9 trillion in value. That's a number that nobody has ever heard of before. We're also getting close to about a 50-percent number since March, which is incredible. So it's $9 trillion. It's almost 50 percent. In fact, I think it went above 50 percent today with the 300-point increase. And it's—so we're doing much better than Europe, significantly. And at the same time, Europe has experienced a 40-percent higher excess mortality than the United States.
I just want to mention because another number of judges were approved recently. We'll be, probably, over 300 judges—Federal judges, including Court of Appeals judges—approved by the end of my first term. And other than they—when they added new judges into somebody's term, which happens seldom, but we have more than any—this is a record. Nobody has ever seen anything like this in one term. So we're going to have over 300 Federal judges, and that's Court of Appeals judges, and that's just in the first term. It's—probably, we'll finish out over 300, which is pretty amazing.
The stock market's rebound signals a ""V""-shaped recovery, stronger than our competitors anywhere in the world—stronger.
[At this point, the President indicated the chart displayed on a screen.]
If you look, you'll see exactly what we have. We lead the world. Japan is second. But in terms of dollar value, it's not even close. So there it is. A lot of great competitors: Europe, United Kingdom, Japan, China, Hong Kong. The United States is leading the world, very substantially.
On the second slide, you'll see the virus-induced economic contraction in the United States has been far less severe than it was with our peers and peer nations. And you see that, right there; there's the United States. And that's despite the fact that we've done more testing than any other nation in the world, that we've done more, by far, ventilators. We're building thousands and thousands of ventilators a month, and we're distributing them all over the world. We're helping other countries.
But despite all of these factors, the shallowest contraction, which is a big deal. I'm sure you'd love to put them in your various media outlets. I know you want to get that out. If you want to leave the room early and do that, that would be fine. The rapid recovery—but it would be nice to report it.
The rapid recovery of homebuilders' sentiment points to massive new construction. And we are doing massive amounts of construction of new homes, and that's because people have tremendous confidence. This is where we went, and the housing market has quickly rebounded. We were at a record, and now we're going to be at a record again very shortly. Those numbers are incredible. That's where we are. And we had to turn off the economy, and now we're turning it back on, and that's beyond a ""V"" shape. This is going to be very strong; it's called a ""strong 'V.'""
Automobile demand has increased 65 percent over the last 3 months—65 percent, automobile demand. And we're anticipating that that's going to go up even further, but that's more than any—anybody else. The manufacturing sector—remember, ""manufacturing is dead,"" according to the past administration of Obama and Biden. ""Manufacturing is dead. You'd need a magic wand."" Well, you don't need a magic wand. You need competence and capability. The manufacturing sector is booming, and the Production Index is at the highest reading since October of '18, which is—was a—an extraordinary period of time.
[The President indicated another chart on a screen.]
And there we are. That's pretty good. These are numbers that nobody has seen until just recently, and now they're just coming out. These are numbers that are leading—I guess, the stock market people, they're very smart people. I know many of them, and they're seeing things that they don't even believe. So the manufacturing sector is booming, and the Production Index is at its highest reading in a long, long time.
The economy generated over 9 million jobs in the last 3 years—a record, by far—and 12 million more jobs than experts predicted. So there you are. You look at that, and that's a record, and it's a record for the quarter. We had over 9 million, substantially more than 9 million jobs.
So those are incredible numbers about our economy and how it's coming back. It's coming back very strongly, and it's coming back at a level that's far greater than anybody anticipated. And we're very proud of that. And I give a lot of credit to all of our people—Steve and Larry.
And we'll be talking about it. If you have any questions on it—shouldn't have any questions. I didn't print those charts. Who did? The economy generated—let's see. I don't know. We'll find that out for you, but it wasn't us. We took those—we took those numbers from somebody. Where did you get those numbers, Larry? They're from where?
National Economic Council Director Lawrence A. Kudlow. It's from the BLS jobs report——
The President. BLS jobs report.
Director Kudlow. The monthly jobs report, through July.
The President. Okay. Everybody has that—everybody who needs?
The Democrats have abandoned the American people over the simple subject of politics. Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are holding the American people hostage over money for their radical leftwing agenda that the country doesn't want and won't accept.
For example, they've asked for a ridiculous $3.5 billion—that's billion—$3.5 billion for universal mail-in voting, a system riddled by fraud and corruption. You just look at what happened with the Carolyn Maloney race. They should do that race over, by the way. I think her opponent is right when he is having fits about that race. When you look at the ballot, the ballots that are missing, and the ballot frauds—nobody knows what's going on with that race, and yet they declared her a winner. So her opponent—I don't know what's happened over the last 24 hours, but her opponent is rightfully going a little bit crazy.
And then, you look at what happened in Virginia, where they have 500,000 applications sent out at random to people that have no idea what happened. And they admitted they made a mistake. And many were sent to dead people, and many were sent to—a number was sent—I guess, two—that at least two, three, four were sent to dogs. One was sent to a cat. [Laughter] They're sent all over the place. That was in Virginia.
In Paterson, New Jersey, they had a massive amount of voter fraud. And it's been a disaster. Paterson, New Jersey has been total disaster; that's universal mail-in voting.
So they want $3.5 billion for universal mail-in voting for the country, where you have hundreds of millions of voters. They can't do a little race with 20,000 people; now they want to take it countrywide. Mail-in voting—it's going to be the greatest fraud in the history of elections. When you always talk about ""Russia, Russia, Russia,"" China, Iran on voting—your biggest problem is going to be with the Democrats, not with China, Russia, and Iran. Your biggest problem is going to be with the Democrats.
But now the Democrats—they want $3.5 billion, think of it. But now that they're unwilling to approve a bill that gives all of that money—of course, we would never approve an amount like that. And they also want $25 billion additional for the Post Office, Steve. Twenty-five billion for the Post Office so the Post Office can handle this vast amount of ballots that are being sent, at random, all over the place. They have no idea where they're going.
So they want $25 billion, and they want—think of this: They want $3.5 billion. Would you say that's enough to cover it? I think we could do it for less, right? I think we could do it for less. But they want $25 billion for the Post Office because of this.
And remember, the new man—who is a great person, a great businessman—he just got there a little while ago. The Post Office has been run poorly for many, many decades. Great people in the Post Office, incredible people, but they've had very bad leadership for many years. So we'll get it straightened out.
But they turned down this bill, because they want radical-left agenda items that nobody in their right mind would approve. So they want $25 billion for the Post Office. They want $2.5 or $3.5 billion for universal mail-in—$3.5 billion. And the bill is not going to happen because they don't even want to talk about it, because we can't give them the kind of ridiculous things that they want that have nothing to do with the China virus. It has nothing at all to do with China virus, much of what they're asking for. So therefore, they don't have the money to do the universal mail-in voting. So therefore, they can't do it, I guess. Right?
Are they going to do it even though they don't have the money? They're asking for the $3.5 billion. They're asking for $25 billion for the Post Office so they can do this, I guess, and other things. At $25 [billion],* I would hope it would be a lot of other things too.
But therefore, they don't have it. They don't have the money to do the universal mail-in votes. It will be the greatest rigged election in history. It will be the greatest fraud ever perpetrated, other than perhaps what they did to my campaign, where they spied on my campaign: President Obama, Biden, and everybody else. And they got caught. Let's see what happens. This will be one of the greatest frauds in history.
So they're admitting that they want $3.5 billion, and they're not going to do a deal that's good for the American people. Therefore, they're not going to get the $3.5 billion. Therefore, they can't do the universal mail-in vote. It's very simple. How are they going to do it if they don't have the money to do it?
The Democrats are also holding up money for schools and hospitals and small businesses and State and local governments. They tried to stop Americans from getting unemployment insurance and protection from evictions, which is why I took this decisive action. And I did Executive orders, which are now in full force in effect, and they're going forward.
I signed a directive to provide a total of $400 of additional support for Americans who are unemployed due to the China virus. That's $400 more than the Democrats have provided. Remember that: That's $400 more than the Democrats have provided.
Nancy and Chuck haven't provided anything. And remember this: President Obama, when we had a problem—a pretty big problem, a very big problem—you know what he gave? Twenty-five dollars. He gave 25 bucks. So now they say, ""Well, we want to give $500 or we want to give $600."" They don't want to give. They don't even give anything. They're not doing anything.
But President Obama and Biden—Sleepy Joe—gave $25. Twenty-five. And they'll complain, ""Oh, we want to give more."" Well, we're giving $400, and that's now in the works, and that will be getting out to the people soon, Steve. Okay? Remember that: $25 is what they gave the last time. Twenty-five.
I want to make it unmistakably clear that I'm protecting people from evictions. They didn't want to do that. The Democrats didn't want to do a protection from evictions—people getting evicted because of the coronavirus or the ""China virus,"" whatever you want to call it. We have 20—now we're up to 21 different names. All we know is it came out of China, and it shouldn't have. They should have stopped it.
Under my Executive order, HUD, HHS, and CDC have been directed to ensure renters and homeowners that they can stay safely in their homes. They're not going to be evicted. They are not going to be evicted. And those letters have already been sent out, Steve, so you'll make sure of that.
I'm providing a payroll tax holiday to all Americans earning less than $100,000 per year, meaning bigger paychecks for working families through the end of 2020. That's a tremendous amount of money that's being supplied and given to families. Tremendous.
The Democrats didn't want to do a payroll tax. They thought it was ""too much money,"" I guess, or it would make businesses too successful. They don't want to see success. They certainly don't want to see it before the election. They certainly don't want to see the kind of graphs and charts that you saw up there. They don't. Because they say they can't win. With that kind of success, they can't win. They have to get used to it.
Remember: We've already gotten $3 trillion in stimulus, so they should have probably negotiated a little bit differently. Maybe they should have asked for all of this before they got most of the money and we gave it out, a lot of it to the people.
When we win the election—when I win the election, I'm going to completely and totally forgive all deferred payroll taxes without in any way, shape, or form hurting Social Security. That money is going to come from the general fund. We're not going to touch Social Security. I said from day one that we were going to protect Social Security, and we're going to protect our people. And Social Security is one of the things that will be protected. Preexisting conditions will be protected. Medicare will be protected.
But Social Security will be totally protected under me. Under them, it will not be protected, because we will have a stock market crash the likes of which you've never seen. Your taxes will be doubled and tripled. And your regulations will go through the roof, which is what was causing the problems with the country in the first place.
Student loans: I signed a directive providing relief to student borrowers. Not their fault that they can't go to college. I will be deferring payments on student loans at zero interest until further notice. So we're going to take care of our students. We've got a lot of great students out there, and they got hit like everybody else. So I will be deferring payments on student loans at zero interest until further notice.
And on the payroll tax, we'll be terminating the payroll tax after I, hopefully, get elected. We'll be terminating the payroll tax, so that will mean anywhere from $5,000 to even more per family, and also great for businesses and great for jobs. A lot of people will be very happy to hear that. A lot of the great—certainly, conservative economists will be great to have—they think that's the greatest thing we can do. That's better than the payments; that's better than anything else.
But it's a lot of money, and it's going right directly to the people, and it goes there very easily. But it also creates stronger companies to employ the people. So we will be—on the assumption I win, we are going to be terminating the payroll tax after the beginning of the new year.
Today I met with parents, students, teachers, and health experts to discuss the vital importance of safety and safely reopening America's schools. This evening I'll outline the commonsense recommendations that should guide schools as they reopen with precautions. We want to be very, very safe and very careful—so precautions in place.
Our strategy to safely reopen schools mirrors our approach nationwide as we race toward the competition—and the completion—we're competing with others, but I'm not completing—competing with anyone. We just want to have a vaccine. We have—we're dealing with other countries, and we want them to do well. We're giving them whatever information they need. We're all working towards something that will happen. It will happen before the end of the year, maybe substantially before, but before the end of the year. And therapeutics will happen, likewise, even sooner.
But we're looking for that responsible path forward to shelter those at highest risk, while allowing those at lower risk to resume work and school and play football. Go play football.
I spoke to some of the great football players—college players—Trevor and a lot of great players called, coach called, Coach O. A lot of fantastic people I got to speak to—athletes, leaders. They want to play football. Let them play. Let them play. And they'll—they feel safer in the field than they do walking around and doing nothing.
So, hopefully, that will happen. And hopefully, when they play football, they will proudly stand for the national anthem, and they will proudly stand and respect the American flag—or at least I'm not watching. I can't speak for others, but based on what I see now and based on what I'm looking at, with respect to the NBA at this point, a lot of people agree with me. So we want people—we would like to request people—you stand proudly for the flag and for the national anthem.
In the months since the virus arrived, we've learned a great deal. While this is a dangerous and highly infectious disease, it primarily affects the oldest segment of our population or those with chronic health issues.
The United States has the largest nursing home and assisted-living home population in the Western world, by far. Nearly half of all of the deaths from the China virus in the United States have occurred in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.
The median age of those who succumb to the virus is 78 years old. These findings underscore that all Americans must continue to apply extreme vigilance in protecting our elderly population and those with chronic conditions. Outcomes are very different for younger Americans without serious health issues—tremendously different. They can often expect mild or moderate symptoms or even no symptoms whatsoever. They have very strong immune systems, we've learned, even more so than we ever thought.
In a typical year, approximately five times as many Americans under the age of 65 die from heart disease as have so far been lost to the coronavirus from the same age group. That's an interesting statistic. Blessedly, children appear to face the lowest risk of all. It's 99.995 percent of all fatalities are adults. Think of that: 99.95. That is extremely close to 100 percent of all fatalities are adults.
Children often have only mild symptoms, and medical complications are incredibly rare—very, very, very rare. Those that do face complications often have underlying medical conditions. In each of the last 5 years, the flu resulted in more deaths of those under 18 in the United States than have been lost thus far to coronavirus, by far. The flu does kill young people.
Given these considerations, we believe many school districts can now reopen safely, provided they implement mitigation measures and health protocols to protect families, protect teachers, and protect students. All families should be empowered to make the decision that is right for their own circumstances. This is especially important if a child has underlying health conditions or lives with a parent or grandparent who is at a high risk.
And one of the things we'd like to do is when we make payment to schools—because we spend a lot of money on schools—we'd like to make the payment directly to the student or to the child. And that would be to the parents, essentially, but to the child. We want to follow the child so that if a school is closed, the family can go to another school, maybe in another area, but they can do it. And we'd like to make that payment—rather than paying a school that's closed, we'd rather pay directly. We're following the child—where the child goes. And we want to pay the family, pay the child, and then the family can take care of the cost.
And we're trying to get that approved too, but the Democrats don't like doing anything, unless it means doing for the union, which controls Nancy and controls Chuck 100 percent. And I have nothing wrong with the union. I have great respect, more than—very few people do I respect more than a great teacher. That's a tremendous talent. They're really underappreciated. These are phenomenal people with tremendous talent; the great ones are among the most important people we have in this country.
But—and they'll be great at other—they'll be great at charter schools. And they'll be great at—well, we talk about school choice, which we'd like to see so that parents can take their children to the school of their choice. That's something we want. We think it's very important, especially in the minority communities. They want it so badly. African American, Hispanic American, Asian American—they want it so badly.
But the two people I mentioned, Nancy and Chuck, they're totally controlled by the heads of the union. I think the teachers like us a lot. We're taking care of our teachers. We want to take care of our teachers.
But we cannot indefinitely stop 50 million American children from going to school and harming their mental, physical, emotional, and academic development, and inflicting long-term, lasting damage.
I heard a gentleman today, a great person—some of you were at that meeting—from Harvard, say that every year is $10,000. It's a—people—they lose a tremendous amount of money in the future. He mentioned $10,000. And I think he was talking about on a yearly basis. They lose a lot by every year of education that they lost. Every year they gain, they gain $10,000. And when you have students sitting at home, playing with a computer, it's not the same. That's one thing we've learned for sure: It's not the same. It can never be the same as being in a classroom. So we want to get our students in the classroom.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has released guidance recommendation that schools reopen. They said, ""Reopen."" It said, quote, ""Lengthy time away from school and associated interruption of supportive services often results in social isolation, making it difficult for schools to identify and address important learning deficits."" The doctors, also warned about the risk of increased abuse, substance use, depression, and suicide. Suicide.
The National Education Association recently stated, ""Despite the momentous efforts of educators during the pandemic, online learning has never been an effective replacement for in-person learning and support."" So when you sit at home in a basement, looking at a computer, your brain starts to wither away. We have a lot of good experience at that, just by taking a look at what's happening in politics.
Studies estimate that school closures last spring caused the average student to fall 50-percent behind in math and roughly 35 percent in reading compared to a typical year. Think of that: It caused the average student to fall 50-percent behind in math and 35 percent in reading, compared to being at the school, being with your teachers, being in a classroom. We've learned that. We've learned that learning from a laptop is not great.
And frankly, we've also learned that telehealth—a little unrelated, but it's up 35,000 percent, and it's been incredible—35,000 percent. We'll check that number, Larry, but that's an incredible—but it is. People staying home, and the telehealth—that has been a tremendous success.
We've learned those two things during this period of time with the plague coming in. And those are two things we know.
School closures harm low-income students the most because they have less access to high-quality remote learning—they don't have computers—and less resources for academic support.
All schools should be making plans to resume in-person classes as soon as possible. To support the reopening of America's schools, we provided $13 billion in elementary and secondary schools toward the CARES Act and CARES Act funding—we're giving CARES Act funding—the vast majority of which remain available for States to use. So a tremendous amount of money: $13 billion. That's the CARES Act funding, and we're giving a large portion of that for States to use.
Today I'm pleased to announce that we will provide up to 125 million reusable masks to various school districts all around the country. My administration also stands ready to deploy CDC teams to support schools that are opening and schools that need help in safety and in order to safely reopen.
Finally, today my administration is highlighting general recommendations for all schools and guidance to protect high-risk teachers and students. We're working very, very closely with many of the schools and school districts throughout the country.
And they include the following: to ensure all students, teachers, and staff understand the symptoms of the China virus; require all students, teachers, and staff to self-assess their health every morning before coming to school; encourage frequent hand washing or hand sanitizing during the school day, beginning upon entrance to school, and ensuring that hand-washing facilities are widely available throughout the school. And, for the most part, schools have been very good at that.
Minimize large indoor gatherings. Hold large gatherings outdoors whenever possible; maintain high standards of hygiene and ventilation within the classrooms, including keeping windows and doors open whenever possible, and running fans and air conditioning units whenever possible; require students, teachers, and staff to socially distance around high-risk individuals and socially distance whenever possible in any event; encourage the use of masks when social distancing is not possible; post instructions regarding hygiene and social distancing all over the school and all around the school.
We encourage schools to adopt these measures. We've been working with so many of them. And, to the best of my knowledge, virtually every one of them agrees to do that.
While we're also providing high-risk teachers and students options to engage in distance teaching or learning, we're working on that also. College-age students also continue to be one of the lowest risk demographics. More than 99.8 percent of the deaths from this horrible disease—""the invisible enemy,"" we call it—occur in people over 24 years of age. Think of that: 99.8 percent occur in people over 24 years of age.
For this reason, it could be safer for them to live at a school rather than live with their older parents or grandparents. They've got to go to school. We've got to open up. We've got to open up our schools and open up our businesses. And a lot of it has been open, but we can do better.
As we move forward, the number of cases is not, by any means, the most important metric to focus on because the fact is, we have more cases because we have far more testing than any country in the world. There's no country that's even close.
We've done more testing and better testing than any country. And many of these countries that the media was putting up as a shining example of success, they're, right now, in massive outbreaks. You see what's going on in many of the countries that you constantly mention.
Far more important is who the virus is infecting. That's why our strategy and attention are focused on preventing the cases that are most likely to require hospitalization or result in death—those that afflict the elderly and those with certain underlying health conditions, all the while acting to prevent hospital overcrowding.
If you look at some of the States that had a flare-up recently, they're all doing very well. Florida is going down rapidly. I want to give a lot of credit to the Governors. Florida is going down, and Arizona is going down, way down. They've done a fantastic job. California, as you know, is going down. And many other locations—it's doing very well. And many locations are really in fantastic shape—some with very little, if any, problem—large portions of the United States.
Those advocating for a never-ending, blanket, nationwide lockdown have no answer for what it would do to the mental, physical, and social health of millions of American children and people. This includes parents, where they have to stay home with their children because—and they lose their work, and they lose their job because their children isn't at school. They have to have somebody to take care of it, and they want to take care of their child. They don't trust people. A society must put the health and safety of our children first.
A man who has the respect of everybody—he's highly respected by me and anybody on this subject; he's the expert—Dr. Scott Atlas is here from Stanford, and he's been working with us for a period of time. And I thought it would be great—he was saying things to me the other day. I said it would be great if you could tell that to the media.
So this is the first time I've shared the platform. And it's an honor to do so. Scott is truly—he's a brilliant man. He's a wonderful man. And he cares about the subject very much. And I'd like to ask Scott to come up please and say a few words.
Thank you, Scott. White House COVID-19 Pandemic Adviser Scott W. Atlas. Thank you, Mr. President. It's obviously a great honor to be here and a great honor to serve this President, who's really focused on the very important parts of the pandemic.
And I'm new here. I'm just, sort of, getting involved, but I want to thank you and the Vice President and the entire team, the Task Force team, and all the people who are not very visible, really, for working so hard. These people are working 24/7, and it's quite amazing.
And I think the—today we had a fantast","ic event, that I'll just mention, on opening the schools, because the President's priority is to open the schools and open them safely and have parents have the options to either use open schools or do whatever they can to eventually get back to open schools, including any kind of hybrid or other arrangement they may want to do.
It was a great event. We had a group of fantastic parents, teachers, medical experts, and it went very well. And so I won't spend a lot of time up here, but thank you very much, and I hope I can help out in some way. Thank you.
The President. Steve [Steve A. Holland, Reuters]. Thank you.
Executive Action on Coronavirus Relief/Payroll Tax Cut 
Q. You mentioned the Executive orders that you signed. Are we now unlikely to see any more stimulus legislation before the election?
The President. Well, we're giving $400. And we are in constant touch with Governors, also, who—they'll be making, perhaps, a contribution. They have options. They can do it, or they don't have to do it. I think most of them will do it.
We're also doing a payroll tax cut, which is a massive number. That's a very big number. And that's a number that's bigger than the—any of the numbers we talked about. And the beauty of that is that it really incentivizes companies, and—because it's both a company cut and a employee cut. So that much, really—very much incentivizes people to go back to work and work hard and the company to hire people back. And we've had some of the great economic minds saying that's the most important cut; that would be the best cut you could do.
We couldn't get the Democrats to even think about agreeing to it. It's not the Democrat way, I guess. Because it just seems that, whether it's Larry Kudlow, or any of your many friends, that's the one they wanted the most. Would you say, Larry?
Director Kudlow. Yes, sir.
The President. And so we're doing that. And that was never even really discussed, because that was taken off the table by the Democrats immediately.
And this is every week. Every week, you get a check—or a month, or biweekly. This is a major amount of money that you're getting directly. So it's really—you know, it's a very big number. It's very substantial number. And this is—don't forget, this is in addition to the $400. And this is a big number.
And now, at the end of the year, on the assumption that I win, I'm going to terminate the payroll tax, which is another thing that some of the great economists would like to see done. We'll be paying into Social Security through the general fund. And it works out very nicely.
If Biden would win, he wouldn't do that, because he's going to double and triple everybody's taxes. He's going to have to explain that one. And as you know, he's also going to quadruple regulations. He wants to put regulations on.
One of the reasons that we had the kind of numbers and big bounces that you've seen—I mean we closed it up. We saved millions of lives, and now we opened it, and we bounce right back where we were. It looks like we'll be bouncing right back where we were. But one of the reasons is because we cut so many horrible regulations.
And Biden, with his new partner, Kamala, will—if you think—he's going to put it all back, but many times more. I mean, they want to increase regulations, and that's just going to drive companies out, and it's going to drive people out. It's going to drive them to other countries, and it's going to make us not competitive with other countries.
Please, OAN.
Antifa Movement/Civil Unrest and Violence in U.S. Cities 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to highlight a kind of odd situation. In the last hour or so, if you Googled ""antifa.com,"" it would take you straight to Joe Biden's website, his official campaign website. Odd situation. We don't know who's behind that.
But it raises an interesting leadership question: Should Joe Biden, the Democrat Party, Kamala Harris—should they publicly denounce the Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization?
The President. They should. I think they're afraid to. It's—in my book, it's virtually a part of their campaign: Antifa. The Democrats act like, ""Gee, I don't know exactly what that is."" Take a look at Portland. Take a look at any place you want to take a look at, and they're all over the place. They were here. We put on a 10-year prison sentence if you knocked down any statues, 2 months ago. And since then, we haven't seen much of them.
We had to send border security—and we sent actually Homeland and Border and different forms of Homeland to Portland, in order to—you know what we had to do. We had to save—they wanted to knock down a courthouse—a $500 million courthouse—they wanted to burn it down, knock it down. And they were easily able to defend. But the mayor and the Governor of the State, they didn't want to do that.
And we actually sent our people there, and they did a great job. And they were—they did it easily. But in the meantime, they went to other parts of the city, and they're doing damage. And we're recommending to the Governor that they call in national security, call in the National Guard. We're willing to get—we would stop that problem in one hour.
We sent just defensive measures to protect and save that courthouse from being burned down or knocked down. We also saved a couple of other buildings—Federal buildings—because they were unable to do the job.
I have to say this: They have really good police. They have a great group of people that, if they would be allowed to do their job—same with Chicago and same with New York and a couple of other cities—if they allowed—you have, in Chicago, 25,000 police, and they're really good, but they're not allowed to do their job.
In New York, you have New York's Finest, but they've totally taken away their incentive. They've taken away their lives, in a sense, because they don't allow them to do their job. They could do that job so easily; you wouldn't have a problem in New York. And that includes with terrorism and everything else. They disbanded—they've cut by $1 billion their budget in New York. One billion dollars. And crime is up by 200 percent, 250 percent, depends on what week you're looking at. It's crazy what's going on in New York.
We could solve that problem easily, but we don't have to, because they should be able to do it themselves. But they have to give the honor back. It's the—it's an honor. They have to give the honor back to their law enforcement groups. New York is great; so is Chicago. And in Portland, they could do the job. If they don't want to do that, we would send in—gladly, if they want—the National Guard will take care of it in 1 hour. It will go very quickly.
Q. Mr. President, if I could——
The President. As we did—by the way, if you take a look in Minneapolis, when they were burning down Minneapolis—a wonderful place but nobody's ever seen anything like it. After days, the very liberal mayor—and these are all run by liberal Democrats. Every place I talk about is run—because we have great cities, and they're run by Republicans. Okay? It's—you know, it's—there's no magic to it. It's obvious, what's going on.
And these—the cities that I mentioned are all run by liberal—very liberal—Democrats. And it's very sad when you see what's happening to New York. It's very sad when you see what's happening to other cities, not just those three, other cities. And when you look at what's happening, it's not even believable.
I left New York almost 4 years ago. And you could see signs of problems, because de Blasio was there. He's a horrific mayor, just horrific. I mean, people don't want to go there anymore. He's—not only is it bad with crime, I mean, the way he talks about the city and what he does. He's horrific. And when I see that, it's a very sad thing. I left almost 4 years ago, right? And when I look and see what's happening to a city that I love—that still has great potential, but it's going to have to be brought back. Because what happened in New York is—it's not even believable.
What's happening in Chicago, where one weekend you have 78 people shot and 18 die—in a weekend. And then, successive weekends, you have so much of that happening. And it's not even—it's really not even believable.
Q. Sir——
The President. And if you let Democrats run this country—and we've stopped it from going other places—if you let Democrats run this country, you'll have all of your cities be just like that.
Q. Mr. President——
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Yes, please.
Federal Coronavirus Response/National Economy 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. The heads of the Boston and Dallas Fed, today, said that the economy hasn't recovered strong enough because the country hasn't contained the virus. So what's your response to them? And wouldn't that argue for a stronger Federal response?
The President. Well, look, you just saw it. Other countries—we're doing much better than all other major countries, peer countries. This chart came out just a little while ago. I thought I'd say—see, it's that kind of a question—a wise-guy question—because I just went over the whole thing. We're doing better than almost everyone with the economy. And I think we're—you know, we face a headwind because Democrats, perhaps for political reasons, don't want to open up their States. And that's having a huge toll—that's taking a huge toll on people within those States.
When you look at North Carolina, you have—a man doesn't want to open it up. You have—you look at Michigan, you look at some States—I mean, they just want to keep these people in their houses, in their prisons. They call them ""prisons."" And I think a lot of it is for political reasons, because they want to look as bad as possible on November 3. But I don't think it's going to matter because we're doing so well in so many ways.
As far as the plague is concerned, when you look at the numbers, take a look at what's going on now with other countries, they're having flare-ups that are very, very substantial, and we've done very well. We're helping a lot of those countries. And those were model countries that you used to talk about and say how well they were doing, except they just exploded. They just had very big flare-ups. You understand that. No, we're doing very well. And I don't have to show you the charts again, but those charts are at a level that nobody even thought possible.
I think we're going to have a fantastic third quarter. I think next year will be one of the strongest years we've had. And this is with California being closed down. This is where North Carolina and Michigan and tremendous States—great States—are being closed by—for reasons, I think, that would—that Scott would tell you—you would disagree with, right? You disagree with. He—we spent a great amount of time talking about it.
We've got to open up our country. We understand the disease. We understand who it hits. We have to protect our elderly people, especially our elderly people that are not well. We have to protect them. But we understand it, and we understand it well. We've learned a lot.
And we're going to have the vaccine soon, and we're going to have the therapeutic soon. Going to come out very soon, and we're very proud of the people and the job they've done.
Yes, please. Go ahead.
2020 Democratic Presidential Candidate Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., and Vice Presidential Candidate Senator Kamala D. Harris 
Q. Thanks, Mr. President. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris just appeared together in their first campaign event, right before you've got up on this podium. Can you tell us if you watched their remarks and give us your reaction to them?
The President. I didn't watch. I saw just a moment of him speaking, a moment of her speaking, and it was enough.
Look, he made a choice: He picked her. I watched her. I watched her poll numbers go boom, boom, boom, down to almost nothing. And she left angry. She left mad. There was nobody more insulting to Biden than she was. She said horrible things about him, including accusations made about him by a woman where she, I guess, believed the woman. And now all of a sudden, she's running to be Vice President, saying how wonderful he is.
I thought it was a very unusual pick, because she said such bad things. And you know better than anybody what—you know, you won't write it because, you know, you don't want to do that—but you know better than anybody. She said horrible things about him. Horrible things. And she mocked him, openly mocked him. That's why I thought that was a very risky pick, because I'm sure that'll be played back—not necessarily by me, but others—it will be played back.
The other thing, if you look, she wants a $3 trillion tax hike. No fracking. How do you think ""no fracking"" in Pennsylvania is going to play? That's a big fracking State. If you didn't have energy produced that way, you would have taxes that would triple, and you'd have unemployment that you wouldn't believe.
And Pennsylvania, last year, had the best year they've ever had. Texas, last year, had the best year they've ever had. Oklahoma, best year. Almost every State in our Nation, last year, had the best year they've ever had. And they're going to have that again next year. And you can see that by what—but think of it: She wants no fossil fuels. No fossil fuels. Really? Tell that to Texas.
And then, I hear, ""Trump is only one point up in Texas."" No, they said the same thing with Crooked Hillary Clinton. They said: ""Texas is in play. Trump is down in Texas."" And then, I won Texas. Immediately, when they said the polls are closed, ""Trump has won Texas."" And I won by a lot. And I won Georgia by a lot. It's the same thing over—it's almost like a duplication of what happened before, except we have much more energy now than we ever did in 2016, and we had a lot. We had record amounts in 2016.
But you take a look at the tax cuts. We gave the biggest tax cut in the history of our country and the biggest regulation cuts in the history of our country, by far. Right? He wants to increase everybody's taxes. And she's one of the people that wants that.
I mean, you take a look at that. She wants to defund or at least substantially reduce money going to police departments. And you can't do that. You can't do that. It's actually got to be the opposite. I've been endorsed by so many police departments. I'm getting a really good one this week that you'll be seeing, really big, really good.
But who could ever—what police department, what law enforcement group could ever support Joe Biden, where he said things that are so bad and so foolish—frankly, so stupid—in terms of crime and what would happen. So we're getting all of law enforcement.
We're getting the military. She wants to spend much less on our military. I've rebuilt the military. We have the strongest military now. Much of the equipment is coming in, all made in the United States; $2.5 trillion, we spent.
When I took over we had a military that was totally—it was in terrible, terrible shape. It was depleted. It was a depleted military: old planes, old tanks, old everything. And we have a beautiful, brandnew military with the best people in the world. We never had anything like it. Some of the equipment is still coming in.
No, we have—we've done a real job. And I think we're going to be extremely successful. I was surprised that he picked her—very surprised—because of the horrible way she talked about him. And frankly, because she dropped like a rock.
I didn't when I ran. I ran against 17 people, mostly Governors and Senators, some others. Ben Carson was very strong, very good. A couple of others, but mostly Governors, mostly Senators. And I ran, and I went up.
She ran, and she went down to rock bottom. I don't think she ever got to run her first—to take a vote in her first—in the first State. And so, generally speaking, you don't want to pick somebody that went down, and she went down. But she went down in a very terrible way, and she said horrible things about Biden.
She said far worse about Biden than I ever did. And now she's running as Vice President. So how does that work?
Please, in the back.
School Reopening Efforts 
Q. Mr. President, thank you for taking my question. I'm wondering tonight if you might have any words of encouragement for middle schoolers or high schoolers starting the school year strictly online who might be frustrated, wondering how they're going to get through the next quarter, missing their friends and teachers? Just wondering if you might have any words of encouragement for them.
The President. It's such a fair question, such a good question. Yes, I mean, you hear what I was saying and what—Scott will be involved, and he'll be talking to you over the next couple of days—what he's saying from great experience. No, I feel very badly for them. And I have a feeling that on November 4, somebody is going to announce: ""Schools are open. The country is open. Everything is open."" I really believe a lot of it is done for political reasons, if you want to know the truth. I think so.
But you're right; online is not the same as being in the classroom. And that's been proven. It's been proven loud and clear.
Yes. Any other questions?
Q. Mr. President——
Q. On the economy, Mr. President——
The President. Go ahead. Go ahead, please. Please.
Public Housing/Demographic Composition of Suburbs/Zoning in Suburban Areas 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You have sworn several times that if Joe Biden is elected President that there will be an invasion in suburban neighborhoods. It's a sentiment that you expressed in a——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——tweet again this morning. What exactly do you mean by ""invasion""?
The President. What I mean is, people are going to become—they are going to be opening up areas of your neighborhood—which they're doing, and now they're going to do—they wanted to expand it. And they will expand it. If, for any reason—they're going to, in my opinion, destroy suburbia.
And just so you understand, 30 percent-plus of the people living in suburbia are minorities. African American, Asian American, Hispanic American—they're minorities. Thirty percent. The number is even higher, it's—they say 35, but I like to cut it a little bit lower. You know why? That way I can never get myself in too much trouble with the fake news. But 30 percent-plus are minorities living in suburbia.
And when they go in and they want to change zoning so that you have lots of problems, where they want to build low-income housing—you want something where people can aspire to be there, not something where it gets hurt badly. And that's what happens.
So, with suburban women, suburban men, I think they feel very strongly about what I'm doing. It's a very—I mean, it's a very fair question. It's a very important question. But they fought all their lives to be there, and then all of a sudden, they have—something happened that changes their life and changes what they fought for, for so many years.
John [John Roberts, Fox News], please.
Republican Presidential Nomination Acceptance Speech Location 
Q. Quick—two quick ones, if I could, Mr. President. I know you were briefed on it; have you decided where are you're going to give your acceptance speech yet?
The President. So we're looking at Gettysburg.
Q. I know that.
The President. A magnificent site. I've been there a number of times. Just a magnificent site. And we're looking at the White House. And I would say it's really down to those two.
The White House would be a much easier, from the standpoint of Secret Service and, you know, the movement of hundreds of people, as you know. Q. Which way are you leaning?
The President. I would say we love them both. I love Gettysburg, but it's—this is simpler. It would be magnificent. The White House is a—the White House is the White House. Gettysburg is one of the great and historic sites of our country—frankly, as far as I'm concerned, of the world. So one of those two. I'll probably be announcing it over the next week or so, maybe less.
Payroll Tax Cut 
Q. And then, I had a question about payroll taxes. If you permanently rescind the payroll tax, how do you pay for Social Security?
The President. We're taking it out of the general fund. And what we'll do——
Q. But that would incur huge deficits.
The President. Yes, what we'll be doing is, if we do that, we'll get it approved, in that case, by Congress. And we'll take the money from other places, other than—we will not take it from Social Security in——
Q. Right, but——
The President. ——any way shape or form.
Q. How do you fund it from the general fund, when the general fund just incurred a debt of $2.8 trillion?
The President. You're right, but we're going to have tremendous growth. We have tremendous growth. You take a look at what's happening here.
Next year—unless somebody comes in who doesn't know what they're doing and they start raising taxes and forcing everybody to leave the country or leave their jobs and companies to close—we will have tremendous growth. You will see growth like you haven't seen in a long time.
Okay.
Q. Mr. President, Mr. President——
The President. Yes, please.
2020 Democratic Vice Presidential Candidate Senator Kamala D. Harris/Federal Coronavirus Response/Coronavirus Testing Access and Technology 
Q. Mr. President, since you didn't see Kamala Harris's remarks today, I wonder if we could just get you to respond to one thing that she said?
The President. Sure.
Q. She said that your ""refusal to get testing up and running""; your—I'm paraphrasing—your ""flip-flopping on social distancing and masks""; and your ""delusional belief that you know better than the experts—all of that,"" in her words, are ""reason"" that one American dies of COVID-19 every minute. What do you think of that?
The President. I think that's probably one of the reasons she was a terrible candidate and was forced to leave the race, because she got her facts wrong. You know she's very bad on facts. She is very weak on facts.
And, just so you understand: We've done more testing than any country in the world, by far. That includes India, which has 1.5 billion people. That includes China. That includes every country in the world. We've done more testing. We have better testing than any country in the world. They call; they want to know: ""Where do we get it? How do we get it?"" We have better testing than any country in the world.
When you do as much testing as us, however, as you understand, you develop more cases. If you tested instead of 65 million people, which is what we've done—when you test that many people—you're going to find cases that normally you wouldn't see.
If you go to Mexico and you go to other countries, you'll see they do almost no testing. They test if somebody is not feeling well. They test if somebody is symptomatic. They test very little. They test very little.
We've done more testing than anybody in the world. We've done the best job of any country in the world, and that includes from making ventilators that nobody else could have done. We are the ventilator king of the world. We're supplying the whole world now, in a few short months, with ventilators that are very hard to produce, very expensive, very complex, very delicate, very, very important. We've done a great job.
And then, on top of that, when you look at the numbers—how we were impacted less than these other countries. And now, you look at the explosion of countries that you would have said ""did such a good job,"" and some of them had advantages over us for obvious reasons, having to do with the pandemic. But when you look at the job that we've done compared to others, we've done a great job.
And she—I read today that she's very short on facts. She—I think she's going to be a big failure. And I think—I look forward to the debate between her and Mike Pence, because I think he'll do even better against her than he did about—against Senator Kaine, which was a total wipeout. So we'll see how it all works out.
Q. Mr. President——
The President. All right, one more.
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Yes, please, in the back.
Q. Mr. President, thank you very much.
The President. Go ahead.
Q. Me?
The President. You in the back, please.
2020 Presidential Election/Absentee Voting Policies 
Q. Thank you. I'd just ask what do you say to those critics who argue you're trying to sow distrust in democracy and deliberately trying to sabotage the Post Office—to undermining mail-in voting, which a lot of people need?
The President. Yes. I say the Democrats are sabotaging the Post Office because they're not approving $25 billion that was requested. So they're sabotaging the Post Office, and they're not allowing the Post Office to function properly, and they're certainly not allowing universal mail-in votes if—when they do that.
But equally importantly, they're not allowing $3.5 billion in funds to do voting that they'd like to do. Therefore all of this—and all of the tremendous mistakes that were made with regard to mail-in voting—all of these tremendous mistakes, you can't even—you can't even do it. I would imagine the courts—you know, this is in many courts right now. They're showing all of the disasters that have taken place just in the last short period of time—in the last 2 months—with respect to universal mail-in voting. It's just, like, a total catastrophe what's happening. And we can't let that happen.
Go ahead, real fast. Go ahead.
Q. Mr. President—[inaudible].
Coronavirus Mortality Rates 
Q. Thank you very much. Two questions. One is about—you had graphs about the economics of COVID——
The President. Right.
Q. ——but deaths in America are still going up. Whereas in Europe, right now: zero deaths in U.K., zero deaths in France.
The President. Yes. Well, it's going up by cases. If you look at cases. And the cases are going up because we do so much testing and we find it. And I call it ""fake-media gold"" because we do so much more testing than any other country. And when you do all that testing, you find cases.
Go ahead, Steve. Real fast. Go ahead.
China-U.S. Trade/Coronavirus Outbreak in China 
Q. A quick one on trade: You've got these trade talks with China going on. Is it possible you would pull out of the trade deal with China if they're not meeting their commitment?
The President. We've taken a lot of money from China on the last year and a half that no other President has taken in. We've done things to China that nobody else has done to China, or even thought of doing—with 25-percent tariffs and taking in billions and billions of dollars—tens of billions of dollars. And giving them—giving the farmers, as an example, $12 billion one year, $16 billion another year—and made the farmers extremely happy. You don't hear them complaining. They were targeted by China.
But I'm very angry at China because they let this horrible disease—they let this horrible plague come into our country and come into the world. And they should have been able to stop it. They stopped it from going into China. They should have been able to stop it. So I'm very angry at China.
Thank you very much. Thank you."
"August 19, 2020",The President's News Conference,Donald J. Trump,"Donald J. Trump, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/343453",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1258,"The President.  Well, thank you very much. Before I provide an update on our continued progress against the China virus, I'd like to discuss our latest actions against the Iranian regime.
Today I'm directing the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, to notify the U.N. Security Council that the United States intends to restore virtually all of the previously suspended United Nations sanctions on Iran. It's a snapback, not uncommon.
Two years ago, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal, which was a product of the Obama-Biden foreign policy failure, a failure like few people have seen, in terms of the amount of money we paid for absolutely nothing and a short-term deal. This deal funneled tens of billions of dollars to Iran—$150 billion, to be exact—plus $1.8 billion in cash, which I don't know that the President had the authority to give; gave $1.8 billion in cash. Just another great deal that turned out to be a total disaster, that would have funded all of the chaos and the bloodshed and the terror in the region and all throughout the world.
And I won't say anything, because I don't like saying it, but Iran doesn't have so much money to give to the world anymore, to the terrorists, to give to Al Qaida and various other groups of people that they were funding. They have to keep their own regime together, and it's not easy for them.
And if and when I win the election, within the first month, Iran will come to us and they are going to be asking for a deal so quickly because they are doing very poorly.
But that deal was a disaster: $150 billion; $1.8 billion in cash. And we got nothing, except a short-term, little deal. A short-term, expiring. It's starting to expire already. It's terminated, but it would have, if we didn't terminate it, start to expire very shortly.
A good deal was the deal we made with U.A.E. and Israel. And, by the way, other countries, I will tell you now, want to come into that deal, countries that you wouldn't even believe want to come into that deal. And, all of a sudden, you're going to have peace in the Middle East, and you couldn't have done it with this ridiculous Iran nuclear deal, as they call it, that President Obama made along with Sleepy Joe Biden.
I imposed the toughest ever sanctions on Iran, and this has caused great difficulty for them giving money to terrorist organizations. And if they do, they'll have hell to pay.
Earlier this year, I ordered the strike that took out the world's number-one terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, in addition to previously terminating leader and founder of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the two leading terrorists by far in the world. The founder of ISIS. Nobody even talks about that. And we also defeated—we now have 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate in Syria. When I took over, it was a mess. It was a total mess. It was—they were all over the place.
My administration will not allow this Iran nuclear situation to go on. They will never have a nuclear weapon. Iran will never have—mark it down. Mark it down: Iran will never have a nuclear weapon. When the United States entered into the Iran deal, it was clear that the United States would always have the right to restore the U.N. sanctions that will prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. We paid a fortune for a failed concept and a failed policy, a policy that would have made it impossible to have peace in the Middle East. Here at home, through Operation LeGend, we are confronting the wave of crime in Democrat-run American cities. It's absolutely shocking. When you look at Portland or New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, sometimes Los Angeles—Democrat-run cities—they're a mess because they don't get it. Either they don't get it or there's something that nobody else understands.
We've deployed more than 1,000 additional Federal agents to help these Democrat-run disasters. We just have done this. We have to give them a hand. And we can stop it immediately, like at Portland would be so easy to stop. We'd stop it immediately.
We only sent in some Homeland people—who are great, by the way—to save the courthouse, because it would have been blown up or burned down, and they did that very easily. But if we were called upon, we would send in, whether it's Homeland, whether it's FBI, whether it's just law enforcement—and we'd send them in quickly. We would eradicate it, just like happened in Minneapolis. As soon as they were called in—they should have been called in a lot sooner; you would have had far less damage.
Today we announced that Operation LeGend has successfully resulted in nearly 1,500 arrests already. Bad ones. Bad ones. Really bad people. Prosecutions and prison sentences will follow. And they'll be a very long time in prison for what they've done to these cities. Most cities are well run; most of the Nation is well run. And the areas that we're talking about are all—in all cases, run by Democrats, usually radical-left-leaning Democrats, like in New York or in Portland.
We've made arrests in Kansas City, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Memphis, and Albuquerque for many violent crimes, including gun crimes, arson, and 91 murders.
We're also using the full power of the Federal Government to defeat, as you know, the China virus. New cases have declined in 80 percent of the jurisdictions in the past week. Eighty percent. New Zealand, by the way, had a big outbreak. And other countries that were held up to try and make us look not as good as we should look—because we've done an incredible job—but they're having a lot of outbreaks, but they'll be able to put them out, and we put them out.
The hospitalization rate has fallen in our country, 54 percent since its peak in April. Fifty-four percent. Older Americans are still the most vulnerable to the virus: 92 percent of deaths have occurred among those 55 and older. Only 2.7 percent of deaths have occurred among those 44 years—think of that—44 years and younger. So 44 years old and younger: only 2.7 percent of deaths have occurred. And many of those people had preexisting conditions, they had problems—heart, diabetes, and other problems, but—many of those. So think of that: only 2.7 percent under 44 years of age.
Excess mortality in Europe this year is 33 percent higher than the United States, evidence that the tragic cost of this virus is higher in other Western nations. South Korea—you've been reading about South Korea doing well. Well, they just had a very big breakout, but they'll be able to solve the problem.
We must all remain vigilant and continue to exercise extreme caution around those at highest risk, as we know. Multiple colleges and universities announced that they would suspend in-person teaching. We have learned one thing: There's nothing like campus, there's nothing like being with the teacher as opposed to being on a computer board. It's been proven a lot better. It's a lot better. The iPads are wonderful, but you're not going to learn the same way you do by being there. So, nevertheless, certain colleges and universities have announced that they would suspend the in-person teaching. For older people and individuals with underlying conditions, the China virus is very dangerous, but for university students, the likelihood of severe illness is less than or equal to the risk of a seasonal few—a seasonal flu. And the seasonal flu happens and comes and it goes, and it can be very bad, but people don't talk about it in the same way, and they shouldn't. But if you look at that, the odds are less than or equal to.
Instead of saving lives, the decision to close universities could cost lives. It is significantly safer for students to live with other young people than to go home and spread the virus to older Americans. Makes sense.
And the shutdown thing is causing tremendous depression for those places that are still shut down. You look at certain areas that—in all cases, Democrat run—still shut down, and the numbers there aren't even good. But causing tremendous depression, suicide, drugs, alcohol abuse. A lot of problems are being caused—probably far more, I would say, Scott, than is caused by the virus itself, now that we understand the virus.
Colleges should take reasonable precautions. Students who feel sick should not attend class and should limit social interaction, as they would for any other illness. And universities should implement measures to protect the high-risk students or professors and teachers.
The ultimate goal of testing is to prevent transmission in high-risk settings—and to prevent transmission, period, but especially in nursing homes—and to care for the vulnerable and our elderly, which really fit into that definition of who is vulnerable.
We have tremendous unused testing capacity in our country. We have a tremendous unused testing capacity. It's something that a lot of other nations are very impressed with, they tell us.
In our path forward, we will continue to follow a science-based approach to protecting the high-risk, while enabling healthy Americans to safely go back to work and school. Our country will be open. Our country is getting open quickly. Our stock markets are almost back to where they were, prior to the China virus disaster coming in.
And I want to thank you all for being here, and we'll take some questions.
Yes, please.
QAnon Conspiracy Theory/Protests and Civil Unrest in U.S. Cities/Deployment of Federal Law Enforcement Officers to U.S Cities 
Q. During the pandemic, the QAnon movement has been—appears to be gaining a lot of followers. Can you talk about what you think about that and what you have to say to people who are following this movement right now?
The President. Well, I don't know much about the movement, other than I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate, but I don't know much about the movement. I have heard that it is gaining in popularity. And from what I hear, it's—these are people that, when they watch the streets of Portland, when they watch what happened in New York City in just the last 6 or 7 months—but this was starting even 4 years ago when I came here. Almost 4 years; can you believe it? These are people that don't like seeing what's going on in places like Portland and places like Chicago and New York and other cities and States. And I've heard these are people that love our country, and they just don't like seeing it.
So I don't know, really, anything about it other than they do, supposedly, like me. And they also would like to see problems in these areas—like, especially the areas that we're talking about—go away. Because there's no reason the Democrats can't run a city. And if they can't, we will send in all of the Federal—whether it's troops or law enforcement, whatever they'd like—we'll send them in. We'll straighten out their problem in 24 hours or less. Okay?
Q. And, Mr. President, at the crux of the theory is this belief that you are secretly saving the world from this satanic cult of pedophiles and cannibals. Does that sound like something you are behind or a believer in?
The President. Well, I haven't heard that. But is that supposed to be a bad thing or a good thing? I mean, you know, if I can help save the world from problems, I'm willing to do it. I'm willing to put myself out there.
And we are, actually. We're saving the world from a radical-left philosophy that will destroy this country. And when this country is gone, the rest of the world would follow. The rest of the world would follow. That's the importance of this country.
And when you look at some of the things that these people are saying, with ""defund the police"" and no borders, open borders—everybody just pour right into our country; no testing, no nothing. You know, you talk about testing—no testing. Mexico, as you know, has a very high rate of infection.
The wall is now going to be, next week, 300 miles long. Our numbers are extraordinary on the border. Had that—and this is through luck, perhaps, more than talent, although the talent is getting built when one party refuses to allow it. You don't hear talk about the wall anymore.
But I will say this: We need strength in our country, not weakness. Too much weakness.
Yes, John [John Roberts, Fox News]. Please.
Coronavirus Vaccine and Treatment Development 
Q. Mr. President, you have been very bullish on the promise of convalescent plasma——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——to treat coronavirus. The FDA appeared to be on the brink of issuing an emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma. But after hearing from top officials at the NIH that there wasn't enough evidence to go ahead with that, the FDA has put that on pause. Your reaction to that? And do you believe that convalescent plasma should be in the arsenal of treatments for coronavirus?
The President. Well, I hear great things about it, John. That's all I can tell you. And it could be a political decision, because you have a lot of people over there that don't want to rush things because they want to do it after November 3. And you've heard that one before.
But I've heard fantastic things about convalescent plasma. And I've heard numbers way over 50-percent success. And people are dying, and we should have it approved if it's good. And I'm hearing it's good. I heard from people at the FDA that it's good. So we'll see. I'm going to check that right after this conference.
Q. It's my understanding that the White House will encourage the NIH and the FDA to get this out there as quickly as possible. Is that correct?
The President. Well, if the numbers are as good as I'm hearing—I mean, I'm hearing over 50 percent, and that's very good. And we've approved—certain things are at 31 percent, and that's okay, too; that's not bad. And it's really had a tremendous impact.
But, no, I have—you're telling me something right now that surprises me, but we'll check it out right after this.
Q. Are you concerned about a delay?
The President. I don't want delays. I don't want people dying. I don't want people dying.
Yes, please. Go ahead.
Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company 
Q. Mr. President, I want to ask you about your tweet earlier today on Goodyear. It was essentially calling for a boycott on Goodyear tires.
The President. Yes.
Q. Do you want the Federal Government to stop buying and using Goodyear product as well? And is there anything——
The President. Well, I'm not happy with Goodyear, because what they're doing is playing politics. And the funny thing is, the people that work for Goodyear, I can guarantee you I poll very well with all of those great workers in Goodyear.
And when they say that you can't have ""Blue Lives Matter,"" you can't show a blue line, you can't wear a MAGA hat, but you can have other things that are Marxist in nature, there's something wrong with the top of Goodyear.
And what the radical left does is, they make it impossible for people to do business if they're Republican or if they're conservative. They put out all sorts of effort: ""Don't shop there."" They do vicious things, not so different than what you saw on the streets of Portland 2 nights ago.
Q. But what kind of boycott do you envision?
The President. Oh, I don't know. That's up to people. But I wouldn't recommend it. If they want to hold political speech, if they want to let you not do what everybody is doing; if they want to wear a MAGA hat or if they want to wear a ""Blue Lives""—you know what ""Blue Lives Matter,"" right? That's police men and women. That's a terrible thing. That's a terrible thing.
So they're using their power over these people, and these people want to wear whatever it is that we're talking about. You know that. And so I would be very much in favor if people don't want to buy there. And you know what? They'll be able to get a good job, because we set a jobs record over the last quarter, as you know. The most jobs ever in the history of our country. You'll be able to get another good jobs. I think it's disgraceful that they did this.
Please, go ahead, in the back.
Next Digital Ltd. Founder Jimmy Lai/Hong Kong 
Q. Yes. Mr. President, you've said that the arrest of Jimmy Lai in Hong Kong is, quote, ""a terrible thing."" Do you have a message for Jimmy Lai? Has your administration spoken directly with him? Is your State Department working for his release?
The President. Well, I send him best wishes. I hear he's a wonderful gentleman. He's certainly a brave man. And I send him best wishes.
With that being said, because of that and obviously what happened in Hong Kong, we've taken all of the vast amounts of money that we use to subsidize Hong Kong. We essentially subsidized Hong Kong by giving them all sorts of incentives. And that's what made Hong Kong—the exchange and business in Hong Kong—successful. I've taken it all back. That means that the United States is going to do a lot more business. You know, we really gave them tremendous incentive and subsidy in order that they be successful for freedom.
But now that the freedom obviously seems to have been taken away, we will keep all of the incentives that we were giving them, which is billions and billions of dollars. And all of that business will come into our country, including the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. And it'll all come here.
But I feel badly for him because I hear he's a good person. I don't know him, but I hear he's a good person; obviously, a very brave person.
Did you have something? Go ahead, please.
Iraq/Drawdown of U.S. Troops From Afghanistan/Syria/Turkey/U.S. Military Strength 
Q. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. With the Iraqi Prime Minister coming in tomorrow, what about——
The President. Say it?
Q. The Iraqi Prime Minister is coming in tomorrow to meet with you. And how do you feel about this notion that Iraq can once again become the buffer between Iranian influence and Russian influence in the Middle East? Do you feel that under this Prime Minister that that's possible once again? What are your thoughts on it?
The President. Well, this is a man that I get along with very well. We're largely out of Iraq. We're down to a very few soldiers. I said we're getting out of these endless wars, these ridiculous, endless wars. We should have never been there in the first place. I think it was the worst decision made in the history of our country. Should have never been there. In the Middle East, we should have never been. But we're getting out rapidly, out of—you know, over the course of 3 years. And getting out—it's very sticky getting out. And some people agree, and many people don't agree, but I think most people very much agree.
We're doing very well in our negotiations with Afghanistan. We're getting out. We're down to a much smaller number of people left there. And you know, I greet men and women coming home, and coming home after they've been hit. I've also greeted many, many at Dover, greeted many bodies coming back in.
And we've been there 19 years, and we're basically policemen. We're acting as police, as opposed to soldiers. And they're going to have to police their own states, and they've been doing that for thousands of years. But it's time, after 19 years, that our soldiers come home.
They've done an incredible job, but you know, they don't—they're not allowed to fight to win. And maybe they shouldn't be, because a lot of the people—it's not their fault. But with the Taliban and with going to Iraq—again, we're down in Afghanistan; very low numbers. And that'll be taking place.
And I let them know, ""Do anything, and you'll be hit like you've never hit—be hit—been hit before."" So we're doing very well. Syria, the same thing. Remember when I took all of the soldiers off of the border between Syria and Turkey. Right? And everybody said, ""Oh, this is""—that was 2 years ago. It was a long time ago. They said: ""Oh, this is terrible, terrible, terrible. We're going to leave.""
Why do we have our soldiers between Syria and Turkey? Turkey can definitely take care of itself. I have a very good relationship with President Erdogan. And Syria has been fighting forever. And I say, ""Why are we guarding their border?"" And I brought our soldiers back home. I got them out. And guess what? Nothing's happened. They've been fighting like they have been for a thousand years. Okay? Nothing's happened. And nobody mentions that.
Everybody said, ""This is going to be a disaster."" There's no disaster; nothing's happened. And so we're getting out of the endless wars. And we are building a military, the likes of which the world has never seen: $2½ trillion we have spent. And we, hopefully, don't ever have to use it. But we want to focus on a much bigger picture, because we have a much bigger picture.
It's—when you look at what China is doing, when you look at what Russia is doing, when you look at what some other countries are doing, we want to be ready just in case there is a catastrophe. We don't want to see that; we don't want to ever use it. We've rebuilt our military: new missiles and new rockets and new tanks and new everything. New everything—$2½ trillion—all made in the U.S.A.
And we've upgraded incredibly our nuclear capability. And some of our nuclear needed nourishment. It needed new strength. And we've upgraded it very, very significantly. I mean, to a level that nobody would even believe. And hopefully, we don't—you pray to God we never have to use it. Okay? But we've never been in a position where we've been this strong.
Please.
Saudi Arabia-Israel Relations/United Arab Emirates Purchase of U.S. Military Equipment/United Arab Emirates-Israel Relations/Iran 
Q. Mr. President, thank you so much. I wanted to ask you about the Middle East. I have a couple questions. You mentioned that other countries are interested in following suit——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——after the Emiratis——
The President. Having to do with U.A.E. and Israel.
Q. Exactly.
The President. Correct.
Q. So is—do you expect that Saudi Arabia will join? And——
The President. I do.
Q. Yes. And also, the Emiratis have expressed interest in the F-35. Do you think that that should be something that they could look forward to in the future? Is there some sort of time delay?
The President. No, I think they'll—I think—look, they've definitely got the money to pay for it. You know, it's nice because usually when we—a lot of times, we make deals; they don't have 10 cents, these countries we deal with. We give it to them like, ""How about paying this back later?"" But they never pay because they don't have the money.
No, they have the money, and they would like to order quite a few F-35s; it's the greatest fighter jet in the world, as you know, by far. Stealth. Totally stealth. You can't see it. Makes it very difficult. I was asking a pilot: ""What do you think is better, this one? This one? That one?"" Talking about Russian planes, Chinese planes. He said, ""Well, the advantage we have is you can't see it."" So when we're fighting, they can't see us. I say, ""That sounds like a really big advantage to me."" To these guys——
Q. But the Israelis don't want them to have it.
The President. You know, they look—by the way, I said to these pilots that I meet—they look better than Tom Cruise, and they're definitely tougher. And he's a nice guy. But these people are amazing. And I speak to them a lot about it—""What do you think?""—you know, as I go around to the various places. I saved the big one in Florida, as an example. That was a big one. Knocked down, pretty much, by the hurricane. So I spent a lot of time on that. And it's the greatest plane in the world. One thing about that kind of thing—technology, high-technology—the greatest plane doesn't last long. Somebody comes up with something else, but we're always the one to come up with something else.
So yes, they'd like to buy F-35s; we'll see what happens. It's under review, but they made a great advance in peace in the Middle East. Even the New York Times thought it was an incredible deal. Can you imagine that? Tom Friedman had a very nice thing to say about it. I spoke to him about it. He thought it was terrific. And it is terrific.
I see a lot of countries coming in fairly quickly. And when you have them all in, ultimately, Iran will come in too. There'll be peace in the Middle East. That will be a nice. Iran will be very much neutralized. They never thought this could have happened.
And with the horrendously stupid Iran deal signed by Obama, this could have never happened.
Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company 
Q. The Israelis are still——
Q. Can I follow on something, Mr. President? On the Goodyear issue: You ride on Goodyear tires——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——in the Presidential limousine.
The President. Correct.
Q. If there were an alternative, would you want those tires swapped out?
The President. Yes, I would do that. I would. I would swap them out, based on what I heard. We'll see what happens. Hey, look, you're going to have a lot of people not wanting to buy that product anymore, and they'll buy from a competitor, made in the U.S.A. too. Okay?
Please. Go ahead.
Former President Barack Obama/National Economy/Coronavirus Outbreak in China 
Q. Mr. President, excerpts from Obama's speech that he will—he'll give later at the Democratic Convention show that he will—he says that he hoped that you would take being President more ""seriously"" once you have the job and ""discover . . . reverence for democracy."" And then he said, I quote, ""But he never did."" What is your reaction to that?
The President. You know, when I listen to that and then I see the horror that he's left us, the stupidity of the transactions that he made. Look what we're doing: We have our great border wall. We have security. We have the U.A.E. deal, which has been universally praised, praised by people that aren't exactly fans of Donald Trump for various reasons. I don't know why; can't be my personality. But they're not fans. Right?
And when I look at what we have—now, look at how bad he was, how ineffective a President he was. He was so ineffective, so terrible. Slowest growing recovery in the history—I guess, since 1929—on the economy.
Don't forget, until the China virus came in, we had the greatest economy in the history of the world. And now we're doing it again. I'm going to have to do it a second time. We're doing it again—hard to believe. We're doing very well. You heard the numbers; they're way, way down on the virus. But when you look at the kind of numbers that we're producing on the stock markets, we're almost at the level—in fact, NASDAQ and S&P are higher than they were at their highest point prior to the China virus coming in, the plague coming in.
No, President Obama did not do a good job. And the reason I'm here is because of President Obama and Joe Biden. Because if they did a good job, I wouldn't be here. And probably, if they did a good job, I wouldn't have even run. I would have been very happy. I enjoyed my previous life very much, but they did such a bad job that I stand before you as President.
Thank you all very much. Thank you."

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/343388",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1256,"The President. Well, thank you very much. And it's good to see you all. Hope you had a great weekend at your convention. And we're going to have a great convention coming up, and I look forward to it.
But before I discuss a very historic breakthrough in our fight against the China virus, I'd like to provide an update on the recent wildfires in California and the storms in the Gulf of Mexico.
Yesterday I approved a major disaster declaration for California—spoke to Governor Newsom—as they battle two of the worst wildfires in the history of their State. That continues. The Federal Government has already deployed over 26,000 first responders and personnel to battle the wildfires. We're working very closely with the Governor and very closely with a lot of great State representatives and local representatives, and we'll take care of the situation. But we have 26,000 first responders already.
Our hearts go out to the thousands of families who have lost their homes. As we grieve for the families of two first responders and five residents who have tragically lost their lives in a very horrific fire, one of the biggest we've ever seen. My administration is also closely monitoring Hurricane Marco and Tropical Storm Laura, which are coming in rapidly. Hurricane Marco is expected to make landfall in Louisiana tomorrow, and Tropical Storm Laura is expected to hit Louisiana 2 days later. This is somewhat unprecedented: the scope of the storms and also the fact that they come so quickly after one another.
Both storms have the potential of gathering strength before they make landfall and could cause significant damage across the Gulf Coast and also in Puerto Rico. We have everybody stationed and ready to go in Puerto Rico and the Gulf Coast, and we have tremendous—and tremendous people.
We have—FEMA is lined up. We have the Coast Guard ready. The Coast Guard has done a fantastic job. They do so many—they do such good work, and we want to thank our great Coast Guard.
I'm asking all Americans in the storm's path to follow the instructions of your State and local Governments very closely. And I've approved emergency declarations for Puerto Rico and for Louisiana. FEMA is mobilized on the ground and is ready to help. They will be in there very quickly—very, very quickly.
And I spoke to Governor John Bel Edwards also, of Louisiana, and I've informed him. And at his request, also, a major disaster declaration is signed and ready to go. We have everybody ready in Puerto Rico, the Gulf Coast, Louisiana, and also on the forest fires in California. So we have a great team. Unfortunately, we have some very, very powerful natural disasters.
On the therapeutics front, this is what I've been looking to do for a long time. This is a great thing. Today I'm pleased to make a truly historic announcement in our battle against the China virus that will save countless lives. The FDA has issued an emergency use authorization—and that's such a powerful term: emergency use authorization—for a treatment known as convalescent plasma. This is a powerful therapy that transfuses very, very strong antibodies from the blood of recovered patients to help treat patients battling a current infection. It's had an incredible rate of success. Today's action will dramatically expand access to this treatment. And I want to thank Dr. Hahn and Secretary Azar. I want to thank the FDA—all of the people that have been working very hard on this. It showed tremendous potential.
This is the only possible—and it's only made possible because of Operation Warp Speed—that is everybody working together. We're years ahead of approvals. We would be—if we went by the speed levels of past administration, we'd be 2 years, 3 years behind where we are today, and that includes in vaccines that you'll be hearing about very soon, very shortly.
To deliver treatments and vaccine to save lives, we're removing unnecessary barriers and delays, not by cutting corners, but by marshaling the full power of the Federal Government.
We've provided $48 million to fund the Mayo Clinic study that tested the efficacy of convalescent plasma for patients with the virus. Through this study, over 100,000 Americans have already enrolled to receive this treatment, and it has proven to reduce mortality by 35 percent. It's a tremendous number.
The FDA, MIT, Harvard, and Mount Sinai hospital have also found convalescent plasma to be a very effective method of fighting this horrible disease.
Based on the science and the data, the FDA has made the independent determination that the treatment is safe and very effective. Recently, we provided up to $270 million to the American Red Cross and America's Blood Centers to support the collection of up to 360,000 units of plasma.
In late July, we launched a nationwide campaign to ask patients to have—who have recovered—and these are patients that have been incredible, the way they've donated—but these are people recovered from the virus—to donate plasma. Since then, weekly plasma donations have doubled.
And today I once again urge all Americans who have recovered from the virus to go to coronavirus.gov and sign up and donate plasma today, please. It's been really an incredible—just incredible people. The country has united so strongly behind this.
And I'll go over the numbers, but if you look at what's happened and the success that we've had that people don't talk about, the United States has experienced the lowest case-fatality rate of any major country in the world. You don't hear that.
The European Union's case-fatality rate is estimated to be three times higher than that in the United States. Europe has seen 33 percent more fatalities, compared to a typical non-pandemic year than the United States.
And I just want to ask two of our people that have done such a fantastic job, Alex Azar and Stephen Hahn, to say a few words. And, Stephen, I want to thank you because the FDA really stepped up—and especially over the last few days—in getting this done. The results have been incredible, and I think you'll see the results even go up very substantially. So we appreciate it.
And maybe I'll ask Alex to go first, and then Stephen. Thank you very much, Alex.
Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex M. Azar II. Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. Thanks for the bold leadership that allowed us to deliver this very happy news today.
Thanks to your all-of-America approach, America has done more than any other country to expand the arsenal that we have to battle COVID-19. And thanks to early efforts by your administration, Americans have broader access to these treatments, including convalescent plasma, than patients anywhere else in the world. In early April, early in our fight against COVID-19, the FDA, BARDA, the Mayo Clinic, and other partners sprang into action to set up an expanded access protocol for this promising treatment.
President Trump is the ""right to try"" President, and he's fought hard to ensure that Americans can have access to promising COVID-19 treatments. Convalescent plasma has been a tried-and-true therapeutic method in prior outbreaks, but the President wanted to ensure that we develop the data to support its use, and this FDA authorization is one result of that effort.
The data we gathered suggests that patients who were treated early in their disease course—within 3 days of being diagnosed—with plasma containing high levels of antibodies benefited the most from treatment. We saw about a 35-percent better survival in the patients who benefited most from the treatment, which were patients under 80 who were not on artificial respiration.
I just want to emphasize this point, because I don't want you to gloss over this number. We dream, in drug development, of something like a 35-percent mortality reduction. This is a major advance in the treatment of patients. This is a major advance.
Convalescent plasma is one new tool that we've added to our arsenal against COVID-19, alongside remdesivir, steroids, and a number of other promising options currently being studied. Because of the President's Operation Warp Speed, we expect to have other new results and new options reaching patients as soon as this fall.
Operation Warp Speed is supporting experimental therapeutics all the way through to manufacturing, so that if they meet FDA's gold standard for safety and efficacy, they can begin reaching patients without a day wasted.
Americans who have tested positive for and recovered from COVID-19 can go to coronavirus.gov to find out a quick, convenient way to play a potentially lifesaving role in our fight. Know: If you donate plasma, you could save a life.
We've also provided guidance so health care providers can contact patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and give them information on how they can donate.
So, thank you again, Mr. President, for supporting this remarkable progress against COVID-19. And I want to thank Dr. Hahn, Dr. Marks, and the entire team at the FDA for the speed with which they've approached this, the diligence to ensure that this meets the standards at FDA.
And I'll turn it over to Dr. Hahn if that's okay, Mr. President.
The President. Good. Thank you very much.
Please, Doctor.
Commissioner of Food and Drugs Stephen M. Hahn. Thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership. It's good to be here today to announce FDA's recent decision. From the beginning of this pandemic, the President has asked FDA to cut back red tape to try to speed medical products into the hands of providers, patients, and American consumers. And I just want to echo the President's thanks to the more than 17,000 men and women who work at FDA. They have worked day and night to, in fact, do that.
So plasma is the liquid portion of the blood. That liquid portion contains the natural immunity that someone develops in response to an infection—in this case, COVID-19—and that liquid portion can be extracted. And for many years, as the President and Secretary Azar said, it's been given to patients with infectious diseases—for more than 100 years. So there was a really good rationale for why this might work. And, in fact, as was mentioned, in early April, an expanded-access program was started at the Mayo Clinic with the support of the Federal Government, under President Trump's leadership, and that has gone on for the last 4 months. More than 90,000, close to 100,000 Americans have enrolled in this program, and over 70,000 have received treatment. This is one of the largest expanded-access programs in the history of FDA. So a very successful approach to evaluating how convalescent plasma would work.
So, in the independent judgment of experts and expert scientists at FDA who have reviewed the totality of data—not just the data from this expanded-access program, but more than a dozen published studies, as well as the historical experience associated with this. Those scientists have concluded that COVID-19 convalescent plasma is safe and shows promising efficacy, thereby meeting the criteria for an emergency use authorization.
In the optimal treatment—the optimal patients, as described by Secretary Azar, treated with convalescent plasma at the highest titers, there was a 35-percent improvement in survival, which is a significant clinical benefit.
Now, we're waiting for more data. We're going to continue to gather data. But this clearly meets the criteria that we've established for emergency use authorization, and we're very pleased with these results.
So let me just put this in perspective. Many of you know I was a cancer doctor before I became FDA commissioner, and a 35-percent improvement in survival is a pretty substantial clinical benefit. What that means is—and if the data continue to pan out—100 people who are sick with COVID-19, 35 would have been saved because of the administration of plasma.
We've seen a great deal of demand for this from doctors around the country. And what this EUA does—EUA—emergency use authorization today does: It allows us to continue that and meet the demand.
And again, I want to echo the President's and the Secretary's ask of the American people: If you've recovered from COVID-19, please donate. It could save a life.
And, Mr. President, thank you again.
The President. Thank you very much, Stephen. I appreciate it.
Okay, any questions, please? Please, go ahead.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to first ask you about the COVID-19 drugs that are in phase three. Are they going to be available to the American population on—you and I talked previously about this idea of ""right to try.""
The President. Right.
Coronavirus Treatment Development 
Q. Can we assure the American people that if it's being studied and it's in phase three, you have that right?
The President. You know, that's a great question. And I'm not sure a lot of people have been thinking about ""right to try."" We're all waiting for the final answer. And maybe I could ask Stephen, but I would say that ""right to try"" is exactly—if somebody is virtually terminal—in other words, they're not going to make it—and if we have these incredible therapies and drugs that are happening, Alex, I think it's a very interesting question.
I congratulate you for that question because I think——
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. ——we're all waiting for that exact final endpoint.
What about that, Stephen? We have all of these great—seemingly great answers that are ready to come out, but because of the process, it takes, though—can we use some of this early, under ""right to try""? Please.
Commissioner Hahn. So it's a really good question. And of course, it all depends on the clinical circumstances and what a doctor and a patient together decide, with respect to the administration of any agent.
But if you think about what happened with convalescent plasma and the expanded-access program, this is exactly what happened. This program—so, we have ongoing clinical trials that are randomized between placebo, or an inactive substance, and the convalescent plasma. While that was going on, we knew that there was great demand from patients and doctors. The expanded-access program is a way of actually doing that, and fits perfectly with what the President just said about allowing people to be able to use something that we have now determined to be very safe.
The President. I think it was something we have to really consider very strongly.
Commissioner Hahn. Yes, sir.
The President. I think it's fantastic.
You should get credit for that.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Thank you. That's very good.
Q. Mr. President?
The President. Please, in the back. OAN, please.
Coronavirus Treatment Development/Food and Drug Administration 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Convalescent—convalescent plasma, as a treatment, has been around for, you know, a hundred years. You mentioned Warp—Operation Warp Speed, which enabled this process to move along a lot faster. What into the—what went into the effort for this to be approved for COVID-19? And was that holdup political in nature?
The President. Well, I think that there might have been a holdup, but we broke the logjam over the last week, to be honest. I think that there are people in the FDA and actually in your larger department that can see things being held up and wouldn't mind so much. That's my opinion—a very strong opinion. And that's for political reasons. This has nothing to do with politics; this has to do with life and death.
So we are being very strong, and we are being very forthright, and we have got some incredible answers. And we're not going to let them be held up, because every day is lives. And we're not going to let that happen. Okay?
Very good. Thank you.
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Please, go ahead.
Q. Mr. President, in announcing this today, you said that the FDA has made the independent determination that the treatment is safe and very effective. Yet Dr. Hahn just said it was showing ""promising efficacy."" So which of the two is correct? The President. Well, I think I'll let Dr. Hahn answer that question.
Commissioner Hahn. So, under our legal authority for emergency use authorization, this is not the same as an approval, but it's an authorization, and allows us to expand the access to this. And our data—we know we're going to continue to collect data. We knew that for all of our emergency use authorizations.
So, for example, remdesivir, which approves, approved—or authorized on May 1, we're still collecting data. And we will continue to do that with plasma as well.
So it's the nuances of the language around the authorization that we use and the legal aspects, too.
Q. So it's a promising treatment; it's not—you couldn't say it's very effective just yet?
Commissioner Hahn. So I would say that a 35—if you're one of those 35 out of 100 people who these data suggest or show survive as a result of it, this is pretty significant for that person and their family.
The President. Okay? This is a very big day. It's a day we've been looking forward to. Thank you very much. Great question. Thank you very much.
Q. Was there pressure on you, Dr. Hahn?"

So we called some people, wished them a very happy Labor Day, and they told us how they're doing, and we really celebrate the American worker. We are in the midst of the fastest economic recovery in U.S. history. So we have a lot to be thankful for, including this really beautiful day. It's why I thought we'd do this outside as opposed to in your more normal place.
The United States experienced the smallest contraction of any major Western nation. You probably know that. You look around and see how we're doing compared to every other nation, and our rise is spectacular. And we're rebounding much more quickly from the pandemic.
The U.S. economy added 1.4 million jobs last month, and we've have added a record-setting 10.6 million jobs since May—10.6 million jobs since May. That's a record that is not even close. Second place is a long ways away.
In July, the Congressional Budget Office was projecting unemployment over 10.5 percent through the end of 2020. So they thought 2020, and maybe it would be a lot longer than that. Some projections, where you'd go through the entire year, and that includes a lot of months in the following year, 2021. And instead, the unemployment rate plunged, really, to the surprise of many, all the way down to 8.4 percent in August. And that's the second largest single month decline on record. And we have the first; we have both of them. So we have the two number-one declines, ""decline"" meaning positive, not negative.
We're currently witnessing the fastest labor market recovery from an economic crisis in history—world history. By contrast, Biden presided over the worst, the weakest, and slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. It was the—it was a long, slow slog, and it was a very small—very small on growth and very small on every other factor that you need. It was the weakest recovery.
Under my leadership, next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country, I project. And some people are starting to agree. We have a ""V"" shape. It's probably a ""super V."" And you see what's going on with the stock market, where it's, in certain cases, already setting records. NASDAQ has set 17 records already, and this is as we're, hopefully, rounding the final turn in the pandemic.
First, we'll end the pandemic. Under Operation Warp Speed, we've pioneered groundbreaking therapies, reducing the fatality rate 85 percent since April. You don't hear that from the press very often. They don't like to talk about that. So the fatality rate, 85 percent—think of that—since April.
The United States has experienced among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world. And we are an absolute leader in every way. Under my leadership, we'll produce a vaccine in record time. Biden and his very liberal running mate—the most liberal person in Congress, by the way, who's not a competent person, in my opinion; would destroy this country and would destroy this economy—should immediately apologize for the reckless antivaccine rhetoric that they are talking right now, talking about endangering lives. And it undermines science. And what's happening is, all of a sudden, you'll have this incredible vaccine, and because of that fake rhetoric—it's a politic rhetoric; that's all it is. Just for politics. Because now they see we've done an incredible job, and in speed like nobody has ever seen before. This could have taken 2 or 3 years, and instead, it's going to be—[laughter]—it's going to be done in a very short of period of time. Could even have it during the month of October.
So, contrary to all of the lies, the vaccine that they're—they politicalize. They'll say anything. And it's so dangerous for our country, what they say. But the vaccine will be very safe and very effective, and it will be delivered very soon. You could have a very big surprise coming up. I'm sure you'll be very happy. But the people will be happy. The people of the world will be happy.
Next, we'll return to unprecedented prosperity through our pro-American policies. We'll pass new tax cuts to boost take-home pay. We're going to be cutting taxes very substantially. We get it back through growth. We had tremendous growth until we got hit with the China virus.
We'll continue our historic regulatory reduction campaign. We've—as you know, in 3½ years, we've cut more regulations than any other administration, no matter how long, no matter what period of time you're talking about. We'll enact fair trade deals, and we're working on seven major fair trade deals right now. And when I say ""fair,"" fair to our country—because our country was ripped off by every nation. Friend, foe, didn't matter: Every nation was ripping us off at a level that—it's just unbelievable, to be honest.
We're going to be expanding Opportunity Zones, and we will keep that going. It's been a tremendous—a tremendous—program. I want to thank Senator Scott, South Carolina, for coming up with that whole concept, because he came up, and I liked it right away, and it was—it's really turned out to be a tremendous thing, especially for African Americans, Hispanic Americans.
We'll continue to unleash American energy. We're number one in the world. And we're totally energy independent right now. And in 2021, we'll create 10 million jobs, at least, in the first 10 months.
Joe Biden and the radical, socialist Democrats would immediately collapse the economy. If they got in, they would collapse it. You'll have a crash the likes of which you've never seen before. Your stocks, your 401(k)s—remember, it's the people that own these massive, listed companies. A lot of people: rich people and not so rich people and middle-income people. And those stocks will crash like you've never seen before. The Biden plan begins with a $4 trillion tax hike. And that will end everything, including growth. There won't be growth. There will be total contraction.
Biden has also pledged to demolish the U.S. energy industry and implement the same policies causing blackouts in California. He wants to have things lit up with wind. He'll have to talk to China, Russia, India, and lots of other countries, because they're not doing that. And if they're not doing it, it puts us at a tremendous economic disadvantage, and it doesn't work.
You take a look at the blackouts in California; it's really rather amazing what's going on there. They've tried to go—and that's just with a small portion going that route. That doesn't work, and it can't fire up our big plants. If we're going to have this great industry that we've created—can't fire up our big plants.
Biden's plan for the China virus is to shut down the entire U.S. economy. He's going to totally rely on somebody to walk up, ""Yes, sir, it's time to shut it down."" He'd be laying off tens of millions of workers and causing countless deaths from suicide, substance abuse, depression, heart disease, and other very serious illnesses. Because when you do a shutdown, there's a problem on the other side; it's not just from the virus. You have a big problem with suicides, with losing your jobs, with all sorts of things that—you just take a look. Depression is a massive problem. And what happens is, you—they turn to substance abuse, alcohol, drugs. So we can't do that. And then, we'd have to give up all of the gains that I've been talking about over the last 3 months. We've—what we have done is incredible. We're setting records. All over the world, no matter where you go, nobody has done what we've been able to do.
So we're setting records in jobs. We're setting records in numbers. And you're going to see some very big numbers. Third-quarter numbers are coming out right before a very special day, November 3. So you have the numbers coming out, and they're, I think, going to be fantastic. You know, I think they're going to be fantastic.
The best numbers of all, if somebody doesn't come along and raise taxes—double, triple, quadruple your taxes—will be the numbers from next year. But you're going to have a good third-quarter number coming out. And I think it's going to be hard for even the media to disparage that number.
Biden wants to surrender our country to the virus, he wants to surrender our families to the violent left-wing mob, and he wants to surrender our jobs to China: our jobs and our economic well-being. I've taken in billions and billions of dollars from China. No other President has done what I've done. I've given much of it to the farmers. I've given it to farmers and manufacturers, but I've given most of it to the U.S. Treasury. Nobody has done that. We haven't taken in 10 cents from China ever.
They targeted our farmers, and I targeted them. And I gave $28 billion to our farmers. Our farmers wouldn't be existent right now. Right now they're very happy. In fact, they're setting records on purchases. China is purchasing more corn than they've ever done. Record purchase of corn and soybeans, beef, because they know I'm not happy with them. They know I'm not happy at all.
And frankly, I don't want to set the world necessarily to thinking too much about it right now, but there's been no country anywhere, at any time, that's ripped us off like China has. We lose billions and billions of dollars for years and years, decades. We've lost billions and billions and billions of dollars by dealing with China. We get nothing from China. They get nothing, other than loss, other than giving our money. And they take that money, and they build their military. And you see they're building up a powerful military. And it's very lucky that I've been building our up, because otherwise, we'd be dwarfed right now by China. We would be a terrible thing—a terrible thing.
We're way ahead on the nuclear front. We've upgraded our nuclear. Hope to God we never have to use it. But we would be in a position that we are not in right now. But China is spending the money we give them to build up their military. So when you mention the world ""decouple,"" it's an interesting word. So we lose billions of dollars, and if we didn't do business with them, we wouldn't lose billions of dollars. It's called ""decoupling."" So you'll start thinking about it. You'll start thinking.
They take our money, and they spend it on building airplanes and building ships and building rockets and missiles. And Biden has been just a pawn for them. He's been so easy. They dream about Biden. There was a report today that they hope that Joe Biden becomes President. If Joe Biden becomes President, China will own the United States, and every other country will be smiling also. They'll be smiling. When reports come out that certain countries don't really like me too much, that's not because of my personality, although it could be that also, frankly. It's because of the fact that I've been very tough on countries that have been ripping us off for so many years.
If you look at NATO, with the exception of eight countries—we're one of them—every country is way behind. They're delinquent, especially Germany, in paying their NATO bills. That means we end up paying it, and we're not doing it. I told them; we're not doing it. And they've increased their spending now $130 billion, going up to $400 billion a year. It's all because of me. Then, you hear the country doesn't like me. I mean, I can understand that, because President Obama and other Presidents, in all fairness, would go in there, and they'd make a speech, and they'd leave. I went in there, I looked, and I said: ""This is unfair. We're paying for NATO."" We're paying for NATO. Almost all of it.
So they rip us off on the military and then they rip us off, with the European Union, on trade. And Biden doesn't have a clue. You know he doesn't have a clue. Everybody knows he doesn't have a clue. In primetime, he wasn't good. And now it's not primetime.
He spent 47 years sending American jobs to China, to Mexico, and to other countries, while collecting millions of dollars in campaign and super PAC contributions from global corporations that got rich by making American workers poor.
His son, ""Where is Hunter?""—Where is Hunter?—I call him ""Where is Hunter?""—walked away with $1½ billion to manage, even though he never did that before. He walked away with a fortune from Ukraine, from China, and from other countries. Between his son and his brother, you ought to read the statements. And the press doesn't pick that up. If I ever did that, it would be—it would be hell, even worse than it's been. Okay? Even worse than it's been.
What he's done is so incredible. ""I won't give them the billion dollars,"" he says. ""I won't give them, unless they get rid of that Prosecutor."" And then, voilá, they got rid of the Prosecutor. And the press doesn't even want to talk about it. You talk about quid pro quo. With me, there was none. With him, he's right on tape, and you don't want to cover it. You should be ashamed of yourselves. The press should be ashamed of themselves.
But Biden shipped away our jobs, threw open our borders, and sent our youth to fight in these crazy endless wars. And it's one of the reasons the military—I'm not saying the military is in love with me; the soldiers are. The top people in the Pentagon probably aren't because they want to do nothing but fight wars so that all of those wonderful companies that make the bombs and make the planes and make everything else stay happy.
But we're getting out of the endless wars; you know how we're we doing. We defeated 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate—100 percent. When I was in—when I came in, it was a mess; it was all over. They have it, in a certain color, all ISIS. A year later, I said, ""Where is it?"" ""It's all gone, sir. Because of you, it's all gone,"" because of my philosophy. But all gone. And I said, ""That's good. Let's bring our soldiers back home. Some people don't like to come home. Some people like to continue to spend money."" One cold-hearted globalist betrayal after another, and that's what it was.
Biden supported NAFTA. He supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Two disasters. The most disastrous trade deals in history, both of them. I can't tell you which was worse; they were both terrible.
And as you know, I ended it, and I ended NAFTA. And we're looking at the World Trade Organization. They've become much better—I will say that. We—World Health, I got out of, because we're spending $500 million. China was spending $38 million, and China controlled it. But World Trade, we're looking at it. They've been very nice to us lately—I will say that—amazingly. We never used to win anything at the World Trade; would lose every case. Now, all of a sudden, we're winning a lot of cases. We just won $7 billion as a case. And they're talking to us much differently than they used to, because if they don't shape up, we're going to ship out. That's all. We're not treated fairly.
China is treated as a developing nation. Developing nation. We're treated as a nation that's fully developed. We're not fully developed, as far as I'm concerned—when you look around at Portland and you see what these Democrats are doing to our cities. Take a look at what's happening in New York and Chicago, where you have Democrat-run cities and mayors that are running, and Governors that are running States so badly, and mayors running cities so badly. It's very sad to look at it. It's Democrat-run, every one of them that I see. I guess we could probably find one or two that aren't. But I don't—so far, I haven't been able to.
If you look at Biden, he supported TPP, Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have been a disaster; it would have destroyed our automobile business. By the way, many plants are being built right now—auto plants—in Michigan, just like I said. They're being built in Ohio; they're being built in South Carolina, North Carolina. They're being built all over and expanded at a level that we've never seen before, because I said to Japan and Germany and others: ""Sorry, you've got to come here and build plants. Otherwise, we're going to have to make it very tough on you with tariffs.""
And we got out of the horrible Paris climate accord that he'll go back into, because, you know, it sounds wonderful. It's a disaster for this country. They've basically taken away your wealth, the Paris climate accord. And the other countries don't have to adhere to it. China doesn't kick in until 2030; they don't have to do anything until 2030. We had very high standards. We would have had to close, under some scenarios, 25 percent of our businesses in order to qualify under this ridiculous Paris climate accord. It sounds good. It was very bad and very expensive.
The New York Times has just published an entire story on Biden's China sell-outs, which is amazing for the New York Times. I appreciate that. In 2001, Biden said, ""The United States welcomes the emergence of a prosperous, integrated China on the global stage because we expect this is going to be a China that plays by the rules."" They didn't play by the rules. They didn't play by the rules.
The World Trade Organization, one of the reasons it's so bad is that China didn't play by the rules. We did. We did. But their rules were easier because they're considered a developing nation, so they had a much lower standard. But even that, they didn't play by the rules. That's when they became a rocket ship. They were flatlined for years and years and years. Then, they joined the World Trade Organization. And frankly, they cheated. Okay? They cheated. I'll say it. What difference does it make? I feel much differently. I feel I made a great trade deal with China. Great. And they're buying. You know why they're buying? Because they know I'm not happy. That's why they're buying. And I talk about it because today is Labor Day, and it's a good to time talk about when we're being ripped off by countries. But nobody is even close to China.
Biden cheered China's rise as a great power ""because great powers adhere to international norms in the areas of nonproliferation, human rights, and trade."" Well, they didn't. They took advantage of stupid people. Stupid people. And Biden is a stupid person. You know that. You're not going to write it. But you know that.
The cost of Biden's economic treachery was 60,000 shuttered American factories. And I heard this morning, the real number is probably 70,000—70,000 shuttered American factories. And he's talking about how wonderful it is with China. No, China has been very bad, on top of which we had the China plague sent to us and other viruses—nothing near this serious—but the swine, and we had other viruses sent in over the years that came from China. I wonder why. If Biden wins, China wins, because China will own this country. If Biden wins, China will own this country, and hopefully, you're not going to be able to find that out. It's the most important election in our history, right now. Most important election in our history.
Under my administration, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we'll end our reliance on China once and for all. Whether it's decoupling or putting in massive tariffs like I've been doing already, we're going to end our reliance on China, because we can't rely on China. And I don't want them building a military like they're building right now, and they're using our money to build it.
We'll manufacture our critical medical supplies in the United States. We'll create ""Made in America"" tax credits and bring our jobs back from China to the United States. And we'll impose tariffs on companies that desert America to create jobs in China and other countries. If they can't do it here, then let them pay a big tax to build it someplace else and send it into our country. We'll prohibit federal contracts from companies that outsource to China. And we'll hold China accountable for allowing the virus to spread around the world.
Now you can understand why China would much rather see Sleepy Joe than Donald Trump. But as long as I'm President, we will never waver in our undying loyalty to the American worker and to our country as a whole.
So happy Labor Day, everybody.
Yes. Go ahead.
Former Senator John S. McCain III/The President's Alleged Comments Regarding Fallen U.S. Servicemembers/The President's Canceled November 2018 Visit to Aisne-Marne American Cemetery in France/News Media 
Q. Thanks, Mr. President. The issue of what happened when you were in France continues to be a story.
The President. You're going to have to take that off, please. Just—you can take it off. Your health—how many feet are you away?
Q. I'll speak a lot louder.
The President. Well, if you don't take it off, you're very muffled. So if you would take it off, it would be a lot easier.
Q. Well, I'll just speak a lot louder. Is that better?
The President. It's better, yes. It's better.
Q. Mr. President, some people are having a hard time believing your denials of the Atlantic story because of what you said about John McCain in the past. Do you understand that? And have you asked John Kelly——
The President. No, I don't understand that.
Q. And have you asked John Kelly to refute that story?
The President. No, I don't understand it at all, no, because I've always been on the opposite side of John McCain. John McCain liked wars. I will be a better warrior than anybody, but when we fight a war, we're going to win them. And frankly, I was never a fan of John McCain. You know that; that's been very obvious. I was—but I had to approve his entire—his funeral. I wanted him to get—he deserved a first-class—you know, and it all was approved by me. We sent Air Force One to pick up the casket—a lot of things. But no, I was never a fan of John McCain, because he wanted the endless wars, and I didn't. I thought that the way the vets were taken care of—our great vets—was not good, not appropriate. And of course, he took the fake, dirty dossier and gave it over to the FBI. So this is not somebody—am I supposed to say, ""What a wonderful guy""?
So, you know what? I lived with him. He lived with me. But we had different philosophies. I think my philosophy is right. I think it's turned out to be right. But I wasn't a fan. But I respect people, and I respect a lot of people. That doesn't mean I necessarily have to agree with them, and I didn't agree with him on a lot of things.
The story is a hoax, written by a guy who has got a tremendously bad history. The magazine itself—which I don't read, but I hear it's just totally anti-Trump; he's a big Obama person, he's a big Clinton person. And he made up the story. It's a totally made-up story.
In fact, I was very happy to see Zach Fuentes came out and said now he's—that's—I think that's number 15—and these are people that were there. That's the 15th person. General Kellogg, everybody that was there knew what happened. And so I was happy to see that Zach came out and said it's not true. He just came out.
And it's a disgrace. Who would say a thing like that? Only an animal would say a thing like that. There is nobody that has more respect for not only our military, but for people that gave their lives in the military. There's nobody—and I think John Kelly knows that. I think he would know that. I think he knows that from me.
But Zach Fuentes, as you know, worked for John. And I think they both know that. But Zach came out, as you know, today or yesterday, last night, and said very strongly that he didn't hear anything like that. Even John Bolton came out and said that was untrue.
Now, what was true is that we had the worst weather. I think it was as bad a rain as I've just about ever seen. And it was a fog you—you literally couldn't see. I walked out, and I didn't have—I didn't need somebody to tell me. I walked out and I said, ""There's no way we can take helicopters in this."" I understand helicopters very well. And they said, ""No, sir, that's been canceled.""
They would have had to go—Secret Service, I have the whole list—they would have had through a very, very busy section, during the day, of Paris. They would have had to go through the city. The Paris police were asking us, ""Please don't do it,"" because they're not ready. When you do that, you need a lot of time. They take days and days and days to prepare for that.
I wanted to do it very badly. I was willing to sit in the car for 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours. I didn't care. It didn't matter. And I had nothing else to do. I went there for that; I had nothing else to do. It was ended because of the terrible weather, and nobody was prepared to go through, in terms of Paris, the police, the military, and the Secret Service. And they came out very strongly and said, ""Sir, we can't allow you to make this trip."" If I wanted to: ""Sir, we can't allow you, from a safety standpoint.""
It was a phony story, just like the dirty dossier—the fake, dirty dossier; just like the Russia collusion; just like all of the other phony stories. And there'll be more phony stories.
But I do appreciate Zach coming out. But Zach now is the 15th person that's denied it. Zach now, I think, also talked about the weather aspect of it. And he's probably the 14th or 15th person that blamed it on weather. So that's enough of that.
Yes, please.
Q. Mr. President——
Protests and Civil Unrest in U.S. Cities/Deployment of Federal Law Enforcement Officers to U.S Cities 
Q. Thank you, sir. Christina Bobb, One America News. Thank you for holding the briefing.
The President. Thank you.
Q. We're seeing judges, most recently in Detroit, limit police ability to use nonlethal force. My first question would be: Should the police be allowed to use nonlethal force to quell the violence in their cities?
The President. We're talking about where? Nonlethal force?
Q. Right. So, in the riots, most recently——
The President. The riots?
Q. Yes.
The President. Well, I think what's happened is the—the toughness. These are Democrat-run cities, all. And there's no retribution. There's no—they stand there, they throw things at the people that are supposed to be protecting something, and nothing happens. They throw rocks. They throw cans of soup. They throw lots of hard objects. And rarely does anything happen.
But I've told, when we have the Federal in there—as you know, I told the U.S. Marshals to go get the man who killed a—another man. And they know who it was, and you have to arrest him. You have to arrest him. After 2½ days, they didn't arrest him. The U.S. Marshals went in, and it ended up being a gunfight, and the man was killed. But this is a man that had a bad record, and this is a man that killed a man in the street. I mean, I witnessed it; most people witnessed it. And the U.S. Marshals went in; they weren't playing games. They can't play games. If somebody is breaking the law, there's got to be a form of retribution.
I watch—so often, when I watch some of the areas that we're talking about—now we have Rochester—that's, again, Democrat Governor, Democrat mayor. All Democrats, every one of them, and it always will be.
I was with the Governor in Texas; he looked at me and said, ""I can't imagine how they allow this to happen."" And you know, it's different. It's different. I could talk about other Governors saying the same thing.
Yes, please, go ahead.
Removal or Defacement of Monuments, Memorials, and Statues 
Q. If I could follow up on that. We're also hearing reports of groups like Antifa and Black Lives Matter traveling around the country, leaving their home cities to go riot and protest in other cities where they're causing damage.
The President. Yes.
Q. Do we expect to see prosecution or charges——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——from the Department of Justice for those traveling for that purpose?
The President. So we have now over a thousand people—Federal—in jail. We're prosecuting many people. A big thing was when I signed the law putting people in jail, if you knock down monuments. That was 3 months ago. There hasn't been a Federal monument knocked down in 3 months, or even thought about. I don't think they've even thought about it. So that's had a very big impact—a very big impact.
But yes, we're going around, and the nice part is, you people take—see those people up there?—they take nice pictures of everybody, so we don't even have to bother. We can use the news photos. We had a photo right over there of Andrew Jackson, the monument. He was getting ready, and this guy was a big, brave guy, and he was up like this, and he was showing off to all his friends. And he got arrested, and so did a lot of other people get arrested. And I would say we have the ultimate proof. Now, in that case, we got there before they ripped down the statue of Andrew Jackson, which is so beautiful, which is right over there. But they never got it.
But right after that, I signed an order saying you go to prison for 10 years. And as soon as I signed that order, that was the end of the statues coming down. But they have other ideas. They've got plenty of ideas. They're not at want for ideas.
Please, go ahead.
National Economy/Economic Stimulus Legislation 
Q. Mr. Spunt—David Spunt from Fox News. Mr. Trump—Mr. President, thank you for taking my question. Sir, you talked a lot about the economy and touted the economy. Three weeks ago, in Bedminster, I asked you specifically why you have not called Democratic leadership in the White House to meet with them. If they don't want to meet, it's on them.
A lot of people are criticizing you. I cover you on the weekends and stuff. You're——
The President. I don't think they are.
Q. ——doing a lot of golfing. Why have you not met with them in person?
The President. Yes.
Q. I mean, we're in September. There is no deal. There is no hope of a deal.
The President. ","I know. I know.
Q. We're 2 months out from the election. What do you say to——
The President. Don't say there's ""no hope."" Why do you say there's ""no hope""?
Q. But what can you say to the millions——
The President. What do you know?
Q. Well, what can you say—it doesn't seem——
The President. What do you know?
Q. It doesn't seem like there's hope, sir.
The President. And let me just tell you: I know my customers; that's what I do. I know Pelosi, I know Schumer very well. They don't want to make a deal, because they think it's good for politics if they don't make a deal. This has nothing to do with anything other than you have to know who you're dealing with. I do. These are people that I don't have a lot of respect. I don't think they have a lot of respect for the American people. And I know who I'm dealing with.
And I don't need to meet with them to be turned down. They don't want to make a deal, because they know that's good for the economy. And if they make a deal that's good for the economy, and therefore it's good for me for the election in November—November 3—and therefore, they're not going to make a deal. Now, if we gave the store away, if we bailed out all of their Democrat-run cities where we give them a trillion dollars, which is the kind of money they want—they want a trillion dollars to bail out badly run, Democrat cities and States. Whether it's New York or Illinois or others, they want to bail them out. And we're saying, ""Well, we're not going to pay that kind of a price in order to bail the cities out."" We'll do something to help cities, but that's going to have to rest on its own.
And why didn't you do this at the beginning? Because they could have done it at the beginning. So I know who I'm dealing with.
And I'm on the phone with Mnuchin and with Meadows and with all of these people constantly, you know, while they're there. But I also know when it's time to meet with people. I've done very well with deals, okay? That's what I do. And I know when it's time to meet. But I don't have to meet them in order to be turned down and in order for them to walk out to the sticks—which is the microphones—and give you people a false report of what just took place in the Oval Office.
So they don't want to make a deal because they think that if the country does as badly as possible, even though a lot of people are being hurt, that's good for the Democrats. But, David, that's a bad thing.
Yes, please. Go ahead.
Q. But as President, shouldn't you take the high road, sir?
The President. I am taking the high road. I'm taking the high road by not seeing them. That's the high road.
Yes.
Q. And you——
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. David——
The President. And if I thought it made a difference or would make a difference, I'd do it in a minute.
Yes. Go ahead.
2016 Donald J. Trump Presidential Campaign/Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act/Vote-by-Mail Policies/2020 Presidential Election 
Q. Yeah, David Jackson, USA Today. My question is about the Durham report, which you have talked about recently. You said, ""Let's see what happens."" Now, you've accused people of committing crimes against you during the Russia investigation——
The President. Yes. Sure. Sure.
Q. ——including President Obama and Joe Biden.
The President. They spied on my campaign. That's right.
Q. Because my question is——
The President. They spied on my campaign. And if they were Democrats, they would have been in jail 2 years ago. They would have been in jail—literally, if this side were the Democrat side, they would have been in jail 2 years ago for 50-year terms for treason and other things.
Q. But excuse me, my question is: Do you want the Justice Department to indict people over this? The President. I'm not going to say that. I have to see the report. I haven't seen—I purposely—I don't know if that was a good thing, smart thing. I don't know. But nobody can complain about it. I have every right to have been very much involved, and maybe someday I'll get involved in it.
They spied on my campaign, and that includes Biden and Obama. They spied on my campaign trying to defeat me. They wrote up a fake dossier that has proven to be totally fake—written by Christopher Steele, paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats—and they used that illegally in the FISA courts.
If we did what they did, you would have many people in jail all right—right now. And you have, other than the one agent that admitted his guilt that he forged documents—we don't have that yet, but the report hasn't been issued yet. Let's see what happens.
Q. It sure sounds like you want to prosecute people.
The President. But let me just—let me just tell you something: President Obama and Biden—Sleepy Joe, he knew everything that was happening. They were spying on my campaign, and they got caught. Now let's see what happens.
But if this were the opposite way, people would have been jailed. They would have been in jail already for a period of at least—it would have started 2 years ago, and it would have been 50 years for treason, because you can't do that. That's never—and nothing like that's ever happened before. Then, they created, at tremendous expense—the money they paid is tremendous; I'm sure you know the money that was paid, millions of dollars. They created a fake dossier—a fake dossier—proven to be, now, fake. Everyone—and they used it in the FISA courts. That's a crime.
Q. But it sure sounds like you want to prosecute——
The President. So far, I haven't seen anybody have a problem. But the report hasn't been issued yet. Let's see what happens with the Durham report.
But this started at Obama, and some people would say—and some people, ""Well, but he was President,"" like, ""Let's leave him alone."" If it were me, they wouldn't be leaving me alone, I can tell you. It's a totally double standard, and it's a disgrace.
And if I were a Republican Senator and if I were a Republican Congressman—and we have some great ones, but we have a lot of them that don't fight the way that the other side fights. We have much better policy. We have much better things going for us, like borders and walls and immigration and no sanctuary cities. And a lot—they have a lot of bad stuff going, but they're dirty fighters.
And the dirtiest fight of all is the issuance of 80 million ballots, unrequested. They're not requested; they're just sending 80 million ballots all over the country. Eighty million ballots, nonrequested. I call them ""unsolicited ballots."" That's going to be the dirtiest fight of all. People are going to get ballots; they're going to say, ""What am I doing?"" And then, they're going to harvest. They're going to do all the things.
And if you look at the last period of 6 months—take a look at the races where they've sent ballots out. Take a look at Carolyn Maloney, whose race should be redone because she won that race totally unfairly to her opponent. Her opponent did very well against her. That race should be rerun, but they declared her the winner, because they heard I found out about it. But take a look at what's happened in New Jersey and in Virginia, in different places. It's a disgrace. That will be a beauty.
Yes, please.
U.S. Postal Service Postmaster General and Chief Executive Officer Louis DeJoy 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. If proven true, are you okay with Postmaster General DeJoy and the fact that he asked former employees at his private company to make donations to the GOP and then reimburse them? Are you okay with that?
The President. Yes, I don't know too much about it. I read something this morning, but I don't—other than that, I'd have to see it. He's a very respected man. He was approved very much by both parties, I guess. It was sort of an approval that took place by both parties. I don't know exactly what the story is. I'll certainly know within a short period of time. I just read it for the first time—I read it this morning, just like you did.
Q. Would you support an investigation, sir?
The President. Sure. Sure.
Q. And in——
The President. I think let the investigations go. But he's a very respected man. Again, it was a bipartisan commission. Postmaster General is appointed by a bipartisan commission. And we'll see how that goes. But no, I think he's a very honest guy, but we'll see.
Yes.
Q. If he's proven to be a campaign——
Q. Thank you, Mr. President——
The President. Go ahead, please.
Q. Mr. President, just a follow-up, please, if you don't mind. If it's proven to be a campaign finance scheme, do you think he should lose his job?
The President. Yes. If something can be proven that he did something, always. You know?
Q. Thank you.
The President. Always. They've been looking at me for 4 years; they found nothing. Four years. Think of it: For 4 years—from the day I came down the escalator, I've been under investigation by sleaze, and they found nothing. They found nothing. A friend of mine said, ""You have to be the most innocent, honorable man ever to hold the office of President.""
Think of it: They spent—just Mueller alone, he spent—I guess the real number turned out to be $48 million, but whatever it was—many, many millions of dollars. They had 18 angry Democrats looking. They had FBI agents all over the place. They had every—and they have no collusion. Friends of mine have said—sophisticated friends have said, ""You've got to be the most innocent guy ever to hold this office."" And there's a lot of truth to that.
Yes, please.
Nord Stream 2 Natural Gas Pipeline/North Atlantic Treaty Organization/Defense Burden-Sharing 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. After Navalny poisoning, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is under pressure to cancel Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany. Would you support such a move?
The President. Sure.
Q. Do you think that the project should be canceled? The President. Sure. Well, I've been support—I've been supportive of that. I was the first one that brought it up. You never heard of Nord Stream 2 until Trump came along.
When I came along, I said: ""Wait a minute. We're protecting Germany from Russia, right?"" NATO. ""We're protecting Germany from Russia. Germany is paying Russia billions and billions of dollars to get their energy."" And the real number is, probably 60 to 70 percent, ultimately, of their energy is going to come from Russia. And I said this for years, that nobody talks about it. One of the many things, between sanctions and all of the—what we've done for Ukraine, relative to what the past—they used to send pillows, and we sent tank busters. But I brought that up a long time ago. Russia is unhappy that I brought it up. But you never heard of Nord Stream 2; nobody did, until I got elected.
And I said: ""Why is Germany making a deal to give billions of dollars to Russia, and then we're protecting Germany from Russia? How does that work?"" And then, on top of it, Germany is delinquent, because they're only paying a little more than 1 percent and they're supposed to be paying 2 percent, and even the 2 percent is low. But just remember: Trump—me—I got the countries of NATO to spend one point—$130 billion, going to $400 billion a year. Think of it: $400 billion a year more for NATO.
And the purpose of NATO primarily is Europe protection against Russia. Now, they can use it for other, I guess—and they have a little bit in the Middle East, et cetera, et cetera.
But I'm the one that did that. So—but nobody talks about that. Nobody talks about Nord Stream 2.
The answer is: Absolutely, if they feel that something happens. But I don't know that Germany is in a position right now, because Germany is in a very weakened position, energy wise. They're closing all their plants. They're closing their nuclear. They're closing their coal. They're closing a lot of plants. And they are—they have put themselves in a very bad position, frankly. Very, very bad position.
Yes, please.
News Media/Former Chief of Staff John F. Kelly 
Q. Mr. President, can I follow up Jeff Mason's [Jeff Mason, Reuters] question? Have you asked John Kelly to publicly refute the Atlantic? And then, can I ask something else?
The President. No, I have nothing against John. I have nothing against anybody. No.
I was very heartened to see that a friend of his—because I know Zach is a friend of his and worked for him—I was very heartened to see that Zach Fuentes came out with the statement that he did—I guess, late last night—that it was not true.
Office of Management and Budget Guidance on Federal Employee Training Restrictions 
Q. Can I ask another question, sir, on a different topic, Mr. President? Mr. President, what exactly is un-American about Federal Government training programs that are aimed at improving inclusivity or pointing out biases?
The President. Well, we're going to do a report. Yes, I fired those people; they're all gone. And it was a disgrace, frankly. And we're going to give you a big report that's going to make you very happy.
All right, yes, please.
Coronavirus Vaccine and Treatment Development
Q. Thank you. Darlene Superville, AP. You said a moment ago, ""They'll say anything."" You were talking about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and their comments about the vaccine. You have asserted——
The President. No, they say worse; they say negative. They say negative. They're going to make the vaccine into a negative so that when we have it—and I spoke to the head of Pfizer, I spoke to the head of Johnson and Johnson, I spoke to the heads of the greatest medical companies in the world. We're doing great. We're going to have it soon.
Q. Right——
The President. Wait a minute. So now what they're saying is: ""Oh, wow, this is bad news. President Trump is getting this vaccine in record time."" By the way, if this were the Obama administration, you wouldn't have that vaccine for 3 years, and you probably wouldn't have it all.
So we're going to have a vaccine very soon, maybe even before a very special date. You know what date I'm talking about.
Q. Yes.
The President. But let me just tell you—wait. And what they're doing, because they think it is going fast. And if you talk to a lot of your sources—if you have sources—if you talk to your sources in the FDA, you'll see it's going very, very well. The numbers are looking unbelievably strong, unbelievably good.
So now they're saying: ""Wow, Trump has pulled this off. Okay, let's disparage the vaccine."" That's so bad for this country. That's so bad for the world to even say that. And that's what they're saying.
But I watched Kamala's poll numbers drop from 15 to almost zero and then drop out even before she ran in Iowa because people didn't like her, and I understand why. She will never be President—although I have to be careful, because Obama used to say that about me. So I have to be a little bit careful.
Q. Right, but——
The President. But you have to look at her a little bit more closely, because obviously Joe is not doing too well. So you're going to have to look at her a little bit too closely.
But she's talking about disparaging a vaccine so that people don't think the achievement was a great achievement. I don't want the achievement for myself, I want something that's going to make people better, that people aren't going to get sick with. That includes therapeutics, where we're doing equally as well. Therapeutics.
Q. May I finish? May I finish the question?
The President. Go ahead.
Q. Your point is that: What they're saying is that they're saying it for a political purposes.
The President. Yes.
Q. You have asserted repeatedly that a vaccine will be on the market by—before the election, by the end of October.
The President. No, I didn't say—I didn't say ""they will."" I said, ""By the end of the year.""
Q. Aren't you doing the same thing that you——
The President. No, but you're not quoting me accurately.
Q. ——say they're guilty of?
The President. I said that vaccines will be on the market before the end of year, but they may even be on the market—they may even be developed and fully developed, tested, and everything else.
You know, we have 30,000 people, in just one vaccine right now, under test in very, very highly infected areas. So we're going to be able to get a good result, one way or the other, very soon.
So I didn't say what you said. What I said is ""by the end of the year."" But I think it could even be sooner than that. It could be during the month of October, actually. Could be before November.
Q. But aren't you also saying that for political reasons?
The President. No, I'm saying that because we want to save a lot of lives. The fast—with me, it's the faster, the better. With somebody else, maybe they would say it politically, but I'm saying it in terms of this is what we need. We have to have—if get the vaccine early, that's a great thing, whether it's politics or not.
Now, do benefits inure if you're able to get something years ahead of schedule? I guess, maybe they do. But the most important thing to me is saving lives; it's the most important thing.
Yes, go ahead. In the back.
1619 Project/Washington Monument 
Q. Hi. Just based on some of your recent tweets, sir, do you——
The President. You sound so clear—[laughter]—as opposed to everybody else, where they refuse.
Q. Your tweets about the 1619 Project——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——why do you object to that being taught in schools? And do you object to slavery itself being taught in schools?
The President. Yes, so—no, I want everybody to know everything they can about our history. I'm not a believer in cancel culture, the good or the bad. If you don't study the bad, it could happen again. So I do want that subject studied very, very carefully and very accurately.
But we grew up with a certain history, and now they're trying to change our history—revisionist history. That's why they want to take down our monuments. That's why they want to take down our statues.
I saw something the other day, which was absolutely horrendous: Washington Monument, they want to rename it—the DC committee, but the DC committee is all Democrats. Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson—I mean, we're talking about—this is the big stuff now. This is the big stuff. And they want to rename it. They want to redesignate it. They want to take some down. No, we don't do that. Never going to happen with me, I guarantee you that.
Well, I want to thank you all, and I just want to wish you a very happy Labor Day. And we're having tremendous success, whether it's on the vaccines, whether it's on the pandemic—the plague that came in from China, that China should have never let happen, because I will never feel the same about China.
Q. Can I ask a question on the vaccine?
The President. And I just want to again wish you a happy Labor Day.
Thank you very much, everybody."
"March 25, 2021",The President's News Conference,Joseph R. Biden,"Joseph R. Biden, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/348960",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1268,"The President. Please, please sit down. Thank you. Thank you. Good afternoon. Before I take questions, I want to make—give you a progress report to the Nation on where we stand 65 days into office here on vaccinations and a few other top priorities for the American people.
First, on vaccinations: On December 8, I indicated that I hoped to get 100 million shots in people's arms in my first 100 days. We met that goal last week by day 58, 42 days ahead of schedule.
Now, today I'm setting a second goal, and that is: We will, by my 100th day in office, have administered 200 million shots in people's arms. That's right: 200 million shots in 100 days. I know it's ambitious, twice our original goal, but no other country in the world has even come close—not even close—to what we are doing. And I believe we can do it.
And today, we've made a historic investment in reaching the hardest hit and the most vulnerable communities, the highest risk communities—as a consequence of the virus—by investing an addition $10 billion in being able to reach them.
I also set a goal, before I took office, of getting a majority of schools in K through 8 fully open in the first 100 days. Now, thanks to the enormous amount of work done by our administration, educators, parents, local, State education officials and leaders, a recent Department of Education Department survey shows that nearly half of the K-through-8 schools are open now full time, 5 days a week, for in-person learning. Not yet a majority, but we're really close. And I believe, in the 35 days left to go, we'll meet that goal as well.
As of yesterday, more than 100 million payments of $1,400 have gone into people's bank accounts. That's real money in people's pockets, bringing relief instantly, almost. And millions more will be getting their money very soon.
One final note: Since we passed the American Rescue Plan, we're starting to see new signs of hope in our economy. Since it was passed, a majority—a majority—of economic forecasters have significantly increased their projections on the economic growth that's going to take place this year. They're now projecting it will exceed 6 percent, a 6-percent growth in GDP.
And just this morning we learned that the number of people filing for weekly unemployment insurance fell by nearly 100,000 persons. That's the first time in a year the number has fallen below the prepandemic high. So there are still too many Americans out of work, too many families hurting, and we still have a lot of work to do.
But I can say to you, the American people: Help is here, and hope is on the way.
Now I'll be happy to take your questions.
Zeke [Zeke Miller], the Associated Press.
Coronavirus Containment Efforts/Economic Concerns/The President's Agenda 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned your progress on COVID-19. I'd like to ask you about some of the other issues facing your Presidency. One of the defining challenges you face in the coming months is how to deliver on your promise to Americans on issues like immigration reform, gun control, voting rights, climate change. All of those right now are facing stiff, united opposition from Republicans on Capitol Hill. How far are you willing to go to achieve those promises that you made to the American people?
The President. Well, I'm going to—look, when I took office, I decided that it was a fairly basic, simple proposition, and that is: I got elected to solve problems. And the most urgent problem facing the American people, I stated from the outset, was COVID-19 and the economic dislocation for millions and millions of Americans. And so that's why I put all my focus in the beginning—there are a lot of problems—put all my focus on dealing with those particular problems.
And the other problems we're talking about, from immigration to guns and the other things you mentioned, are long-term problems; they've been around a long time. And what we're going to be able to do, God willing, is now begin, one at a time, to focus on those as well, and—whether it's immigration or guns or a number of other problems that face the country.
But the fundamental problem is getting people some peace of mind so they can go to bed at night and not stare at the ceiling wondering whether they lost their health insurance, whether they're going to lose a family member, whether they're going to be in a position where they're not going to be—they're going to lose their home because they can't pay their mortgage, or that millions of people are going to get thrown out of their homes because of the inability to pay their rent.
So we're going to move on these one at a time, try to do as many simultaneously as we can. But that's the reason why I focused as I have.
And here's the deal: I think my Republican colleagues are going to have to determine whether or not we want to work together, or they decide that the way in which they want to proceed is to just decide to divide the country, continue the politics of division. But I'm not going to do that; I'm just going to move forward and take these things as they come.
Economic Stimulus and Pandemic Relief Legislation 
Q. And just to follow up, Mr. President, can your Presidency be a success if you can't make progress on those four challenges: climate change, immigration reform, gun control, voting rights?
The President. Well, I plan on making progress on all of them, but that's going to be for the American people to decide.
I think—you know, I doubt whether—maybe you did; maybe others did. I thought—many of you thought there was no possibility of my getting the plan I got passed, passed, without any Republican votes. A pretty big deal. It got passed. Growing the economy. People's lives are changing.
So let's see what happens. All I know, I've been hired to solve problems—to solve problems, not create division.
Okay. How about Yamiche [Yamiche Alcindor, PBS News]?
Annual Immigration Patterns/Detention of Migrants at the Mexico-U.S. Border 
Q. Thanks so much, Mr. President. You've said over and over again that immigrants shouldn't come to this country right now; this isn't the time to come. That message is not being received. Instead, the perception of you—that got you elected—as a moral, decent man is the reason why a lot of immigrants are coming to this country and entrusting you with unaccompanied minors.
How do you resolve that tension? And how are you choosing which families can stay and which can go, given the fact that even though, with title 42, there are some families that are staying? And is there a timeline for when we won't be seeing these overcrowded facilities with—run by CPB [CBP],* when it comes to unaccompanied minors?
The President. Well, look, I guess I should be flattered people are coming because I'm the nice guy; that's the reason why it's happening—that I'm a decent man or however it's phrased. That—you know, that's why they're coming, because, you know, Biden is a good guy.
The truth of the matter is: Nothing has changed. As many people came—28-percent increase in children to the border in my administration; 31 percent in the last year of—in 2019, before the pandemic, in the Trump administration. It happens every single, solitary year: There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March. That happens every year.
In addition to that, there is a—and nobody—and by the way, does anybody suggest that there was a 31-percent increase under Trump because he was a nice guy and he was doing good things at the border? That's not the reason they're coming.
The reason they're coming is that it's the time they can travel with the least likelihood of dying on the way because of the heat in the desert, number one. Number two, they're coming because of the circumstances in-country—in-country.
The way to deal with this problem—and I started to deal with it back when I was a United States Senator—I mean, Vice President—putting together a bipartisan plan of over $700 million to deal with the root causes of why people are leaving.
What did Trump do? He eliminated that funding. He didn't use it. He didn't do it. And in addition to that, what he did—he dismantled all the elements that exist to deal with what had been a problem and—and has been—continued to be a problem for a long time. He, in fact, shut down the number of beds available. He did not fund HHS to get people to get the children out of those Border Patrol facilities where they should not be and not supposed to be more than a few days, a little while. But he dismantled all of that.
And so what we're doing now is attempting to rebuild—rebuild the system that can accommodate the—what is happening today. And I like to think it's because I'm a nice guy, but it's not. It's because of what's happened every year.
Let me say one other thing on this. If you take a look at the number of people who are coming, the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of people coming to the border and crossing are being sent back—are being sent back. Thousands—tens of thousands of people who are—who are over the 18 years of age and single—people, one at a time coming, have been sent back, sent home.
We're sending back the vast majority of the families that are coming. We're trying to work out now, with Mexico, their willingness to take more of those families back. But we're—that's what's happening. They're not getting across the border.
And those who are coming across the border, who are unaccompanied children, we're moving rapidly to try to put in place what was dismantled, as I said. For example, of all the children who are coming across the border, over 70 percent are either 16 or 17 years old. We're not talking about people ripping babies from mothers' arms or little 3-year-olds standing on the border. Less than—I think it's 1½ percent fall in the category of the very young. So what we're doing is, we're providing for the space, again, to be able to get these kids out of the Border Patrol facilities, which no child—no one should be in any longer than 72 hours.
And today, I went to—for example, I used all the resources available to me, went to the Defense Department, and—and the Secretary of Defense has just made available Fort Bliss—5,000 beds be made easily available. Five thousand beds on the Texas border.
So we're building back up the capacity that should have been maintained and built upon that Trump dismantled. It's going to take time.
And the other thing we're doing, I might add—am I giving you too long an answer? Because if you don't want the details——
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. No, no, but I mean—I don't know how much detail you want about immigration. Maybe I'll stop there, and finish——
Illegal Immigration/Unaccompanied Minors at the Mexico-U.S. Border 
Q. I just want to—my follow-up question is: One, if you could talk a little bit about which families—why they're being allowed to stay. What—the families that are being allowed to stay, why they're being allowed to stay.
And in addition to that, when it comes to the filibuster, which is what Zeke was asking about, there's—immigration is a big issue, of course, when it—related to the filibuster, but there's also Republicans who are passing bill after bill, trying to restrict voting rights. Chuck Schumer is calling it an ""existential threat"" to democracy. Why not back a filibuster rule that at least gets around issues including voting rights or immigration?
Jim Clyburn, someone who—of course, who you know very well, has backed the idea of a filibuster rule when it comes to civil rights and voting rights.
The President. Well, look, I'm going to deal with all of those problems. The question is, the priorities as they come and land on my plate.
Let's go to the first question you asked—the first of the second questions you asked. And that is: What about dealing with families? Why are not—some not going back? Because Mexico is refusing to take them back. They're saying they won't take them back, not all of them.
We're in negotiations with the President of Mexico. I think we're going to see that change. They should all be going back, all be going back. The only people we're not going to let sitting there on the other side of the Rio Grande by themselves with no help are children.
And what we're doing there, and it's an important point to understand—I know you understand; I don't mean to say it that way—an important point to focus on: The vast majority of people under the age of 18 coming to United States come with a telephone number on a wristband or come with a telephone number in their pocket in the United States—a mother, a father, a close relative, a grandmom or a grandpop.
Well, what was happening before is, it was taking literally weeks and weeks, and maybe even months, before anybody would pick up the phone and call to see if there really was someone there. Well, we've set up a system now where, within 24 hours, there's a phone call made as that person or that child crosses the border. And then, a verification system is being put in place as of today to determine quickly whether or not that is a trafficker being called or that is actually a mom, a dad, and/or a close relative. They're establishing that right off the bat.
If it, in fact, is mom or dad, dad says—to take the extreme case—""I've got a birth certificate."" Then guess what? We're getting that kid directly to that parent immediately.
And so that's going to reduce significantly—there's two ways to reduce child populations in circumstances that are not acceptable, like being held at a Border Patrol station. One is to get them to the place where they have a relative and set a date as to when a hearing can be held. The second way to do it is put them in a Health and Human Services facility that we're occupying now—both licensed beds around the country that exist, as well as, for example, Federal resources like Fort Bliss—to get them safely in a place where they can be taken care of while their fate is determined.
Use of the Filibuster in the Senate 
Q. And can you answer the filibuster—[inaudible]?
The President. Filibuster. Filibuster. You know, with regard to the filibuster, I believe we should go back to a position on the filibuster that existed just when I came to the United States Senate 120 years ago. And that is that—it used to be required for the filibuster—and I had a card on this; I was going to give you the statistics, but you probably know them—that it used to be that the—that from between 1917 to 1971—the filibuster existed—there were a total of 58 motions to break a filibuster that whole time. Last year alone, there were five times that many. So it's being abused in a gigantic way.
And, for example, it used to be you had to stand there and talk and talk and talk and talk until you collapsed. And guess what? People got tired of talking and tired of collapsing. Filibusters broke down, and we were able to break the filibuster, get a quorum, and vote.
So I strongly support moving in that direction, in addition to having an open mind about dealing with certain things that are—are just elemental to the functioning of our democracy, like the right to vote—like the basic right to vote. We've amended the filibuster in the past.
But here's the deal: As you observed, I'm a fairly practical guy. I want to get things done. I want to get them done, consistent with what we promised the American people. And in order to do that in a 50/50 Senate, we've got to get to the place where I get 50 votes so that the Vice President of the United States can break the tie, or I get 51 votes without her.
And so I'm going to say something outrageous: I have never been particularly poor at calculating how to get things done in the United States Senate. So the best way to get something done, if you hold near and dear to you that you like to be able to—anyway—I—we're going to get a lot done. And if we have to—if there's complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster, then we'll have to go beyond what I'm talking about.
Q. Thank you.
The President. Okay. Hang on. Sorry. Oh, Seung Min—Ms. Kim [Seung Min Kim, Washington Post].
Use of the Filibuster in the Senate 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President, to follow up on the filibuster: So do you believe it should take 60 votes to end a filibuster on legislation or 51?
The President. [Laughter] If we could end it with 51, we would have no problem. You're going to have to—the existing rule—it's going to be hard to get a parliamentary ruling that allows 50 votes to end the filibuster, the existence of a filibuster.
But it's not my expertise, in what the parliamentary rules and how to get there are. But our preoccupation with the filibuster is totally legitimate, but in the meantime, we've got a lot we can do while we're talking about what we're going to do about the filibuster.
Let me get here. Okay, Cecilia Vega [Cecilia Vega, ABC News].
Conditions in Central America/Unaccompanied Minors at the Mexico-U.S. Border/Addressing the Root Causes of Migration 
Q. I'd like to circle back to immigration, please. You just listed the reasons that people are coming, talking about in-country problems, saying that it happens every year; you blamed the last administration. Sir, I just got back last night from a reporting trip to the border where I met nine-year-old Yossell, who walked here from Honduras by himself, along with another little boy. He had that phone number on him——
The President. Astounding.
Q. ——and we were able to call his family. His mother says that she sent her son to this country because she believes that you are not deporting unaccompanied minors like her son. That's why she sent him alone from Honduras.
So, sir, you blamed the last administration, but is your messaging—in saying that these children are and will be allowed to stay in this country and work their way through this process—encouraging families like Yossell's to come?
The President. Well, look, the idea that I'm going to say—which I would never do—""if an unaccompanied child ends up at the border, we're just going to let him starve to death and stay on the other side""—no previous administration did that either, except Trump. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it.
That's why I've asked the Vice President of the United States, yesterday, to be the lead person on dealing with focusing on the fundamental reasons why people leave Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador in the first place. It's because of earthquakes, floods. It's because of lack of food. It's because of gang violence. It's because of a whole range of things.
That—when I was Vice President and had the same obligation to deal with unaccompanied children, I was able to get it slowed up significantly by working with the heads of state of those communities to do things like—in one of the major cities, the reason people were leaving is, they couldn't walk in the street because they were getting—their kids were getting beat up or shot or in gang violence.
Well, what I was able to do is not give money to the head of state, because so many are corrupt, but I was able to say: ""Okay, you need lighting in the streets to change things? I'll put the lighting in."" We've got a contractor. We've got the type of lighting. We paid directly to the contractor; it did not go through the Government. And violent crime significantly was reduced in that city. Fewer people sought to leave.
When this hurricane occurred—two hurricanes—instead of us going down and helping in a major way so that people would not have reason to want to leave in the first place because they didn't have housing or water or sustenance, we did nothing. We're going to do a lot in our administration. We're going to be spending that 700-plus million dollars a year to change the life and circumstances of why people leave in the first place.
That mother did not sit around with—on the kitchen table and say: ""You know, I've got a great idea: The way I'm going to make sure my son get taken care of is, I'm going to put a""—how old was he, or she?
Q. He's nine. I also met a 10-year-old.
The President. A 9-year-old. ""I'm going to send him on a thousand-mile journey across the desert and up to the United States because I know Joe Biden is a nice guy, and he'll take care of him.""
What a desperate act to have to take. The circumstances must be horrible. So we can do something about that. That's what the Vice President is going to be doing: what I did. When President Obama asked me to come and deal, I was in Turkey at the time, and he said, ""You've got to come home and take care of this."" So we put together a plan, and it had an impact.
And so, the question here is whether—how we go ahead and do this; what we do. There's no easy answer.
Q. A quick follow, if I may. Do you want to see these unaccompanied minors staying in this country, or should they be deported eventually?
The President. Well, the judgment has to be made whether or not—and in this young man's case, he has a mom at home; there's an overwhelming reason why he'd be put in a plane and flown back to his mom.
Detention Conditions at the Mexico-U.S. Border 
Q. Final follow, sir. [Laughter] You mentioned circumstances that must be horrific. The Customs and Border Protection facility in Donna, Texas—I was there—is at 1,556-percent capacity——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——right now, with mostly unaccompanied minors. There are kids that are sleeping on floors. They are packed into these pods. I've spoken to lawyers who say that they—some of these children have not seen the sun in days. What's your reaction—what is your reaction to these images that have come out from that particular facility? Is what's happening inside acceptable to you? And when is this going to be fixed?
The President. Is—that's a serious question, right?
Is it acceptable to me? Come on. That's why we're going to be moving a thousand of those kids out quickly. That's why I got Fort Bliss opened up. That's why I've been working from the moment this started to happen to try to find additional access for children to be able to safely—not just children, but particularly children—to be able to safely be housed while we follow through on the rest of what's happening.
That is totally unacceptable.
Ken [Ken Thomas, Wall Street Journal].
Withdrawal of U.S. Military Forces From Afghanistan 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you about Afghanistan. You face a May 1 deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from that country. As a candidate, in Foreign Affairs, you wrote that it is past time to end these forever wars. Can you commit to the American people that by May 2 the U.S. will no longer have forces in Afghanistan?
The President. The answer is that it's going to be hard to meet the May 1 deadline. Just in terms of tactical reasons, it's hard to get those troops out. So what we've been doing—what I've been doing and what Secretary Blinken has been doing—has been—we've been meeting with our allies, those other nations that have—NATO allies who have troops in Afghanistan as well. And if we leave, we're going to do so in a safe and orderly way.
We're in consultation, I said, with our allies and partners in how to proceed. And Secretary Blinken is meeting in Brussels this week with our NATO allies, particularly those who have forces there.
And General Austin is—just met with Kayani [Ghani]* and I'm waiting for the briefing on that. He is the ""leader,"" quote, in Afghanistan and Kabul. And there's a U.N.-led process that's beginning shortly on how to mechanically get people—how to end this war.
But it is not my intention to stay there for a long time. But the question is: How and in what circumstances do we meet that agreement that was made by President Trump to leave under a deal that looks like it's not being able to be worked out to begin with? How is that done? But we are not staying a long time.
Q. You just said ""if we leave."" Do you think it's possible that we——
The President. We will leave. The question is when we leave.
Q. Do you—sorry—do you believe, though, it's possible we could have troops there next year?
The President. I can't picture that being the case.
Q. Thanks.
The President. Okay, Kristen [Kristen Welker, NBC News].
Detention Conditions at the Mexico-U.S. Border/News Media Accessibility 
Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Given the conditions that were just laid out at the migrant facilities at the U.S. border, will you commit to allowing journalists to have access to the facilities that are overcrowded moving forward?
The President. I will commit when my plan, very shortly, is underway to let you have access to not just them, but to other facilities as well.
Q. How soon will journalists be able to have access to the facilities? We've obviously been allowed to be inside one, but we haven't seen the facilities in which children are packed together to really give the American people a chance to see that. Will you commit to transparency on this issue, Mr. President?
The President. I will commit to transparency and as soon as I am in a position to be able to implement what we are doing right now.
And one of the reasons I haven't gone down—I have all my—my chief folks have gone down—is I don't want to become the issue. I don't want to be, you know, bringing all of the Secret Service and everybody with me to get in the way. So this is being set up, and you'll have full access to everything once we get this thing moving.
Q. Okay. And just to be clear: How soon will that be, Mr. President?
The President. I don't know, to be clear.
The President's Immigration Policy 
Q. Okay. And do you bear responsibility for everything that's happening at the border now? I hear you talking a lot about the past administration. You decided to roll back some of those policies, did you move too quickly to roll back—[inaudible]—policies?
The President. To roll back what? I'm sorry.
Q. Did you move too quickly to roll back some of the Executive orders of your predecessor?
The President. First of all, all the policies that were underway were not helping at all—did not slow up the amount of immigration—and there's many people coming.
And rolling back the policies of separating children from their mothers, I make no apology for that. Rolling back the policies of ""Remain in Mexico,"" sitting on the edge of the Rio Grande in a muddy circumstance with not enough to eat and—I make no apologies for that.
I make no apologies for ending programs that did not exist before Trump became President that have an incredibly negative impact on the law, international law, as well as on human dignity. And so I make no apologies for that.
Short-Range Missile Tests in North Korea/International Diplomatic Efforts 
Q. If I could just ask you about foreign policy, Mr. President. Overnight, we learned that North Korea tested two ballistic missiles. What, if any, actions will you take? And what is your red line on North Korea?
The President. Let me say that, number one, U.N. Resolution 1718 was violated by those particular missiles that were tested—number one. We're consulting with our allies and partners. And there will be responses—if they choose to escalate, we will respond accordingly.
But I'm also prepared for some form of diplomacy, but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearization. So that's what we're doing right now: consulting with our allies.
Q. Just a very quick follow-up——
The President. You've only got another hour now, okay? [Laughter]
Q. Diplomacy: Can you define what you mean? And former President Obama warned the incoming President Trump that North Korea was the top foreign policy issue that he was watching. Is that how you assess the crisis in North Korea?
The President. Yes.
Okay. Hang on a second here. Kristen.
Nancy [Nancy Cordes, CBS News], CBS.
Voting Rights Restrictions 
Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I want to go back to voting rights. And as Yamiche mentioned, Republican legislatures across the country are working to pass bills that would restrict voting, particularly, Democrats fear, impacting minority voters and young voters—the very people who helped to get you elected in November.
Are you worried that if you don't manage to pass voting rights legislation that your party is going to lose seats and possibly lose control of the House and the Senate in 2022?
The President. What I'm worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It's sick. It's sick. Deciding in some States that you cannot bring water to people standing in line, waiting to vote; deciding that you're going to end voting at 5 o'clock when working people are just getting off work; deciding that there will be no absentee ballots under the most rigid circumstances.
It's all designed—and I'm going to spend my time doing three things: One, trying to figure out how to pass the legislation passed by the House, number one. Number two, educating the American public. The Republican voters I know find this despicable. Republican voters, the folks out in the—outside this White House. I'm not talking about the elected officials; I'm talking about voters. Voters.
And so I am convinced that we'll be able to stop this because it is the most pernicious thing. This makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle. I mean, this is gigantic what they're trying to do, and it cannot be sustained. I'm going to do everything in my power, along with my friends in the House and the Senate, to keep that from becoming the law.
Q. Is there anything else you can do about it besides passing legislation?
The President. The answer is ""yes,"" but I'm not going to lay out a strategy in front of the whole world and you now.
2024 Presidential Election 
Q. And then, on a related note, have you decided whether you are going to run for reelection in 2024? You haven't set up a reelection campaign yet, as your predecessor had by this time.
The President. [Laughter] My predecessor needed to. [Laughter] My predecessor. O","h God, I miss him. [Laughter]
Q. Have you—have you——
The President. No, the answer is ""yes."" My plan is to run for reelection. That's my expectation.
Bipartisanship/Senate Minority Leader A. Mitchell McConnell 
Q. And then, on—on one other note, on bipartisanship: Your old friend, Mitch McConnell, says you have only spoken to each other once since you took office and that you have moved far left since taking office. Do you see it the same way he does? Have you rejected bipartisanship?
The President. No, I haven't at all. I've been meeting—when is the last time a President invited the opposite party down at least a half a dozen times to talk about issues? Everything from how we work—we're working with a group of 20 Members of the Senate right now and House on how we reestablish our ability to make computer chips and how we get ahead of the game, how we can work together. And we're working together on a bunch of things.
But look, I know Mitch well; Mitch knows me well. I would expect Mitch to say exactly what he said. But this is a matter of making sure that—I would like Republican—elected Republican support, but what I know I have now is that I have electoral support from Republican voters. Republican voters agree with what I'm doing.
And so, unless Mitch says the last thing I did is—the last piece of legislation is so far left—well, then he ought to a look at his party. Over 50 percent of them must be over that edge as well because they support what I did.
Okay. Where am I here? Let me see.
Kaitlan [Kaitlan Collins, CNN News].
Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have a question for you, but first I'd like to follow up on a question from Yamiche, and that's on the filibuster.
The President. That counts as a question, but go ahead.
Q. Okay. I'll make it quick. It's a quick question.
The President. No, no—you can.
Use of the Filibuster in the Senate 
Q. Regarding the filibuster: At John Lewis's funeral, President Barack Obama said he believed the filibuster was a ""relic"" of the Jim Crow era. Do you agree?
The President. Yes.
Q. And if not, why not abolish it if it's a relic of the Jim Crow era?
The President. Successful electoral politics is the art of the possible. Let's figure out how we can get this done and move in the direction of significantly changing the abuse of even the filibuster rule first. It's been abused from the time it came into being—by an extreme way in the last 20 years. Let's deal with the abuse first.
Q. It sounds like you're moving closer to eliminating the filibuster. Is that correct?
The President. I answered your question.
2024 Presidential Election/Tax Code Reform/Deficit Spending/The President's Agenda 
Q. You also just made some news by saying that you are going to run for reelection.
The President. I said, ""That is my expectation.""
Q. So is that a ""yes"" that you are running for reelection?
The President. Look, I don't know where you guys come from, man. I've never been able to travel. I'm a great respecter of fate. I've never been able to plan 4½, 3½ years ahead for certain.
Q. And if you do——
The President. It——
Q. If you do run, will Vice President Harris be on your ticket?
The President. I would fully expect that to be the case. She's doing a great job. She's a great partner. She's a great partner.
Q. And do you believe you'll be running against former President Trump?
The President. Oh, come on. I don't even think about—I don't—I have no idea. I have no idea if there will be a Republican Party. Do you? I know you don't have to answer my question, but I mean, you know, do you?
I mean, look, this is—the way I view things—I've become a great respecter of fate in my life. I set a goal that's in front of me to get things done for the people I care most about, which are hard-working, decent American people who are getting—really having it stuck to them.
I want to change the paradigm. I want to change the paradigm. We start to reward work, not just wealth. I want to change the paradigm.
If you notice—don't you find it kind of interesting that my Republican friends were worried about that the cost and the taxes that had to be had—if there is any tax to be had, as they talk about it—in dealing with the—the act that we just passed which puts money in people's pockets—ordinary people.
Did you hear them complain when they passed close to a $2 trillion Trump tax cut, 83 percent going to the top 1 percent? Did you hear them talk about that all? I love the fact that they've found this whole idea of concern about the Federal budget. It's kind of amazing.
When the Federal budget is saving people's lives, they don't think it's such a good idea. When the Federal budget is feathering the nest of the wealthiest Americans—90 of the Fortune 500 companies making billions of dollars not paying a cent in taxes; reducing taxes to the point that people who are making—you know, if you're a husband and wife, a schoolteacher and a cop, you're paying at a higher rate than the average person making a billion dollars a year is—something is wrong. Their newfound concern.
I'm concerned—look, I meant what I said when I ran. And a lot of you still think I'm wrong, and I respect that. I said: ""I'm running for three reasons: to restore the soul, dignity, honor, honesty, transparency to the American political system; two, to rebuild the backbone of this country—the middle class, hard-working people, and people struggling to get in the middle class. They built America, and unions built them."" The third reason I said I was running was to unite the country. And, generically speaking, all of you said, ""No, you can't do that."" Well, I've not been able to unite the Congress, but I've been uniting the country, based on the polling data. We have to come together. We have to.
So, from my perspective, you know, it's a—to me, it's about just, you know, getting out there, putting one foot in front of the other and just trying to make things better for people—just hard-working people. People get up every morning and just want to figure out how to put food on the table for their kids, to be able have a little bit of breathing room, being able to have—make sure that they go to bed not staring at the ceiling, like my dad, wondering whether they—since he didn't have health insurance, what happens if mom gets sick or he got sick. These are basic things. Basic things.
And I'm of the view that the vast majority of people, including registered Republicans, by and large, share that same view, that same sense of what is—you know, what's appropriate.
Justin. Justin Sink, Bloomberg.
China-U.S. Relations/Investment in Science and Technology 
Q. Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to ask about your relationship with China now that you've been in office for a couple months. There's obviously the meeting in Alaska that was a little theatrical, and there's the continued human rights abuses.
So today I'm wondering: Are you more likely than you were when you came into office to maintain tariffs on China? Are you considering banning imports of forced-labor products? And would you consider cutting off U.S. investment or Chinese access to international payment systems?
The President. Well, look, they're each specifically legitimate questions, but they only touch a smidgen of what the relationship with China really is about.
I've known Xi Jinping for a long time. Allegedly, by the time I left office as Vice President, I had spent more time with Xi Jinping than any world leader had, because President Obama and the Chinese President Hu decided we should get to know one another since it was inappropriate for the President of the United States to spend time with the Vice President of another country. But it was obvious he was going to become the new leader of China.
So I spent hours upon hours with him alone with an interpreter—my interpreter and his—going into great detail. He is very, very straightforward. Doesn't have a democratic—with a small ""D""—bone in his body. But he's a smart, smart guy. He's one of the guys, like Putin, who thinks that autocracy is the wave of the future and democracy can't function in an ever—an ever-complex world.
So, when I was elected and he called to congratulate me, I think to the surprise of the China experts who were—his people were on the call as well as mine, listening—we had a 2-hour conversation. For 2 hours. And we made several things clear to one another. I made it clear to him again what I've told him in person on several occasions: that we're not looking for confrontation, although we know there will be steep, steep competition.
Two, that we'll have strong competition, but we'll insist that China play by the international rules: fair competition, fair practices, fair trade.
Thirdly, in order to compete effectively, I indicated that we're going to deal with China effectively, and we're going to need three things to do that. I tell him, our people. First, we're going to invest in American workers and American science. I said that all through the campaign and I say it again. And we're—and I'm setting up my administration to be able to do that, which is that, you know, back in the sixties, we used to invest a little over 2 percent of our entire GDP in pure research and investment in science. Today, it's 0.7 percent. I'm going to change that. We're going to change that.
The future lies in who can, in fact, own the future as it relates to technology, quantum computing, a whole range of things, including in medical fields. And so what I'm going to do is make sure we invest closer to 2 percent.
One of the reasons why I've set up the—the PAB [PCAST]*—the President's board with scientists and the like, again—is we're going to invest in medical research—cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, the things—industries of the future—artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotech. And we're going to make real investments. China is outinvesting us by a long shot, because their plan is to own that future.
The third—the second thing we're going to do is, we're going to reestablish our alliances. And I've been very clear with him, it's not anti-Chinese. And we've talked about it.
I want to make sure that, for example, later today, after this—as a matter of fact, shortly after this, which is fine; we've been going close to an hour. I'm happy to go longer. But one of the things that I'm going to be doing, I'm going to be speaking with the 27 heads of state in Europe and very shortly—I think within the next hour or so. I don't know the exact time.
And earlier this month—and apparently, it got the Chinese's attention; that's not why I did it—I met with our allies and how we're going to hold China accountable in the region: Australia, India, Japan, and the United States—the so-called Quad. Because we have to have democracies working together.
Before too long, I'm going to have—I'm going to invite an alliance of democracies to come here to discuss the future. And so we're going to make it clear that in order to deal with these things, we are going to hold China accountable to follow the rules—to follow the rules—whether it relates to the South China Sea or the North China Sea or their agreement made on Taiwan or a whole range of other things.
And the third thing, and the thing that I admire about dealing with with Xi is, he understands—he makes no pretense about not understanding what I'm saying any more than I do him—I pointed out to him: No leader can be sustained in his position or her position unless they represent the values of the country. And I said as—""And, Mr. President, as I've told you before, Americans value the notion of freedom. America values human rights. We don't always live up to our expectations, but it's a value system. We are founded on that principle. And as long as you and your country continues to so blatantly violate human rights, we're going to continue, in an unrelenting way, to call it to the attention of the world and make it clear—make it clear—what's happening.""
And he understood that. I made it clear that no American President—at least one did—but no American President ever back down from speaking out of what's happening to the Uyghurs, what's happening in Hong Kong, what's happening in-country. That's who we are. The moment a President walks away from that, as the last one did, is the moment we begin to lose our legitimacy around the world. It's who we are.
So I see stiff competition with China. China has an overall goal, and I don't criticize them for the goal, but they have an overall goal to become the leading country in the world, the wealthiest country in the world, and the most powerful country in the world. That's not going to happen on my watch, because the United States are going to continue to grow and expand.
Global Status of Democracy 
Q. All right. Just to follow up on the meeting of democracies: Is that where you expect, in a multilateral way, to make these decisions about sanctions? Or——
The President. No, that's not where I make the decision; that's where I make sure we're all on the same page. All on the same page. Look, I predict to you, your children or grandchildren are going to be doing their doctoral thesis on the issue of who succeeded: autocracy or democracy? Because that is what is at stake, not just with China.
Look around the world. We're in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution of enormous consequence. Will there be middle class? How will people adjust to these significant changes in science and technology and the environment? How will they do that? And are democracies equipped—because all the people get to speak—to compete?
It is clear, absolutely clear—and most of the scholars I dealt with at Penn agree with me around the country—that this is a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21st century and autocracies.
If you notice, you don't have Russia talking about communism anymore. It's about an autocracy. Demand decisions made by a leader of a country—that's what's at stake here. We've got to prove democracy works.
Gun Control Legislation/Infrastructure Investment/Climate Resilience 
Q. And, Mr. President, sorry, I know you haven't had a chance to address the tragedies in Georgia and Colorado. You had said to stay tuned for actions that you might take on gun control. Wondering if you've made a decision either about sending the manufacturer liability bill that you had promised on day one to Capitol Hill, or Executive actions like going after ghost guns or giving money to cities and States to battle gun control.
The President. All the above. It's a matter of timing.
As you've all observed, successful Presidents—better than me—have been successful, in large part, because they know how to time what they're doing—order it, decide on priorities, what needs to be done.
The next major initiative is—and I'll be announcing it Friday in Pittsburgh, in detail—is to rebuild the infrastructure—both physical and technological infrastructure in this country—so that we can compete and create significant numbers of really good-paying jobs. Really good-paying jobs.
And some of you have been around long enough to know that used to be a great Republican goal and initiative. I still think the majority of the American people don't like the fact that we are now ranked, what, 85th in the world in infrastructure. I mean, look, the future rests on whether or not we have the best airports that are going to accommodate air travel, ports that you can get in and out of quickly, so businesses decide.
Some of you, if you were ever local reporters, and you found your Governor or mayor trying to attract business to your community, what's the first thing that business asked? ""What's the closest access to an interstate highway? How far am I from a freight rail? Is the water available? Is there enough water available for me to conduct my business?"" All the things that relate to infrastructure.
We have somewhere—I asked the staff to write it down for me, and they did—not for this, but for a longer discussion. We have somewhere, in terms of infrastructure—we have—we rank 13th globally in infrastructure. China is investing three times more in infrastructure than the United States is.
Bridges: More than one third of our bridges—231,000 of them—need repairs. Some are physical safety risks or preservation work. One in five miles of our highways and major roads are in poor condition. That's 186,000 miles of highway. Aviation: 20 percent of all flights—20 percent of all flights—weren't on time, resulting in 1.5 million hours lost in production. Six to ten million homes in America still have lead pipes servicing their water lines. We have over 100,000 wellheads that are not capped, leaking methane.
What are we doing? And by the way, we can put as many pipefitters and miners and the rest to work capping those wells at the same price that they would charge to dig those wells. So I just find it frustrated—frustrating to talk about.
Last point I'll make on the infrastructure—and I apologize for spending more time on it, but—is that if you think about it, it's the place where we will be able to significantly increase American productivity, at the same time providing really good jobs for people. But we can't build back to what they used to be. We have to build—the environment has already—global warming has already done significant damage.
The roads that used to be above the water level—didn't have to worry about where the drainage ditch was—now you've got to rebuild them 3 feet higher. Because it's not going to go back to what it was before; it will only get worse, unless we stop it.
There's so much we can do. Look at all of the schools in America. Most of you live in the Washington area now. But, in your hometowns—I don't know where you're all from—how many schools where the kids can't drink the water out of the fountain? How many schools are still in the position where there's asbestos? How many schools in America we're sending our kids to don't have adequate ventilation? How many homes, buildings, office complexes are wasting billions of barrels of oil over time because they can't hold in the heat or the air conditioning because it leaks through the windows that are so porous and the connections? It's amazing.
So there's so much we can do that's good stuff, makes people healthier, and creates good jobs.
And I think that I've got one more question here. Janet [Janet Rodriguez] from Univision.
Illegal Immigration/Unaccompanied Minors at the Mexico-U.S. Border 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. We, too, have been reporting at the border. And just like Cecilia, we ran into a pair of siblings who came in on Monday, who were detained by CBP—had the phone number for their mother who lives in the U.S. We have contacted the mother. That's the only way they know her kids are here because CBP, today, Thursday, has not contacted that mother. So when can we expect your promise of things getting better with contacting and expediency and processing?
The President. Well, they're already getting better, but they're going to get real—they'll get a whole hell of lot better real quick, or we're going to hear of some people leaving, okay?
We can get this done. We're going to get it done.
I had a long meeting with the entire team and several Cabinet-level officers the other night. We're going to be moving, within the next—within the next week, over 100,000—I mean, 1,000 people out of the Border Patrol into safe, secure beds and facilities. We're going to significantly ramp up. We're already out there contacting everyone, from getting some of the employees at HHS—and there's a lot of them doing other things—and move them into making those calls. We're in a—we're in the process of rearranging and providing for the personnel needed to get that done.
But I admire the fact that you were down there; you're making the calls yourself. It's real.
The next thing that has to happen though—as you well know has to happen—there have to be some certitude that this is the—actually mom, dad, or whomever. And there's ways to do that. There's ways to do that—a little bit like determining whether or not you've got the right code for your credit card, you know? ""What was your dog's name?"" kind of a thing. I'm being a bit facetious, but not really. And also seeking harder data, from DNA to birth certificates, which takes longer.
So I want to do this as quickly as humanly possible and as safely as possible.
Immigration Reform 
Q. As you well know, treating the root causes in Latin America doesn't change things overnight. How do you realistically and physically keep these families from coming to the U.S. when things will not get better in their countries right away?
The President. Well, I can't guarantee that. But I know, you know, that old thing: The journey of 1,000 miles starts with the first step.
You know as well as I do; you cover it: You have serious—it's not like somebody at a sitting hand-hewn table in Guatemala—I mean, in somewhere in Mexico or in Guadalupe, saying: ""I've got a great idea. Let's sell everything we have. Give it to a coyote. Have him take our kids across the border and into a desert where they don't speak the language. Won't that be fun? Let's go."" That's not how it happens. People don't want to leave.
When my great-grandfather got on a coffin ship in the Irish Sea, expectation was: Was he going to live long enough on that ship to get to the United States of America? But they left because of what the Brits had been doing. They were in real, real trouble. They didn't want to leave. But they had no choice. So you've got—we can't—I can't guarantee we're going to solve everything, but I can guarantee we can make everything better. We can make it better. We can change the lives of so many people.
And the other thing I want to point out to you and I hope you point out: I realize it's much more heart wrenching—and it is—to deal with a 5- and 6- and 7-year-old. But you went down there, and you saw: The vast majority of these children—70 percent—are 16 years old, 17 years old, and mostly males. Doesn't make it—that doesn't make it good, bad, or indifferent. But the idea that we have tens of thousands of kids in these God-awful facilities that are, really, little babies crying all night—and there's some; that's true. That's why we've got to act.
And yesterday I asked my team—both the Director of the two agencies, as well as others—I asked them what would they, in fact—and I asked their opinion because they're the experts—but I said, ""Focus on the most vulnerable immediately.""
But there's no reason why, in the next month, as people cross the border, that phone call can't be made in the first 48 hours and begin.
Q. If I may ask one last question: Have you had any talks with Senate Republicans who are threatening this administration with not considering the immigration legislation that was passed in the House until the situation at the border has been resolved?
The President. No, because I know they have to posture for a while. They sort of got to get it out of their system. This is a—but I'm ready to work with any Republican who wants to help solve the problem and make the situation better.
But, folks, I'm going. Thank you very, very much. I appreciate it. Thank you."
"January 19, 2022",The President's News Conference,Joseph R. Biden,"Joseph R. Biden, The President's News Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/354148",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1269,"The President. Hello, folks. Thanks for being here.
Well, good afternoon, everyone. Tomorrow will mark 1 year since I took office. It's been a year of challenges, but it's also been a year of enormous progress. We went from 2 million people being vaccinated at the moment I was sworn in to 210 million Americans being fully vaccinated today. We created 6 million new jobs, more jobs in 1 year than at any time before.
Unemployment dropped—the unemployment rate dropped to 3.9 percent. Child poverty dropped by nearly 40 percent—the biggest drop ever in American history. New business applications grew by 30 percent, the biggest increase ever.
And for the first time in a long time, this country's working people actually got a raise—actually got a raise. The people—the bottom 40 percent saw their income go up the most of all those that got a raise.
We cut health insurance premiums for millions of American families. And we just made surprise medical bills illegal in this country. You know those bills you get that you don't expect—up to $2,000 or $5,000—from a hospital, beyond what you thought you were going to have to owe because of the consultation you weren't told was going to cost that much? No more. They're now illegal.
Thanks to the American Rescue Plan and other actions we've taken, we've seen record job creation and record economic growth in the past year. Now, thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure bill, we're about to make a record investment in rebuilding America to take us to be the number-one best infrastructure in the world. Well, now we're way below that.
We'll be creating better jobs for millions of people modernizing our roads, our bridges, our highways, our ports, our airports—everything from making clean water; lead—removing lead pipes that every American can turn on—every American can turn on a faucet and drink clean water: urban and rural and suburban communities.
It's going to make affordable high-speed internet available to every American in urban, rural, and suburban areas. We've never done that before. Now we are. We're in the process of that getting that done.
Still, for all this progress, I know there's a lot of frustration and fatigue in this country. And we know why: COVID-19. Omicron has now been challenging us in a way that—it's the new enemy. But while it's cause for concern, it's not cause for panic.
We've been doing everything we can, learning and adapting as fast as we can, and preparing for a future beyond the pandemic. While I know that after almost 2 years of physical, emotional, and psychological weight of this pandemic, and has—the impact it's had on everyone, for many of us, it's been too much to bear. We're in a very different place now though.
We have the tools—vaccines, boosters, masks, tests, pills—to save lives and keep businesses and schools open. Seventy-five percent of adults are fully vaccinated. We've gone from 90 million adults with no shots in arms last summer down to 35 million with no shots as of today. And we're adding about 9 million more vaccinations each week.
We're going to stick with our vaccination efforts because vaccinations work. So get vaccinated, please. And get your booster.
Look, we're also increasing testing. Should we have done more testing earlier? Yes. But we're doing more now. We've gone from zero at-home tests a year ago to 375 million tests on the market in just this month. If you buy a test at a store, your insurance will reimburse you.
On top of that, we're making 1 billion—1 billion—at-home tests available for you to order and be delivered to your home for free. Just visit COVIDtests.gov to know how to get that free test kit to your home. In addition, there are 20,000 sites where you can get tested in person for free, now.
And now we have more treatments that people can—that—for people—to keep people out of the hospital than any other point in the pandemic, including lifesaving antiviral pills. We purchased 20 million of these new Pfizer pills, more than any country in the world.
The bottom line on COVID-19 is that we are in a better place than we've been and have been thus far, clearly better than a year ago. We're not going back—we're not going back to lockdowns. We're not going back to closing schools. Schools should stay open.
Because of the American Rescue Plan, we provided to States $130 billion—$130 billion—to keep our students and educators safe and schools open: funding for ventilation systems in schools, social distancing, hygiene for classrooms and the schoolbuses. In addition, we've added another $10 billion for COVID-19 tests to be able to be administered at schools.
And many States and school districts have spent this money very well. Unfortunately, some haven't. I encourage the States and school districts that use the funding to protect our children and keep their schools open: Use it.
The COVID-19 is not going to give up and accept things—you know, it's just—it's not going to go away immediately. But I'm not going to give up and accept things as they are now.
Some people may call what's happening now the ""new normal."" I call it a job not yet finished. It will get better. We're moving toward a time when COVID-19 won't disrupt our daily lives; where COVID 19 won't be a crisis but something to protect against and a threat [treat].* Look, we're not there yet, but we will get there.
Now, the second challenge we're facing are prices. COVID-19 has created a lot of economic complications, including rapid price increases across the world economy. People see it at the gas pumps, the grocery stores, and elsewhere.
So here's what we're going to do. A critical job in making sure that the elevated prices don't become entrenched rests with the Federal Reserve, which has a dual mandate: full employment and stable prices. The Federal Reserve provided extraordinary support during the crisis for the previous year and a half.
Given the strength of our economy and the pace of recent price increases, it's appropriate, as the Federal Chairman, Chairman Powell—the Fed Chairman, Powell, has indicated—to recalibrate the support that is now necessary.
I respect the Fed's independence. And I've nominated five superb individuals to serve on the Federal Board of Governors, men and women from a variety of ideological perspectives. They're eminently qualified, historically diverse, and have earned bipartisan praise. And I call on the United States Senate to confirm them without any further delay.
And here at the White House and for my friends in Congress, the best thing to tackle high prices is a more productive economy with greater capacity to deliver goods and services to the American people, and a growing economy where folks have more choices and more small businesses can compete and where more goods can get to market faster and cheaper.
I've laid out a three-part plan to do just that. First, fix the supply chain. COVID-19 has had a global impact on the economy. When a factory shuts down in one part of the world, shipments to shops and homes and businesses all over the world are disrupted. COVID-19 has compounded that many times over.
A couple of months ago, in this very room, we talked—we heard dire warnings about how these supply chain problems could create a real crisis around the holidays. So we acted. We brought together business and labor, and that much-predicted crisis did not occur.
Ninety-nine percent of the packages were delivered on time, and shelves were stocked. And notwithstanding the recent storms that have impacted many parts of our country, the share of goods in stock at stores is 89 percent now, which is barely changed from the 91 percent before the pandemic. I often see empty shelves being shown on television. Eighty-nine percent are full, which is only a few points below what it was before the pandemic.
But our work is not done. My infrastructure law will supercharge our effort, upgrading everything from roads and bridges to ports and airports, railways and transit, to make the economy move faster and reduce prices for families.
Second thing: My Build Back Better plan will address the biggest costs that working families face every day. No other plan will do more to lower the costs for American families. It cuts the cost of—for childcare.
Many families, including the people sitting in this room, if they have children and they're working full time, many families pay up to $14,000 a year for childcare in big cities, less than that in smaller ones. My plan cuts that in half.
That will not only be a game-changer for so many families' budgets, but it will mean so much for the nearly 2 million women who—women who've left the workforce during the pandemic because of things like childcare.
My Build Back Better plan cuts the price of prescription drugs. So insulin that today costs some people as much as $1,000 a month will cost no more than $35 a month.
It cuts the cost of eldercare. It lowers energy costs. And it will do all of this without raising a single penny in taxes on people making under $400,000 a year or raising the deficit. In fact, my plan cuts the deficit, and it boosts the economy by getting more people into the workforce.
That's why 17 Nobel prize winners for economics say it will ease long-term inflationary pressure. The bottom line: If price increases are what you're worried about, the best answer is my Build Back Better plan.
Third thing we're going to do: promote competition. Look, in too many industries, a handful of giant companies dominate the market in sectors like meat processing, railroads, shipping, and other areas. This isn't a new issue. It's not been the reason we've have high inflation today. It's not the only reason. It's been happening for a decade.
But over time, it has reduced competition; squeezed out small businesses and farmers, ranchers; and increased the price for consumers. We end up with an industry like the meat-processing industry where four big companies dominate the markets, pay ranchers less for their cattle they grow, charge consumers more for beef, hamburger meat, whatever they're buying. Prices are up.
Look, I'm a capitalist. But capitalism without competition is not capitalism, it's exploitation. So I signed an Executive order to tackle unfair competition in our economy, and we're going to continue to enforce it, along with working with Congress where we can.
I'll close with this: We have faced some of the biggest challenges that we've ever faced in this country these past few years: challenges to our public health, challenges to our economy. But we're getting through it. And not only are we getting through it, we're laying the foundation for a future where America wins the 21st century by creating jobs at a record pace. Now we need to get inflation under control.
We have developed an extraordinarily effective booster shots and antiviral pills. Now we need to finish the job to get COVID-19 under control.
I've long said it's never been a good bet to bet against the American people or America. I believe that more than ever today. We've seen the grit and determination of the American people this past year. But the best days of this country are still ahead of us, not behind us.
Now I'm happy to take questions.
Yes.
The President's Accomplishments/Republican Party/Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I know some of my colleagues will get into some specific issues, but I wanted to zoom out on your first year in office.
Inflation is up. Your signature domestic legislation is stalled in Congress. In a few hours from now, the Senate—an effort in the Senate to deal with voting rights and voting—voting reform legislation is going to fail. COVID-19 is taking the lives of 1,500 Americans every day. And the Nation's divisions are just as raw as they were a year ago. Did you overpromise to the American public what you could achieve in your first year in office? And how do you plan to course-correct going forward?
The President. Why are you such an optimist? [Laughter]
Look, I didn't overpromise, and—but I have probably outperformed what anybody thought would happen. The fact of the matter is that we're in a situation where we have made enormous progress. You mentioned the number of deaths from COVID; well, it was three times that not long ago. It's coming down. Everything is changing. It's getting better.
Look, I didn't overpromise, but I think if you take a look at what we've been able to do, you'd have to acknowledge we made enormous progress.
But one of the things that I think is something that—one thing I haven't been able to do so far is get my Republican friends to get in the game of making things better in this country. For example, I was reading the other day—and I wrote the quote down so I don't misquote him—a quote from Senator Sununu, when he decided that he wasn't going to—excuse me, Governor Sununu—when he decided he wasn't going to run for the Senate in New Hampshire.
Here's what he said: ""They were all, for the most""—quote—""They were all, for the most part, content with the speed at which they weren't doing anything. It was very clear that we just had to hold the line for 2 years. Okay, so I'm just going to be a roadblock for the next 2 years? That's not what I do,"" Sununu said.
He went on to say, ""It bothered me that they were okay with that."" And then he goes on to say, ""I said, okay, so we're not going to get stuff done if we win the White House back""—""if we win the White House back."" ""Why didn't [we] do [anything] in 2017 and 2018?"" And then, he said—how did the Republicans Sununu spoke to answer the challenge? He said: ""Crickets. Yes, crickets. They had no answer.""
I did not anticipate that there'd be such a stalwart effort to make sure that the most important thing was that President Biden didn't get anything done. Think about this: What are Republicans for? What are they for? Name me one thing they're for.
And so the problem here is that I think what happens—what I have to do, and the change in tactic, if you will: I have to make clear to the American people what we are for. We've passed a lot. We've passed a lot of things that people don't even understand what's all that's in it, understandably.
Remember when we passed the Affordable Care Act and everybody thought that—you know, and it really was getting pummeled and beaten? And it wasn't until after you're out of office, and that next campaign when—that off-year campaign. And I went into a whole—I wasn't in office anymore. We were in a whole bunch of districts campaigning for Democrats in Republican districts who said they wanted to do away with health care, with Obamacare.
And I started pointing out that if you did that, preexisting conditions would no longer be covered. And they said: ""Huh? We didn't know that. We didn't know that."" And guess what? We won over 38 seats because we explained to the people exactly what, in fact, had passed.
And one of the things that I remember saying—and I'll end this—I remember saying to President Obama, when he passed the Affordable Care Act—I said, ""You ought to take a victory lap."" And he said, ""There's so many things going on, we have don't have time to take a victory lap.""
As a consequence, no one knew what the detail of the legislation was. They don't know a lot of the detail of what we passed. So the difference is, I'm going to be out on the road a lot, making the case around the country, with my colleagues who are up for reelection and others, making the case of what we did do and what we want to do, what we need to do.
And so I don't think I've overpromised at all. And I'm going to stay on this track.
You know, one of the things that I remember—and I'll end this with—I was talking with, you know, Jim Clyburn, who was a great help to me in the campaign in South Carolina. And Jim said—and when he would endorse me—and there was a clip on television the last couple days of Jim. And it said that we want to make things accessible and affordable for all Americans. That's health care, that's education, that's prescription drugs, that's making sure you have access—access—to all the things that everybody else has. We can afford to do that. We can't afford not to do it.
So I tell my Republican friends: Here I come. This is going to be about, ""What are you for?""—""What are you for?""—and lay out what we're for.
Mary Bruce, ABC.
The President's Legislative Agenda 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned your Republican colleagues. But right now, your top two legislative priorities—your social spending package and voting rights legislation—are stalled, blocked by your own party, after months of negotiation.
You are only guaranteed control of Washington for 1 more year before the midterms. Do you need to be more realistic and scale down these priorities in order to get something passed?
The President. No, I don't think so. When you say ""more realistic,"" I think it's extremely realistic to say to people, because—let me back up. You all really know the politics in this country, and your networks and others. You've spent a lot of time, which I'm glad you do, polling this data, determining where the—what the American people's attitudes are, et cetera. The American people overwhelmingly agree with me on prescription drugs. They overwhelmingly agree with me on the cost of education. They overwhelmingly agree with me on early education. They overwhelmingly—and go on the list—on childcare.
And so we just have to make the case what we're for and what the other team is not for. Look, we knew all along that a lot of this was going to be an uphill fight. And one of the ways to do this is to make sure we make the contrast as clear as we can.
And one of the things that I think is—we're going to have to do is just make the case. I don't think there's anything unrealistic about what we're asking. I'm not trying to—I'm not asking for castles in the sky; I'm asking for practical things the American people have been asking for for a long time—a long time. And I think we can get it done.
Q. You say, though, that you're not going to scale down any of these priorities. But, so far, that strategy isn't working. You haven't been able to get some of these big legislative ticket items done.
The President. Oh, I got two real big ones done, bigger than any President has ever gotten in the first year. [Laughter]
Q. But currently, Mr. President, your spending package, voting rights legislation, they're not going anywhere.
The President. That's true.
Build Back Better Act/Voting Rights Legislation/2022 Congressional Elections 
Q. So is there anything that you are confident you can get signed into law before the midterm elections?
The President. Yes, I'm confident we can get pieces—big chunks—of the Build Back Better law signed into law.
And I'm confident that we can take the case to the American people that the people they should be voting for—who are going to oversee whether your elections, in fact, are legit or not—should not be those who are being put up by the Republicans to determine that they're going to be able to change the outcome of the election.
So whether or not we can actually get election—and by the way, I haven't given up. We haven't finished the vote yet on what's going on the—on voting rights and the John Lewis bill and others.
But so, look, this is—I've been engaged a long time in public policy. And I don't know many things that have been done in one fell swoop. And so I think the best—the most important thing to do is try to inform—not educate—inform the public of what's at stake, in stark terms, and let them make judgments, and let them know who's for them and who's against them, who's there and who's not there, and make that the case. And that's what I'm going to be spending my time doing in this off-year election.
Senator W. Mitt Romney/Voting Rights Legislation 
Q. And just very quickly, you mentioned Republicans and reaching out to them. Some Republicans who may be open to major changes on voting rights—for instance, like Mitt Romney—he says he never even received a phone call from this White House. Why not?
The President. Well, I like Mitt—look, Mitt Romney is a straight guy. He's—and one of the things that we're doing, I was trying to make sure we got everybody on the same page in my party on this score. And I didn't call many Republicans at all.
The fact is that there—I do think that Mitt is a serious guy. I think we can get things done. I think—I predict to you they'll get something done on the electoral reform side of this.
But rather than judge what's going to get done and not get done, all I can say is, I'm going to continue to make the case why it's so important to not turn the electoral process over to political persons who are set up deliberately to change the outcome of elections.
The—Allison Harris [NewsNation], please.
Voting Rights/2022 Congressional Elections/Voter Turnout 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Speaking of voting rights legislation, if this isn't passed, do you still believe the upcoming election will be fairly conducted and its results will be legitimate?
The President. Well, it all depends on whether or not we're able to make the case to the American people that some of this is being set up to try to alter the outcome of the election. And it's one thing—look, maybe I'm just being too much of an optimist. Remember how we thought not that many people were going to show up to vote in the middle of a pandemic? We had the highest voter turnout in the history of the United States of America.
Well, I think if in fact—no matter how hard they make it for minorities to vote, I think you're going to see them willing to stand in line and defy the attempt to keep them from being able to vote. I think you're going to see the people who they're trying to keep from being able to show up, showing up and making the sacrifice that needs to make in order to change the law back to what it should be.
And—but it's going to be difficult. I make no bones about that. It's going to be difficult. But we're not there yet. We've not run out of options yet. And we'll see how this moves.
School Closings/Federal Assistance for Schools 
Q. And on Omicron and education, teachers are in result in some—in revolt in so many places. Parents are at odds over closing schools and remote learning. You say we're not going to go back to closing schools—you said that just moments ago—yet they're closing in some areas. What do you say to those teachers and principals and parents about school closings? And what can your administration do to help make up for learning loss for students?
The President. First of all, I'd put in perspective the question you asked. Very few schools are closing. Over 95 percent are still open.
So you all phrase the questions when people—I don't think it's deliberate on your part, but you phrase the question—if anyone watches this on television—""My God, there must be—all those schools must be closing. What are we going to do?"" Ninety-five percent are still open, number one.
Number two, the idea that parents don't think it's important for their children to be in school, and teachers know it as well—that's why we made sure that we had the ability to provide the funding through the Recovery Act—through the act that we—the first act we passed—to be able to make sure schools were able to be safe.
So we have new ventilation systems available for them. We have—the way they handle—they scrub down laboratories and—I mean, the lavatories kids go to, to go to the bathroom—cafeterias, buses, et cetera. That—all that money is there. There's billions of dollars made available. That's there.
Not every school district has used it as well as it should be used. But it's there. And so, in addition to that, there is now another $10 billion for testing of students in the schools.
So I think, as time goes on, it's much more likely you're going to see that number go back up from 95 percent, back up to 98, 99 percent.
But the outfit of the individuals of the district that says ""We're not going to be open"" is always going to get—and I'm not being critical of any of you—it's always going to get front page. It's always going to be the top of the news. But let's put it in perspective: 95—as high as 98—percent of the schools in America are open, functioning, and capable doing the job.
How about Jen Epstein, Bloomberg?
Russia/Ukraine 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. Your top foreign policy advisers have warned that Russia is now ready to attack Ukraine. But there's still little unity among European allies about what a package of sanctions against Moscow would look like. If the U.S. and NATO aren't willing to put troops on the line to defend Ukraine and American allies can't agree on a sanctions package, hasn't the U.S. and the West lost nearly all of its leverage over Vladimir Putin?
And given how ineffective sanctions have been in deterring Putin in the past, why should the threat of new sanctions give him pause?
The President. Well, because he's never seen sanctions like the ones I promised will be imposed if he moves, number one.
Number two, we're in a situation where Vladimir Putin is about to—we've had very frank discussions, Vladimir Putin and I. And the idea that NATO is not going to be united, I don't buy. I've spoken to every major NATO leader. We've had the NATO-Russian summit. We've had other—the OSCE has met, et cetera.
And so I think what you're going to see is that Russia will be held accountable if it invades. And it depends on what it does. It's one thing if it's a minor incursion and then we end up having a fight about what to do and not do, et cetera.
But if they actually do what they're capable of doing with the forces amassed on the border, it is going to be a disaster for Russia if they further invade Ukraine, and that our allies and partners are ready to impose severe costs and significant harm on Russia and the Russian economy.
And you know, we're going to fortify our NATO allies, I told him, on the eastern flank—if, in fact, he does invade. We're going to—I've already shipped over $600 million worth of sophisticated equipment, defensive equipment to the Ukrainians.
The cost of going into Ukraine, in terms of physical loss of life, for the Russians, they'll—they'll be able to prevail over time, but it's going to be heavy, it's going to be real, and it's going to be consequential.
In addition to that, Putin has—you know, has a stark choice: He—either deescalation or diplomacy; confrontation or the consequences.
And look, I think you're going to see—for example, everybody talks about how Russia has control over the energy supply that Europe absorbs. Well, guess what? That money that they earn from that makes about 45 percent of the economy. I don't see that as a one-way street. They go ahead and cut it off—it's like my mother used to say: ""You bite your nose off to spite your face."" It's not like they have all these wonderful choices out there.
I spoke with the Prime Minister of Finland. And you know, we're talking about concern on the part of Finland and Sweden about what Russia is doing. The last thing that Russia needs is Finland deciding to change its status. They didn't say they're going to do that, but they're talking about what, in fact, is going on and how outrageous Russia is being.
We're finding ourselves in a position where I believe you will see that there'll be severe economic consequences. For example, anything that involves dollar denominations, if they make—if they invade, they're going to pay; they're not going—their banks will not be able to deal in dollars.
So there's—a lot is going to happen.
But here's the thing: My conversation with Putin—and we've been—how can we say it? We have no problem understanding one another. He has no problem understanding me, nor me him. And the direct conversations where I pointed out—I said: ""You know, you've occupied, before, other countries. But the price has been extremely high. How long? You can go in and, over time, at great loss and economic loss, go in and occupy Ukraine. But how many years? One? Three? Five? Ten? What is that going to take? What toll does that take?"" It's real. It's consequential.
So this is not all just a cakewalk for Russia.
Militarily, they have overwhelming superiority, and on—as it relates to Ukraine. But they'll pay a stiff price—immediately, near term, medium term, and long term—if they do it.
Umm—I'm sorry. Okay. David Sanger, New York Times.
Russia/Ukraine/North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to follow up on your answer there about Russia and Ukraine. When you were in Geneva in June, you said to us, about President Putin, ""I think the last thing . . . he wants now is a cold war.""
Now, since then, of course, you've seen him gather these troops—100,000 troops—around Ukraine. Your Secretary of State said today he thought he could invade at any moment. You've seen the cyber attacks. And you've seen the demand that he have a sphere of influence in which you would withdraw all American troops and nuclear weapons from what used to be the Soviet bloc.
So I'm wondering if you still think that the last thing he wants is a cold war. And has your view of him changed in the past few months? And if it has and he does invade, would your posture be to really move back to the kind of containment policy that you saw so often when you were still in the Senate?
The President. The answer is that I think he still does not want any full-blown war, number one.
Number two, do I think he'll test the west, test the United States and NATO as significantly as he can? Yes, I think he will. But I think he'll pay a serious and dear price for it that he doesn't think now will cost him what it's going to cost him. And I think he will regret having done it.
Now, whether or not—I think that—how can I say this in a public forum? I think that he is dealing with what I believe he thinks is the most trag","ic thing that's happened to Mother Russia—in that the Berlin Wall came down, the empire has been lost, the ""near abroad"" is gone, et cetera. The Soviet Union has been split.
But think about what he has. He has eight time zones, a burning tundra that will not freeze again naturally, a situation where he has a lot of oil and gas, but he is trying to find his place in the world between China and the west.
And so I'm not so sure that he has—David, I'm not so sure he has—is certain what he's going to do. My guess is he will move in. He has to do something.
And by the way, I've indicated to him—the two things he said to me that he wants guarantees of: One is, Ukraine will never be part of NATO. And two, that NATO, or the—there will not be strategic weapons stationed in Ukraine. Well, we could work out something on the second piece, depending what he does along the Russian line as well—or the Russian border, in the European area of Russia.
On the first piece, we have a number of treaties internationally and in Europe that suggest that you get to choose who you want to be with. But the likelihood that Ukraine is going to join NATO in the near term is not very likely, based on much more work they have to do in terms of democracy and a few other things going on there and whether or not the major allies in the west would vote to bring Ukraine in right now.
So there's room to work if he wants to do that. But I think, as usual, he's going to—well, I probably shouldn't go any further. But I think it will hurt him badly.
Russia/Ukraine/North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Q. Mr. President, it sounds like you're offering some way out here, some off-ramp. And it sounds like what it is, is—at least in the informal assurance—that NATO is not going to take in Ukraine anytime in the next few decades. And it sounds like you're saying we would never put nuclear weapons there. He also wants us to move all of our nuclear weapons out of Europe and not have troops rotating through the old Soviet bloc.
Do you think there's space for there as well?
The President. No. No, there's not space for that. We won't permanently station. But the idea we're not going to—we're going to actually increase troop presence in Poland, in Romania, et cetera, if in fact he moves because we have a sacred obligation in article 5 to defend those countries. They are part of NATO. We don't have that obligation relative to Ukraine, although we have great concern about what happens in Ukraine.
Thank you.

COVID-19 Testing/Build Back Better Act 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to follow up on your comment on Build Back Better and also ask you a question about the pandemic.
You said that you're confident you can pass ""big chunks"" of Build Back Better this year. Does that wording mean that you are thinking about—you're looking at breaking the package up into individual portions?
And then, on the pandemic: Now that the Supreme Court has blocked the vaccination-or-test rule for larger businesses, are you reconsidering whether to require vaccines for domestic flights as a way to boost vaccination rates?
The President. No, look, first of all, on the last part of the question: The Supreme Court decision, I think, was a mistake. But you still see thousands and thousands of people who work for major corporations having to be tested as a consequence of the decision made by the corporation and not by the standard I set that is there. I think you'll see that increase, not decrease, number one.
What was the first part of your question?
Q. On your comment that you made that you're confident——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——that major chunks of Build Back Better——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——can pass. Are you breaking it up? Does that mean——
The President. Yes. Well, it's clear to me that—that we're going to have to probably break it up. I think that we can get—and I've been talking to a number of my colleagues on the Hill—I think it's clear that we would be able to get support for the 500-plus billion dollars for energy and the environmental issues that are there, number one.
Number two, I know that the two people who've opposed, on the Democratic side at least, support a number of the things that are in there. For example, Joe Manchin strongly supports early education, 3 and 4 years of age. Strongly supports that. There is strong support for, I think, a number of the way in which to pay for these—pay for this proposal.
So I think there is—and I'm not going to—I'm not going to negotiate against myself as to what should and shouldn't be in it, but I think we can break the package up, get as much as we can now, and come back and fight for the rest later.

Inflation/Gasoline Prices 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you about the economy. As you said earlier, Americans are feeling the squeeze——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——of inflation. Oil prices have been at about a 7-year high recently. How long should Americans expect to face higher prices when they're at the grocery store or when they're at the gas pump? Is this something that they're going to see into the summer, into next fall?
And separately, you know, you talk about the importance of the Fed, but isn't that an acknowledgment that you're limited in what you can do if you—if you're relying on the Fed to make decisions and you're unable to get a Build Back Better proposal through, aren't you simply limited in what you can do to deal with inflation?
The President. Well, look, as you know, Ken, the inflation has everything to do with the supply chain. And I think what you're seeing is that we've been able to make progress on speeding up the access to materials. For example, one third of the cost—of the increase in cost of living is the cost of automobiles.
The reason automobiles have skyrocketed in price is because of the lack of computer chips. So we have the capacity, and we're going to do everything in our power to do it to become self-reliant on the computer chips that we need in order to be able to produce more automobiles. That's underway.
We've already passed, within the context of another bill, money for that in the—in the House of Representatives. It's before the House of Representatives now. But I think there's a way we can move to—if we can move to get, for example, that one thing done, it can make a big difference in terms of the cost of—the total cost of living.
Now, with regard to the whole issue of energy prices, that gets a little more complicated. But you saw what happened when I was able to convince everyone from—including China, India—a number of other countries—to agree with us to go into their version of the—of their petroleum reserve to release more into the market so that—that brought down the price about 12, 15 cents a gallon in some places, some places more.
There's going to be a reckoning along the line here as to whether or not we're going to continue to see oil prices continue to go up in ways that are going up now, relative to what is going to—what impact that's going to have on the producers.
And so it's going to be hard. I think that's the place where most middle class people, working class people get hit the most. They pull up to a pump, and all of a sudden, instead of paying $2.40 a gallon, they're paying $5 a gallon. And that's going to be really difficult.
But—so we're going to continue to work on trying to increase oil supplies that are available. And I think there's ways in which we can be of some value added in terms of the price of gas—natural gas and the like—to take the burden off of European countries that are now totally dependent on Russia. But it's going to be hard. It's going to be very hard.
But I think that we have to deal with—for example, like I said, you have a circumstance where people are paying more for a pound of hamburger meat than they ever paid. Well, one of the reasons for that is, you don't have that many folks out there that are ones that are—we've got the Big Four controlling it all.
And so you're going to see, more and more, we're going to move on this competition piece to allow more and more smaller operations to come in and be able to engage in providing—buying and providing the access to much cheaper meat than exists now. But it's going to be a haul.
Now, and as you—I assume the reason you said if I can't get Build Back Better is, it relates to what those 17 Nobel laureate economists said: that if in fact we could pass it, it would actually lower the impact on inflation, reduce inflation over time, et cetera.
So there's a lot we have to do. It's not going to be easy, but I think we can get it done. But it's going to be painful for a lot of people in the meantime. That's why the single best way—the single best way—to take the burden off middle class and working class folks is to pass the Build Back Better piece that are things that they're paying a lot of money for it now.
If you get to trade off higher gas as—you're putting up with a higher price of hamburgers and gas, versus whether or not you're going to have to—you're going to be able to pay for education and/or childcare and the like, I think most people would make the trade. Their bottom line would be better in middle class households.
But it's going to be hard. And it's going to take a lot of work.
China-U.S. Trade 
Q. If I may follow, sir: You mentioned China. Do you think the time has come to begin lifting some of the tariffs on Chinese imports? Or is there a need for China to make due on some of its commitments in the Phase One agreement? Some business groups would like you to begin raising—lifting up those tariffs on China.
The President. Well, I know that, and that's why my Trade Rep is working on that right now. The answer is uncertain. It's uncertain.
I'd like to be able to be in a position where I can say they're meeting the commitments, or more of their commitments, and be able to lift some of it. But we're not there yet.
Nancy [Nancy Cordes], CBS.
Senate Minority Leader A. Michell McConnell/2022 Congressional Elections/Republican Party 
Q. Thank you so much, Mr. President. This afternoon, the Senate Minority Leader, Mitch McConnell, said that the midterms elections are going to be a report card on your progress on inflation, border security, and standing up to Russia. Do you think that that's a fair way to look at it? And if so, how do you think that report card looks right now?
The President. I think the report card is going to look pretty good, if that's where we're at. But look, the idea that—Mitch has been very clear he's going to do anything to prevent Biden from being a success.
And I get on with Mitch. I actually like Mitch McConnell. We like one another. But he has one straightforward objective: make sure that there's nothing I do that makes me look good in the mind—in his mind with the public at large. And that's okay. I'm a big boy. I've been here before.
But the fact is that I think that the—I'm happy to debate and have a referendum on how I handle the economy, whether or not I've made progress on when—look, again—how can I—I'm taking too long answering your questions. I apologize.
I think that this—the fundamental question is: What's Mitch for? What's he for on immigration? What's he for? What's he proposing to make anything better? What's he for dealing with Russia that's different than I'm proposing and many of his Republican friends or his colleagues are supporting as well? What's he for on these things? What are they for?
So everything is a choice—a choice.
I think they—look, I've laid out a proposal on immigration that if we passed it, we'd be in a totally different place right now. But we're not there because we don't have a single Republican vote. My buddy John McCain is gone.
So, I mean, it's just—it's going to take time. And again, I go back to—I go back to Governor Sununu's quote.
How long—I mean—a rhetorical question. I don't—I know this is not fair to ask the press a question; I'm not asking you. But think about—did you ever think that one man out of office could intimidate an entire party where they're unwilling to take any vote contrary to what he thinks should be taken for fear of being defeated in a primary?
I've had five Republican Senators talk to me, ""bump into me""—quote, unquote—or sit with me, who've told me that they agree with whatever I'm talking about for them to do. ""But, Joe, if I do it, I'm going to get defeated in a primary."" We've got to break that. That's got to change.
And I doubt—you're all—I'm not being—it sounds like I'm being solicitous—you're all bright as hell, well informed—more informed than any group of people in America. But did any of you think that you'd get to a point where not a single Republican would diverge on a major issue? Not one?
Anyway.
Q. Can you tell us who those five Republican Senators are?
The President. Sure. No. [Laughter] Are you kidding me? I maintain confidentiality.
Q. On voting rights——
The President. But I'm sure you've spoken to some. [Laughter]
Q. On voting rights, sir——
The President. Yes.
Voting Rights 
Q. At your first press conference, 10 months ago, I asked you if there was anything you could do beyond legislation to protect voting rights. And at that time, you said, ""Yes, but I'm not going to lay out a strategy before you and the world now."" Now that legislation appears to be hopelessly stalled, can you now lay out your strategy to protect voting rights?
The President. Well, I'm not prepared to do that in detail, in terms of the Executive orders I may be able to engage in and other things I can do. But one of—the things we have done: We have significantly beefed up a number of enforcers in the Justice Department, who are there to challenge these unconstitutional efforts—in our view—unconstitutional efforts on the part of the Republicans to stack the election and subvert the outcome.
We have begun to organize in ways that we didn't before in communities beyond the civil rights community to make the case to the rest of American people what's about to happen, what will happen if in fact these things move forward.
If I had talked to you—not you; I'm using ""you"" in a total sense. If I had talked to the public about the whole idea of subversion of elections by deciding who the electors are after the fact, I think people would've looked at me like, ""Whoa.""
I mean, I caught—taught constitutional law for 20 years—a three-credit course on the separation of powers. And—on Saturday mornings, when I was a Senator. And I never thought we'd get into a place where we were talking about being able to actually—what they tried to do this last time out is send different electors to the State legislative bodies to represent who won the election, saying that I didn't win, but a Republican candidate won. I doubt that anybody thought that would ever happen in America in the 21st century, but it's happening.
And so I think—I guess what I'm saying is, Nancy—is that I think there are a number of things we can do, but I also think we will be able to get significant pieces of the legislation—if we don't get it all now—to build to get it so that we get a big chunk of the John Lewis legislation, as well as the fair elections bills.
COVID-19 Vaccines 
Q. Sir, on COVID, if you don't mind: You touted the number of Americans who are now fully vaccinated with two shots. But even some of your own medical advisers say that people aren't fully protected unless they have that third shot——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——a booster. Why hasn't this White House changed the definition of ""fully vaccinated"" to include that third booster shot? Is it because the numbers of fully vaccinated Americans would suddenly look a lot less impressive?
The President. No, it's not that at all. It's just, this has become clearer and clearer, and every time I speak of it, I say: If you've been vaccinated, get your booster shot. Everybody get the booster shot. It's the optimum protection you could have. You're protected very well with two shots, if it's the Pfizer—anyway, you're protected. But you are better protected with the booster shot.
Q. But you won't change the definition right now?
The President. I'm following what the—the answer is, yes. Get the booster shot. It's all part of the same thing. You're better protected.
Okay. Alex Alper, Reuters.
Russia/Ukraine/North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to follow up briefly on a question asked by Bloomberg. You said that Russia would be ""held accountable if it invades"" and ""it depends on what it does""; ""it's one thing if it's a minor incursion and . . . we end up having to fight about what to do and what not to do.""
Are you saying that a minor incursion by Russia into Ukrainian territory would not lead to the sanctions that you have threatened? Or are you effectively giving Putin permission to make a small incursion into the country?
The President. [Laughter] Good question.
Q. Thanks.
The President. That's how it did sound like, didn't it?
The most important thing to do: Big nations can't bluff, number one. And number two, the idea that we would do anything to split NATO, which would be a—have a profound impact on one of—I think prominent impact—on one of Putin's objectives is to weaken NATO—would be a big mistake.
So the question is, if it's a—something significantly short of a significant invasion—or not even significant, just major military forces coming across—for example, it's one thing to determine that if they continue to use cyber efforts, well, we can respond the same way, with cyber.
They have FSB people in Ukraine now trying to undermine the solidarity within Ukraine about Russia and to try to promote Russian interest. But it's very important that we keep everyone in NATO on the same page. And that's what I'm spending a lot of time doing. And there are differences. There are differences in NATO as to what countries are willing to do depending on what happens, the degree to which they're able to go.
And I want to be clear with you: The serious imposition of sanctions relative to dollar transactions and other things are things that are going to have a negative impact on the United States, as well as a negative impact on the economies of Europe as well, and a devastating impact on Russia. And so I've got to make sure everybody is on the same page as we move along.
I think we will, if there's something that is—that—where there's Russian forces crossing the border, killing Ukrainian fighters, et cetera—I think that changes everything. But it depends on what he does, as to the exact—to what extent we're going to be able to get total unity on the Russia—on the NATO front.
Iran 
Q. If I may ask a quick one on Iran, I just wanted to get your sense of whether the Vienna talks are making any progress, if you still think it's possible to reach a deal for both sides to resume compliance with the Iran nuclear deal or if it's time to give up on that. Thank you.
The President. I'll do it in reverse. It's not time to give up. There is some progress being made. The P5-plus-1 is on the same page. But it remains to be seen.
Okay. Kristen [Kristen Welker], NBC.
Russia/Ukraine 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Very quickly on Russia—I do have a number of domestic policy issues, but I'm—on Russia very quickly: It seemed like you said that you have assessed, you feel as though he will move in. Has this administration, have you determined whether President Putin plans to invade or move into Ukraine, as you've said?
The President. Look, the only thing I'm confident of is that decision is totally, solely, completely a Putin decision. Nobody else is going to make that decision; no one else is going to impact that decision. He's making that decision.
And I suspect it matters which side of the bed he gets up on in the morning as to exactly what he's going to do. And I think it is not irrational, if he wanted to, to talk about dealing with strategic doctrine and dealing with force structures in Europe and in the European parts of Russia.
But I don't know if he's decided he wants to do that or not. So far, in the three meetings we've had—OSCE and—anyway—have not produced anything because the impression I get from my Secretary of State, my National Security Adviser, and my other senior officials that are doing these meetings is that there's a question of whether the people they're talking to know what he's going to do.
So the answer is—but based on a number of criteria as to what he could do—for example, for him to move in and occupy the whole country, particularly from the north, from Belarus, it's—he's going to have to wait a little bit until the ground is frozen so he can cross.
To move in a direction where he wants to talk about what's going—we have—we're continuing to provide for defense capacities to the Ukrainians. We're talking about what's going on in both the Baltic and the Black Sea, et cetera. There's a whole range of things that I'm sure he's trying to calculate how quickly he can do what he wants to do and what does he want to do.
But I—he's not—he's an informed individual. And I'm sure—I'm not sure—I believe he's calculating what the immediate, short-term, and the near-term, and the long-term consequences of Russia will be. And I don't think he's made up his mind yet.
Q. I want to ask you about your domestic agenda. You've gotten a lot of questions about voting rights, Mr. President. But I want to ask you about Black voters, one of your most loyal constituencies.
The President. Yes.
African American Voters/Voting Rights Legislation 
Q. I was in Congressman Clyburn's district yesterday in South Carolina. You opened this news conference talking about him. I spoke to a number of Black voters who fought to get you elected, and now they feel as though you are not fighting hard enough for them and their priorities. And they told me they see this push on voting rights more as a last-minute PR push than it is a legitimate effort to get legislation passed.
So what do you say to these Black voters who say that you do not have their backs, as you promised on the campaign trail?
The President. I've had their back. I've had their back my entire career. I've never not had their back. And I started on the voting rights issues long, long ago. That's what got me involved in politics in the first place.
And I think part of the problem is—look, there's significant disagreement in every community on whether or not the timing of assertions made by people has been in a most timely way. So I'm sure that there are those who are saying that: ""Why didn't Biden push the John Lewis bill as hard as he pushed it the last month? Why didn't he push it 6 months ago as hard as he did now?""
The fact is that there is—there's a timing that is not of one's own choice; it's somewhat dictated by events that are happening in country and around the world as to what the focus is.
But part of the problem is, as well, I have not been out in the community nearly enough. I've been here an awful lot. I find myself in a situation where I don't get a chance to look people in the eye, because of both COVID and things that are happening in Washington, to be able to go out and do the things that I've always been able to do pretty well: connect with people, let them take a measure of my sincerity, let them take a measure of who I am.
For example—I mean, as I pointed out in South Carolina, you know, last time, when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I got the Voting Rights Act extended for 25 years, and I got Strom Thurmond to vote for it. That's what I've been doing my whole career. And so the idea that I—that I didn't either anticipate or because I didn't speak to it as fervently as they want me to earlier.
In the meantime, I was spending a lot of time—spent hours and hours and hours talking with my colleagues on the Democratic side, trying to get them to agree that if in fact this occurred, if this push continued, that they would be there for John Lewis and—anyway.
So—but I think that's—that's a problem that is my own making by not communicating as much as I should have. Yet you find that when you deal with Members of the Black Caucus and others in the United States Congress, I still have very close working relationships.
So it's like every community. I'm sure that there are those in the community, in—I'm a big labor guy. I'm sure there's people in labor saying, ""Why haven't they been able to do A, B, C, or D?""
So it's just going to take a little bit of time.
Vice President Kamala D. Harris/2024 Presidential Election/Voting Rights 
Q. You put your—you put Vice President Harris in charge of voting rights. Are you satisfied with her work on this issue? And can you guarantee—do you commit—that she will be your running mate in 2024, provided that you run again?
The President. Yes, and yes.
Q. Okay. You don't care to expand?
The President. Pardon me?
Q. Do you care to expand——
The President. No, there's no need to.
Q. ——on voting?
The President. I mean, I asked the—he—she is going to be my running mate—number one. And number two, I did put her in charge. I think she's doing a good job. [Laughter]
The President's Remarks on Voting Rights in Atlanta, Georgia/Republican Party 
Q. Let me ask you—big picture: Particularly when you think about voting rights and the struggles you've had to unify your own party around voting rights, unity was one of your key campaign promises.
The President. Yes.
Q. In fact, in your Inaugural Address, you said your ""whole soul"" was in ""bringing America together, uniting our people. . . ."" People heard the speech that you gave on voting rights in Georgia recently in which you described those who are opposed to you to George Wallace and Jefferson Davis, and some people took exception to that.
What do you say to those who are offended by your speech? And is this country more unified than it was when you first took office?
The President. Number one: Anybody who listened to the speech—I did not say that they were going to be a George Wallace or a Bull Connor. I said we're going to have a decision in history that is going to be marked just like it was then. You either voted on the side—that didn't make you a George Wallace or didn't make you a Bull Connor.
But if you did not vote for the Voting Rights Act back then, you were voting with those who agreed with Connor, those who agreed with—and so—and I think Mitch did a real good job of making it sound like I was attacking them. If you've noticed, I haven't attacked anybody publicly—any Senator, any—any Congressman publicly. And my disagreements with them have been made to them—communicated to them privately or in person with them.
My desire still is—look, I underestimated one very important thing: I never thought that the Republicans—like, for example, I said—they got very upset—I said there are 16 Members of the present United States Senate who voted to extend the Voting Rights Act.
Now, they got very offended by that. That wasn't an accusation; I was just stating a fact. What has changed? What happened? What happened? Why is there not a single Republican, not one? That's not the Republican Party.
National Unity/Democracy 
Q. But, Mr. President——
The President. So that's not an attack.
Q. ——is the country more unified—is the country more unified than when you first took office?
The President. The answer is: Based on some of the stuff we've got done, I'd say yes, but it's not nearly unified as it should be.
Look, I still contend—and I know you'll have a right to judge me by this—I still contend that unless you can reach consensus in a democracy, you cannot sustain the democracy.
And so this is a real test—whether or not my counterpart in China is right or not when he says autocracies are the only thing that could prevail because democracies take too long to make decisions and countries are too divided.
I believe we're going through one of those inflection points in history that occurs every several generations or even more than that—even more time than that, where things are changing almost regardless of any particular policy.
The world is changing in big ways. We're going to see—you've heard me say this before—we're going to see more change in the next 10 years than we saw in the last 50 years because of technology, because of fundamental alterations and alliances that are occurring not because of any one individual, just because of the nature of things.
And so I think you're going to see an awful lot of transition. And the question is: Can we keep up with it? Can we maintain the democratic institutions that we have, not just here but around the world, to be able to generate democratic consensus of how to proceed?
It's going to be hard. It's going to be hard, but it requires—it requires—leadership to do it. And I'm not giving up on the prospect of being able to do that.
Thank you.
Q. Mr. President, one more. Mr. President—[inaudible]?
Afghanistan/5G Cellular Communications Technology Deployment/COVID-19 Response Efforts 
Q. Mr. President, thank you, sir. There are deep questions among Americans about the competence of Government, from the messy rollout of 5G this week, to the Afghanistan withdraw, to testing on COVID. What have you done to restore Americans' faith in the competence of Government? And are you satisfied by the view of the competence of your Government?
The President. Look, let's take Afghanistan. I know you all would like to focus on that, which is legitimate. We were spending a trillion dollars a week—I mean, a billion dollars a week in Afghanistan for 20 years.
Raise your hand if you think anyone was going to be able to unify Afghanistan under one single Government. It's been the graveyard of empires for a solid reason: It is not susceptible to unity, number one.
So the question was: Do I continue to spend that much money per week in the state of Afghanistan, knowing that the idea that being able"," to succeed—other than sending more body bags back home—is highly, highly unusual?
My dad used to have an expression. He'd say, ""Son, if everything is equally important to you, nothing is important to you."" There was no way to get out of Afghanistan, after 20 years, easily. Not possible no matter when you did it. And I make no apologies for what I did.
I have a great concern for the women and men who were blown up on the line at the airport by a terrorist attack against them. But the military will acknowledge—and I think you will, who know a lot about foreign policy—that had we stayed and I had not pull those troops out, we would be asked to put somewhere between 20- and 50,000 more troops back in.
Because the only reason more Americans weren't being killed—and others—is because the last President signed an agreement to get out by May the 1st, and so everything was copacetic.
Had we not gotten out—and the acknowledgement is, we'd be putting a lot more forces in. You know, am I—do I feel badly what's happening to—as a consequence of the incompetence of the Taliban? Yes, I do.
But I feel badly also about the fistulas that are taking place in the Eastern Congo. I feel badly about a whole range of things around the world—that we can't solve every problem. And so I don't view that as a competence issue.
The issue of whether or not there's competence, in terms of whether or not we're dealing with 5G or not: We don't deal with 5G. The fact is that you had two enterprises—two private enterprises—that had one promoting 5G and the other one are airlines. They're private enterprises. They have Government regulation, admittedly.
And so what I've done is pushed as hard as I can to have 5G folks hold up and abide by what was being requested by the airlines until they could more modernize over the years so that 5G would not interfere with the potential of the landing. So any tower—any 5G tower within a certain number of miles from the airport should not be operative.
And that's—and so I understand. But anything that happens that's consequential is viewed as the Government's responsibility. I get that.
Am I satisfied with the way in which we have dealt with COVID and all the things that—that go along with it? Yes, I am satisfied. I think we've done remarkably well.
You know, the idea that——
Q. On testing, sir.
The President. On testing, we've done—we should have done it quicker, but we've done remarkable since then. What we have is, we have more testing going on than anywhere in the world. And we're going to continue to increase that.
Did we have it at the moment exactly when we should have moved, and could we have moved a month earlier? Yes, we could have. But with everything else that was going on, I don't view that as somehow a mark of incompetence.
Look, think of what we did on COVID. When—when we were pushing on AstraZeneca [Pfizer]* to provide more vaccines—well, guess what? They didn't have the machinery to be able to do it. So I physically went to Michigan, stood there in a factory with the head of the—of AstraZeneca [Pfizer],* and said, ""We'll provide the machinery for you. This is what we'll do. We'll help you do it so that you can produce this vaccine more rapidly."" I think that's pretty hands-on stuff.
We also said, right now, when people—the hospitalizations are—are overrunning hospitals and you have docs and nurses out because of COVID—they have COVID—we put thousands of people back in those hospitals. Look at all the marines—all the military personnel we have there, first responders.
Nobody has ever organized—nobody has ever organized a strategic operation to get as many shots in arms by opening clinics and keeping—and being able to get so many people vaccinated.
What I'm doing now is not just getting significant amounts of vaccines to the rest of the world, but they now need—the mechanical way is how they get shots in arms. So we're providing them the know-how to do that. Now, should everybody in America know that? No, they don't necessarily know that; they're just trying to figure how to put three squares on the table and stay safe.
But so I do think the place where I was a little disappointed—I wish we could have written it differently—is when we did the legislation to provide the funding for COVID and the money we provided for the States to be able to deal with keeping schools open.
Some of them didn't do a very good job. Some are still holding the money. I don't have the authority to do anything about that. I think that's not particularly competent. There's things that could and should have been done, that could have moved faster.
So I understand the frustration. You know, I remember—I think it was—I forget which Cabinet member was saying to Barack Obama—something was going on, and he said: ""Well, you can be sure, Mr. President, of the millions of employees you have out there, somebody is screwing up right now. Somebody is screwing up.""
So it's—you know, it's just a—but I think you have to look at things that we used to look at it on balance. What is the trajectory of the country? Is it moving in the right direction now?
I don't know how we can say it's not. I understand the overwhelming frustration, fear, and concern with regard to inflation and COVID. I get it. But the idea—if I told you, when we started, I told you what I'm going to do—""The first year, I'm going to create over 600—or 6 million jobs. I'm going to get unemployment down to 3.9 percent. I'm going to generate""—and I named it all, you'd look at me like, ""You're nuts."" Maybe I'm wrong.
The President's 2022 Governing Strategy 
Q. Sir, there's never been a President, at least in our recent memory, with this much Washington experience as you have entered this office with, but yet, after we sit here for more than an hour, I'm not sure I've heard you say if you would do anything differently in the second year of your term. Do you plan to do anything differently? It could be——
The President. Yes, look, the thing I have to do——
Q. ——are you satisfied with your team here at the White House, sir?
The President. I'm satisfied with the team.
There's three things I'm going to do differently now that I will—now that I've gotten the critical crises out of the way, in the sense of that moving—knowing exactly where we're going.
Number one, I'm going to get out of this place more often. I'm going to go out and talk to the public. I'm going to do public fora. I'm going to interface with them. I'm going to make the case of what we've already done, why it's important, and what we'll do if—what will happen if they support what else I want to do.
Number two, I'm bringing in more and more—now that I have time—I mean, literally, like you, it's—I'm not complaining. It's, you know, 12, 14 hours a day. No complaints. I really mean that sincerely.
But now that certain of the big chunks have been put in place and we know the direction, I'm also going to be out there seeking the—more advice of experts outside, from academia, to editorial writers, to think tanks. And I'm bringing them in, just like I did early on, bringing in Presidential historians to get their perspective on what we should be doing. Seeking more input, more information, more constructive criticism about what I should and shouldn't be doing.
And the third thing I'm going to be doing a lot more of is being in a situation where I am able to bring—I'm going to be deeply involved in the off—these off-year elections. We're going to be raising a lot of money. We're going to be out there making sure that we're helping all of those candidates.
And scores of them have already asked me to come in and campaign with them, to go out and make the case in plain, simple language as to what it is we've done, what we want to do, and why we think it's important.
Q. Mr. President——
The President. How many more hours am I doing this? I'm happy to stick around.
Q. Mr. President, can I ask you about—[inaudible]? Mr. President——
The President. You always ask me the nicest questions.
Q. All right, I've got a whole binder full.
The President. I know you do.
Q. All right——
The President. None of them make a lot of sense to me, but I—[laughter].
Q. Well, let's—let's try——
The President. Fire away. Come on.
The President's Legislative Agenda 
Q. A new year. Why are you trying so hard in your first year to pull the country so far to the left?
The President. Well, I'm not. I don't know what you consider to be too far to the left if, in fact, we're talking about making sure that we had the money for COVID, making sure we had the money to put together the bipartisan infrastructure, and making sure we were able to provide for those things that, in fact, would significantly reduce the burden on the working class people but make them—they have to continue to work hard. I don't know how that is pointed to the left.
If you may recall, I—you guys have been trying to convince me that I am Bernie Sanders. I'm not. I like him, but I'm not Bernie Sanders. I'm not a Socialist. I'm a mainstream Democrat, and I have been. And mainstream Democrats have overwhelmingly—if you notice, the 48 of the 50 Republican—Democrats supported me in the Senate on virtually everything I've asked.
Yes, sir.
2020 Presidential Election/2022 Congressional Elections/Election Integrity/Voting Rights 
Q. Thank you, sir. I just wanted to clarify: A moment ago, you were asked whether or not you believed that we would have free and fair elections in 2022 if some of these State legislatures reformed their voting protocols. You said that it depends. Do you think that they would in any way be illegitimate?
The President. Oh, yes, I think it easily could be illegitimate.
Imagine—imagine—if in fact Trump has succeeded in convincing Pence to not count the votes.
Q. Well, I——
The President. Imagine if——
Go on.
Q. In regard to 2022, sir, the midterm elections.
The President. Oh, 2022. I mean, imagine if those attempts to say that the count was not legit. ""You have to recount it, and we're not going to count—we're going to discard the following votes."" I mean, sure, but—I'm not going to say it's going to be legit. It's—the increase and the prospect of being illegitimate is in direct proportion to us not being able to get these reforms passed.
But I don't think you're going to see—you're not going to see me and I don't think you're going to see the Democratic Party give up on—coming back and assuming that the attempt fails today.
The President's Remarks on Voting Rights in Atlanta, Georgia 
Q. And then, one more, sir. You know, you campaigned and you ran on a return to civility. And I know that you dispute the characterization that you called folks who would oppose those voting bills as being ""Bull Connor"" or ""George Wallace,"" but you said that they would be sort of in the same camp.
The President. No, I didn't say that. Look what I said. Go back and read what I said and tell me if you think I called anyone who voted on the side of the position taken by Bull Connor that they were Bull Connor.
Q. And——
The President. That is an interesting reading of English. You—I assume you got into journalism because you liked to write.
Q. So did you expect that that would work with Senators Manchin or Sinema—that argument?
The President. No, here's the thing: There's certain things that are so consequential you have to speak from your heart as well as your head. I was speaking out forcefully on what I think to be at stake. That's what it is.
And by the way, no one—no one—forgets who was on the side of King or—versus on—or Bull Connor. No one not—does not. The history books will note it. And what—I was making the case: ""Don't think this is a freebie. You don't get to vote this way, and then somehow it goes away. This will be—stick with you the rest of your career and long after you're gone.""
Q. And, Mr. President, if——
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. Folks, I'm——
Q. Sir, what does the new normal look like?
The President. Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on, guys. We've only gone an hour and 20 minutes. I'll keep going.
But I'm—but I'm going to go—let me get—let get something straight here: How long are you guys ready to go? You want to go for another hour or two?
Q. Yes.
Q. Until we all get called on, sir.
Q. Until we all get a chance.
The President. Okay. I'm going to go—I'll tell you what, folks: I am going to go another 20 minutes, until a quarter of. Okay?
Yes, sir.
Q. Thank you, President Biden. President Biden, on the—thank you. On—I'll wait for the microphone.
President Biden, on the——
The President. I want to thank my communications staff for the great help here. [Laughter]
China/Coronavirus Origins 
Q. Well, President Biden, on the coronavirus, we're tragically approaching nearly 1 million Americans who died. And I'd like to ask you why it is during your 3½-hour virtual summit in November with the Chinese President you didn't press for transparency and also whether that has anything to do with your son's involvement in an investment firm controlled by Chinese state-owned entities.
The President. The answer is that we did—I did raise the question of transparency. I spent a lot of time with him. And he—the fact is that they're just not—they're just not being transparent.
Q. You raised this: transparency on the coronavirus origins?
The President. Yes.
Q. And—you did, during the virtual summit?
The President. Yes.
Q. Is there a reason your press staff was unaware of that? And what did you say to the Chinese President?
The President. Well—and they weren't with me the entire time. Look, I made it clear that I thought that China had an obligation to be more forthcoming on exactly what the source of the virus was and where it came from.
Yes.
Yemen 
Q. Mr. President, I would like to ask you about foreign policy: One of the first priority that you declared when you came to office was to end the war in Yemen—that catastrophic war in Yemen. You appointed a special envoy.
Today, one of your allies—the United Arab Emirates—is asking your administration to put back the Houthi rebels or militias back on the terror list. Are you going to do that?
And how are you going to end the war in Yemen, sir?
The President. The answer is, it's under consideration. And ending the war in Yemen takes the two parties to be involved to do it. And it's going to be very difficult.
Yes.
The President's Mental Fitness 
Q. Thank you very much for this honor. James Rosen with Newsmax. I'd like to—I'd like to raise a delicate subject, but with utmost respect for your life accomplishments and the high office you hold: A poll released this morning by Politico/Morning Consult found 49 percent of registered voters disagreeing with the statement, ""Joe Biden is mentally fit.""
The President. [Laughter] Well——
Q. Not even a majority of Democrats who responded strongly affirmed that statement.
The President. Well, I'll let you all make the judgment whether they're correct. Thank you.
Q. Well, so the question I have for you, sir, before—if you'd let me finish—is: Why do you suppose such large segments of the American electorate have come to harbor such profound concerns about your cognitive fitness? Thank you.
The President. I have no idea.
Yes, sir.
National Unity/The President's Legislative Agenda 
Q. Thanks, Mr. President. I appreciate it. I'm—I wanted to sort of address—or ask about a tension that has sort of been in this—in this press conference on unifying the country, because you campaigned on two things. One of them is being able to accomplish big things, and the other is the ability to unify the country. And even today you've talked about sort of a different posture with Republicans. And I wonder if you still think it's possible to do both of those things?
The President. We have to. We have to. And let me—I'm not—as long as I hold public office, I'm going to continue to attempt to do both things.
The President's Accomplishments 
Q. One more follow-up. Last—around this time last year when you were campaigning in Georgia, I think one of the things you told people was, ""The power is literally in your hands."" You know, if voters give Democrats the House and the Senate and the Presidency, that all these big things can get accomplished. And you know, we've seen stalemate. We've seen things being stymied. Why should folks believe you this time around?
The President. Can you think of any other President that has done as much in 1 year? Name one for me.
Q. I'm asking you. I mean——
The President. I'm serious. You guys talk about how nothing has happened. I don't think there's been much on any incoming President's plate that's been a bigger menu than the plate I had given to me. I'm not complaining. I knew that running in.
And the fact of the matter is, we got an awful lot done—an awful lot done—and there's more to get done.
But look, let's—let me ask you a rhetorical question. No, I won't. Anyway. [Laughter]
Thank you.
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. Yes.
Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President.
Do I need the——
[At this point, a White House aide carrying a microphone tripped.]
The President. Be careful. Don't get hurt, man.
Russia-U.S. Relations/Ukraine 
Q. No, no, I'm—I'm going to take care.
Mr. President, thank you. Sebastian Smith from AFP. Another question on Ukraine. Ukraine borders four NATO member countries. How concerned are you? Are you concerned that a real conflagration in Ukraine—if the Russians really go in there—that it could suck in NATO countries that are on the border and you end up with an actual NATO-Russia confrontation of some kind?
And secondly, are you entertaining the thought of a summit with Vladimir Putin as a way to perhaps try and put this whole thing to bed, address their concerns, and negotiate a way out of this?
The President. The last part—to the last question, yes. When we talked about whether or not we'd—the three meetings we talked about. And we talked about: We would go from there, if there was reason to, to go to a summit. We talked about a summit as being before the Ukraine item came up in terms of strategic doctrine and what the strategic relationship would be. So I still think that is a possibility, number one.
Number two, I am very concerned. I'm very concerned that this could end up being—look, the only war that's worse than one that's intended is one that's unintended. And what I'm concerned about is, this could get out of hand—very easily get out of hand because of what you said: the borders of the—of Ukraine and what Russia may or may not do.
I am hoping that Vladimir Putin understands that he is—short of a full-blown nuclear war, he's not in a very good position to dominate the world. And so I don't think he thinks that, but it is a concern. And that's why we have to be very careful about how we move forward and make it clear to him that there are prices to pay that could, in fact, cost his country an awful lot.
But I—of course, you have to be concerned when you have, you know, a nuclear power invade—this has—if he invades—it hasn't happened since World War II. This will be the most consequential thing that's happened in the world, in terms of war and peace, since World War II.
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Yes.
COVID-19 Response Efforts/Antiviral Treatments/Global Vaccine Distribution 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. Nearly 2 years have passed since the beginning of the global coronavirus outbreak. And you again today acknowledged that Americans are frustrated and they're tired. Based on your conversations with your health advisers, what type of restrictions do you imagine being on Americans this time next year? And what does the new normal look like for social gatherings and travel to you?
The President. Well, the answer is, I hope the new normal will be that we don't have—still have 30-some million people not vaccinated. I hope the new normal is, people have seen—and what their own interest is and have taken advantage of what we have available to us.
Number two, with the pill that is probably—that appears to be as efficacious as it seems to be—that you're going to be able to deal with this virus in a way that, after the fact, you have the ability to make sure you don't get so—you don't get very sick.
Number three, I would hope that what happens is, the rest of the world does what I'm doing and provides significant amounts of the vaccine to the rest of the world. Because it's not sufficient that we just have this country not have the virus or be able to control the virus, but that—you can't build a wall high enough to keep a new variant out.
So it requires—one of the things that I want to do and we're contemplating—figuring out how to do—not—we are contemplating how to get done—and that is: How do we move in a direction where the world itself is vaccinated?
It's not enough just to vaccinate 340 million—fully vaccinate 340 million people in the United States. That's not enough. It's not enough to do it here. We have to do it, and we have to do a lot more than we're doing now.
And that's why we have continued to keep the commitment of providing vaccines and available cures for the rest of the world as well.
The President's Support Among Moderate and Independent Voters 
Q. And if I could, sir—and I should have said this before: Francesca Chambers, McClatchy—how do you plan to win back moderates and Independents who cast a ballot for you in 2020 but, polls indicate, aren't happy with the way you're doing your job now?
The President. I don't believe the polls.
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Well, why don't you just go down the row there.
COVID-19 Vaccines 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. To follow up on some of the questions about the vaccination program, you've given dozens of speeches this year urging Americans to get vaccinated. You've talked to reluctant Republicans. You've said it's people's patriotic duty.
There have been very few mentions of the fact that young children under the age of 5 still, in the third year of this pandemic in this country, don't have access to the vaccine. Can you speak to frustrated parents a little bit about why that continues to be the case and when that might change?
The President. Because the science hasn't reached a point where they're convinced that, in fact, it is safe. So that's what they're doing now. You could have asked me that—I got asked that question about 3 months ago, about people between the ages of, you know, 7 and 12. Well, they finally—they've got to the point where they felt secure in the number of tests they had done and the tests they had run that it was safe.
So it will come. It will come. But I can't—I'm not a scientist; I can't tell you when. But it is really very important that we get to that next piece.
Childcare Tax Credit/Community Colleges 
Q. Just one more follow-up on Build Back Better: When you said it's going to likely be broken up into chunks—you mentioned that the climate pieces seem to have broad support, you mentioned Senator Manchin is a supporter of early childcare—you left out the child tax credit. And I wonder if it's fair to read between the lines and assume that that is a piece, given Senator Manchin's opposition to it, that the extension of that is likely one of those components that may have to wait until sometime down the line.
The President. There's two really big components that I feel strongly about that I'm not sure I can get in the package: one is the childcare tax credit and the other is help for cost of community colleges. They are massive things that I've run on, I care a great deal about, and I'm going to keep coming back at in whatever fora I get to be able to try to get chunks or all of that done.
Yes, sir. Next man—next to your left.
Latin America-U.S. Relations/Addressing the Root Causes of Migration/Democratization 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. My name is Pedro Rojas. I'm with Univision National News. This is actually my first press conference here. It is good to meet you in person.
The President. We always have long press conferences like this. [Laughter]
Q. Awesome. Awesome.
I've got a couple of questions for you. Number one, you said that you want to convey your message by getting out there in the country. I wonder if you're planning on traveling also to South America and other countries in the Western Hemisphere, given the fact that China has gained a lot of influence in the region?
And the second question is: What would be your message for residents in this country that are struggling every time they go to the gas station, every time they go to the grocery store and see the prices going high—and the pharmacy? I happen to come from South Texas. What I saw a lot of—a lot of people struggling financially in the last few months. And so I think you—I wonder what is the message you want to spread to them?
The President. Well, I try to express—I've asked—I've tried to answer that seven different ways today about how to deal with inflation. But let me answer the first question.
I've spent a lot of time in South America and in Latin America. When I was Vice President, I spent the bulk of my 8 years basically in Europe and/or in Latin America. I'm in contact with the leaders of the countries in South America, and we're working closely with making sure that we do everything—for example, with the—to deal with helping the countries in question, particularly those in Central America, to be able to help them with their ability to deal with the internal—people don't sit around in Guatemala and say: ""I've got a great idea: Let's sell everything we have, give the money to a coyote, take us across a terribly dangerous trip up through Central America and up through Mexico, and drop us—sneak us across the border, drop us in the desert. Won't that be fun?""
People leave because they have real problems. And one of the things that I've done, when I was a Vice President, and got support with—although I don't have much Republican support anymore—is provide billions of dollars to be able to say to those countries, ""Why are people leaving? And how are you going to reform your own system?"" And that's what we've worked on a long time. It still needs a lot more work. And we're focusing on that.
I also believe—I've spent a lot of time talking about and dealing with policy having to do with Maduro, who is little more than a dictator right now, and the same thing in Chile and—not the same thing, but with Chile, as well as Argentina.
So, look, I made a speech a while ago, when I was Vice President, saying that if we were smart, we have an opportunity to make the Western Hemisphere a united—not united—a democratic hemisphere. And we were moving in the right direction under our—under the last administration—the Obama-Biden administration.
But so much damage was done as a consequence of the foreign policy decisions the last President made in Latin America, Central America, and South America that we now have—when I call for a Summit of the Democracies—I called that, and a number of nations showed up for this Summit of Democracy—what is it that's going to allow us to generate—we've actually had a reduction in the number of democracies in the world. And it seems to me there's nothing more important.
We used to talk about, when I was a kid in college, about ""America's backyard."" It's not America's backyard. Everything south of the Mexican border is America's front yard. And we're equal people. We don't dictate what happens in any other part of that—of this continent or the South American continent. We have to work very hard on it.
But the trouble is, we're having great difficulty making up for the mistakes that were made the last 4 years, and it's going to take some time.
Yes. Gentleman in the back. And then I'll go to this side, okay?
Republican Party 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Alexander Nazaryan, Yahoo! News. And thank you for holding this press conference. I hope there's more of them.
The President. Anytime you have an extra 3 hours, we can do it. [Laughter]
Q. We'll stay for a couple more.
You said you were surprised by Republican obstruction of your agenda. But didn't the GOP take exactly the same tactic when you were Vice President to Barack Obama? So why did you think they would treat you any differently than they treated him?
The President. Well, first of all, they weren't nearly as obstructionist as they are now, number one. They stated that, but you had a number of Republicans we worked with closely, from John McCain—I mean, a number of Republicans we worked closely with. Even, back in those days, Lindsey Graham.
And so the difference here is, there seems to be a desire to work—and I didn't say ""my"" agenda; I'm saying, what are they for? What—what is their agenda? They had an agenda back in the administration when—the 8 years we were President and Vice President, but I don't know what their agenda is now. What is it?
The American public is outraged about the tax structure we have in America. What are they proposing to do about it? Anything? Have you heard anything? I mean, anything. I haven't heard anything.
The American public is outraged about the fact that we're the—the state of the environment—the vast majority of the public. What have they done to do anything to ameliorate the climate change that's occurring, other than to deny it exists?
So what I'm saying is, the difference between then and now is not only the announcement that was made: ""Anything to stop Barack Obama."" I get that part. But what eventually happened? We were able to get some things done. We were able to work through some things. On the stuff that was really consequential, in terms of ideologically divisive, it was a real fight.
But so—but I don't think there's a time when I—I mean, I wonder what would be the Republican platform right now. What do you think? What do you think their position on taxes are? What do you think their position on human rights is? What do you think their position is on whether or not we should—on what we should do about the cost of prescripti","on drugs? What do you think?
I mean, I just—I, honest to God, don't know what they're for, yet I know a lot of these Senators and Congressmen, and I know they do have things they want to support, whether they're things I want or not. But you don't hear much about that.
And every once in a while, when you hear something where there's a consensus—it's important, but a small item, and it doesn't get much coverage at all where it occurs. I'm not meaning ""coverage."" I mean, there's not much discussion about it.
So I just think it's a different—and I don't know that no matter how strongly one supports, as a Republican, and/or supports the President—the former President of the United States—I don't know how we can't look at what happened on January 6 and think: ""That's a problem. That's a real problem.""
Q. One more question, Mr. President. There's been a——
The President. By the way, it's a quarter of, guys, so I'm going to do this—just let's—if you manage to make easy questions, then I'll give you quick answers.
Q. There's an increasing concern, I think among some Democrats, that even if schools do continue to open—and I get that most of them are now open—Republicans will weaponize this narrative of you—of you and other leading Democrats allowing them to stay closed in the midterms next year and that—you know, obviously, that issue has a lot of traction with suburban parents, as I think you saw in Virginia—-
The President. What do you mean ""allowing""? I'm confused by the question. I'm sorry.
2022 Congressional Elections/News Media 
Q. Well, that—could school reopenings or closures become a potent midterm issue for Republicans to win back the suburbs?
The President. Oh, I think it could be, but I hope to God that they're—that—look, maybe I'm kidding myself, but as time goes on, the voter who is just trying to figure out, as I said, how to take care of their family, put three squares on the table, stay safe, able to pay their mortgage or their rent, et cetera, has—is becoming much more informed on the motives of some of the political players and some of the—and the political parties. And I think that they are not going to be as susceptible to believing some of the outlandish things that have been said and continue to be said.
You know, every—every President, not necessarily in the first 12 months, but every President in the first couple of years—almost every President, excuse me, of the last Presidents—at least four of them—have had polling numbers that are 44 percent favorable.
So it's this idea that—but you all—not you all—but now it is, ""Well, Biden is at—one poll showed him at 33 percent. The average is 44—44, 45 percent. One poll had him at 49 percent."" I mean, the idea that—the American public are trying to sift their way through what's real and what's fake. And I don't think as—I've never seen a time when the political coverage—the choice of what political coverage a voter looks to has as much impact on as what they believe; they go to get reinforced in their views, whether it's MSNBC or whether it's Fox or whatever.
I mean—and one of the things I find fascinating that's happening—and you all are dealing with it every day—and it will impact on how things move—is that a lot of the speculation in the polling data shows that the—that the cables are heading south; they're losing viewership. You know? Well, Fox is okay for a while, but it's not gated. And a lot of the rest are predicted to be not very much in the mix in the next 4 to 5 years. I don't know whether that's true or not.
But I do know that we have sort of put everybody in—put themselves in certain alleys. And they've decided that, you know, how many people who watch MSNBC also watch Fox, other than a politician trying to find out what's going on in both places? How many people—again, I'm no expert in any of this. But the fact is, I think you have to acknowledge that what gets covered now is necessarily a little bit different than what gets covered in the past.
I've had a couple—well, I shouldn't get into this.
But the nature not—the nature of the way things get covered—and this is my observation over the years I've been involved in public life—changed. And it's changed because of everything from a thing called the internet. It's changed because of the way in which we have self-identified perspectives based on what channel you turn on, what—what network you look at—not network, but what cable you look at. And it's never quite been like that.
Anyway.
Q. [Inaudible]
Q. On behalf of the Correspondents' Association, thank you very much for——
The President. And then I'll go to you.
Q. ——for standing for our questions. We hope the public has found it as enlightening as those of us in the room have.
I want to ask you, sir, about one of the——
The President. You mean, I can still stand? It's amazing.
COVID-19 Response Efforts 
Q. Right. We appreciate it. We very much do.
So the question I want to ask you gets to accountability, sir, on one of the top public concerns, of course, which is the coronavirus and the Government's response to it.
Whether it's confusion over what style of mask to wear, when to test, how to test, where to test—you know, the public is confused, sir, and you see that in the dropoff in the polling on this question.
Why did you tell Jeff [Jeff Zeleny, CNN] that you were satisfied with your team? Why are you not willing to make or interested in making any changes, either at the CDC or other agencies, given the fact that the messages have been so confusing?
The President. Well, first of all, the messages, to the extent they've been confusing, is because the scientists—they're learning more. They're learning more about what's needed and what's not needed. And so the fact is that the one piece that has gotten a lot of attention is the communications capacity of the CDC. Well, she came along and said, ""Look, I'm not a""—I mean, ""I'm a scientist. And I'm learning. I'm learning how to deal with stating what is the case that we've observed.""
But look, I think that it's a little bit like saying—when we went through the whole issue of how to deal with polio and the polio shots, what was said in the beginning was: ""Oh, no, it's changed a little bit. We moved this way and that way."" Or when we dealt with anything else.
I mean, it's—this was a brandnew virus, a brandnew phenomenon. Some of it was deadly, otherwise more communicable. This is this is an unfolding story. It's the nature of the way diseases spread. We're going to learn about it in a lot of other areas, not just COVID-19.
And so I think—you know, I look at it this way: Think about how astounding it was within the timeframe that it took to be able to come up with a vaccine. You used to write about that. Pretty amazing how rapidly they came up with a vaccine that saved hundreds of thousands of lives.
Did everything get right? No.
And by the way, the idea whether we—anyway. I'm talking too much.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Yes, ma'am.
Bipartisanship 
Q. I have two really simple questions. I promise. You campaigned on canceling $10,000 in student loans. Do you still plan to do so and when?
And then, my second question is: Now that you've clarified the Bull Connor comments, do you plan to reach out to Republicans like Mitt Romney to talk about reforming the Electoral Count Act?
The President. Yes, I'm happy to speak out. I've—I've met with—I've talked to Mitt on other occasions. And by the way, I reached out to the minority leader as well at the time that he made his speech. And so I have no reluctance to reach out to any Republican and anyone who—and I've made it clear.
Look, I've now had the opportunity to travel because of funerals and eulogies I've made and attended—and Congressmen and Senators who have come along with me. I don't—don't hold me to the number, but somewhere between 20 and 25 Senators and Congresspersons have traveled with me.
And I find—you should get the list of them and ask what—how we, you know, sat for the 2, 3, 4, 5 hours that we've flown together—sit back in the—in that conference table and talk to them, ask them questions; they ask me questions. I learned a heck of a lot. But as President, you don't quite have that ability to do that as often as I'd like to be able to do it.
And one of the things that I do think that has been made clear to me—speaking of polling—is the public doesn't want me to be the ""President Senator."" They want me to be the President and let Senators be Senators.
And so, if I've made—and I've made many mistakes, I'm sure. If I made a mistake, I'm used to negotiating to get things done, and I've been, in the past, relatively successful at it in the United States Senate, even as Vice President. But I think that role as President is a different role.
Folks, it is now almost 6. With all due respect, I'm going to see you at the next conference. Okay? Thank you.
Q. Are you concerned about crime rates, Mr. President? Are you concerned about crime rates?"

Good afternoon. Good afternoon. And we welcome the President of the United Mexican States, Mr. Andrés Manuel López Obrador. With him, His Excellency Joseph Biden, Jr., President of the United States of America, and His Excellency, Mr. Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada. And we also have their respective delegations, representatives of the media, and people following us through internet, through the social media. Let's welcome two Presidents and Prime Minister.
Joseph Biden, Jr., President of the United States of America, you have the floor, sir.
President Biden. Thank you very much. It's wonderful to be back here in Mexico City. And I want to thank you, Mr. President, for hosting the Prime Minister and me for the 10th North American Leaders' Summit. This is a magnificent fora.
And we're true partners, the three of us, working together with mutual respect and a genuine like for one another to advance a safer and more prosperous future for all of our people. And the reason for this summit and this trilateral relationship are so impactful is because we share a common vision for the future, grounded on common values—and I mean that sincerely—common values we share in our countries.
Since becoming President, I've been laser-focused on rebuilding the U.S. economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not the trickle-down economy. Because the bottom up and the middle out, it works, because the wealthy do very well and everybody else does well too, but everybody does well. And ""from the bottom up"" is—means investing in priorities for working families.
And the United States has made historic, bipartisan investments in infrastructure and innovation that are already beginning to deliver concrete benefits for the American people, and, I would argue, it will ultimately reap benefits for the entire North America. We've renewed our dependence—our deep—and deepened our cooperation for—of the closest friends and allies, none closer than Mexico and Canada, to take on the biggest challenges facing the region and, quite frankly, the world.
Because there can no longer be any question—none—in today's interconnected world. We cannot wall ourself off from shared problems. We are stronger and better when we work together, the three of us. And together, we've made enormous progress since our last summit, from COVID—fighting COVID-19 and strengthening our ability to address public health threats, to investing in and building a 21st-century workforce.
At the top of our shared agenda today is keeping the—North America the most competitive, prosperous, and resilient economic region of the world. And the strength of our economic relationship among our nations not only supports good-paying jobs in all of our countries, but it generates tremendous growth. Now we're working to a future to strengthen our cooperation on supply chains and critical minerals so we can continue accelerating our efforts to build the technologies of tomorrow right here in North America.
This summit—this summit—also builds on the continual consultation and cooperation with one another to take on the challenges that impact all three of our nations.
Our entire hemisphere is experiencing unprecedented levels of migration, greater than any time in history. And North America—at the North America Summit Leader in—hosted in Washington in 2021, we launched the idea of a regional-wide approach—a regional-wide approach to a regional-wide problem. The idea grew into the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection, which 21 countries ultimately adopted at the Summit of the Americas 6 months ago.
And we're working together, especially with our North American partners, to fulfill our commitments under that declaration. They include the policy I announced last week to expand safe and legal pathways for immigrants from Nicaragua, Cuba, and Haiti that were seeking a better life here in the United States of America.
We also want to thank you, Mr. President, for stepping up to receive into Mexico those not following the lawful pathways we've made available, instead of—attempting to unlawfully cross the border between our countries.
On my way here, I stopped in El Paso, Texas, to see the situation with my own eyes and to meet with U.S. border security officials. It's putting real strain on the communities in both Mexico and the United States. We're working together to address this challenge in a way that upholds our nations' laws and protects the human rights of migrants facing desperate circumstances.
We're also working together to take on the scourge of human smuggling and illegal drug trafficking. In just the last 6 months, our joint patrols in Mexico have resulted in the arrest of more than 7,000—7,000—human smugglers. And we've seized more than 20,000 pounds of deadly fentanyl at the border. And today we've discussed how all three of us can continue to deepen and strengthen our shared efforts to cut off the flow of illegal fentanyl, including by tackling the precursor chemicals used in synthetic drugs as we go after the laboratories where they're made and the stash houses where they're stored.
We also talked about meeting our commitments to make North America a clean energy powerhouse—and I believe that's within our grasp—and a global leader in addressing the climate crisis.
That means working together to promote zero-emissions vehicles, to build charging stations for electric vehicles that are compatible across our international borders. It means exploring shared markets for clean hydrogen. And it means working together to meet our ambitious commitments under the Paris Agreement, including tackling methane and black carbon.
And finally, as three vibrant democracies, we recognize our greatest strength is our people. Let me say that again: Vital democracies we are, and our greatest strength are our people, the strength of our people.
And a key to our competitive edge in the world is our incredible diversity. So, together, we're working to address the inequities that for too long have plagued historically marginalized communities in each of our nations to make sure everyone gets a fair shot. It's one of the smartest investments we can make for our future, and we're going to make it together.
So, Mr. President and Mr. Prime Minister, I'm honored to stand with you today. And I am grateful to have both of you as partners and, I might add, friends as we work together to realize a shared vision for North America.
Thank you very much.
Moderator. Let's give the floor to His Excellency, the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau.
Prime Minister Trudeau. Bonjour. Good afternoon. Buenas tardes, President López Obrador, mi amigo. Thank you for having us here in Mexico City.
President Biden, my friend, thank you for all your hard work and your valuable insights in today's meetings.
As a continent, we are unique. We are three large democracies committed to freedom, human rights, equality, and creating real opportunity for everyone. We share deep ties as friends and trading partners.
[At this point, Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
During these 30 years, the economies of Mexico, U.S., and Canada have become closely tied because of NAFTA. This trade agreement helped our economies grow and created millions of good employments, and the trade amongst our borders drew investors from the world over.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]
Free trade through NAFTA has helped make our economies among the most competitive in the world. It makes sense why. Combined, we are home to half a billion people. And we have an extraordinarily strong innovation ecosystem. Our combined GDP is larger than that of the European Union. And, as leaders, we are all dedicated to driving economic growth that supports the middle class and those working hard to join it. These are all foundations of a strong and resilient continental economy.
People remember what happened just a few years ago when the certainty of this partnership was in question. Investors, businesses, workers, and citizens all worried about what would happen. When free trade is at risk, that isn't good for competition in the global market.
Thankfully, the belief in free and fair trade won the day. We renegotiated, and we got an even better deal. To put it simply, we are and always will be stronger together.
The world today is facing a lot of uncertainty. With the rise in authoritarian leaders causing global instability and the high cost of living putting stress on families at home, it's important that we come together as leaders and as friends to look at ways to make our economies more resilient.
Today we discussed how we can build reliable value chains on this continent for everything from critical minerals to electric vehicles to semiconductors. This is good for workers, good for consumers, and good for communities across our countries.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
COVID-19 showed us the importance of supply chains and economic resilience, the importance of being prepared, being ready to face a new pandemic, and try to prevent it. Today we spoke about a way to improve our cooperation in the realm of health services in order to be ready to intervene.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]
We can boost our economic resilience even further through our work to build a clean economy. Things like clean energy, including hydrogen, manufacturing zero-emission vehicles, and encouraging more people to adopt them. This is an enormous opportunity for workers and for business.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
We should all be part of climate action. Government and private sector should work together to attain the 2030 goals and objectives. These goals are not only about reducing pollution to get to the Paris objectives, they have to do to our—with our engagements to preserve 30 percent of our lands and oceans in 2030.
In last COP15 in Montreal, Canada, convened the countries around the world, and we reached a historic agreement to preserve and protect nature. This is essential for the health of the economy.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]
Canada is pleased to have our Mexican and American friends committed so strongly to protecting clean air, clean water, and a brighter future.
Canada is also pleased to see all three countries take steps to more—to build towards building a more diverse, equal, and inclusive society, a society where there is opportunity for everyone, where women and girls are politically and economically empowered, including Indigenous women and girls; where the benefits of growth are felt by workers and families across the economy. By doing this, we create a more stable, prosperous, and equal future, and we build economies that work for all North Americans.
We made progress on a lot of different things today. There's a lot going on in the world right now, and North—as North American leaders, we recognize the roles our countries play in being a source of stability and security, not just in the region, but around the world.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
This summit was extremely fruitful. We were able to reiterate our vision and the force of our partnership.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]
I know we'll make much progress in the coming year. And I look forward to hosting you both in Canada for the next North American Leaders' Summit.
Thank you. Merci. Gracias. 
Moderator. Let's give the floor to Mr. Andrés Manuel López Obrador, President of the United Mexican States.
President López Obrador. I want to thank, in a very sincere fashion, the participation of President Biden and the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, and also the participation of their respective wives, Jill—Doctor—Sophie. And I also want to thank their delegations and teams.
The mere fact of being here together today as good neighbors in this environment of respect to look for the well-being of our peoples in a joint manner is in itself a very important historic event, a true happening.
Nonetheless, I wanted to highlight that we've agreed on strengthening our economic, trade, commercial relations. And for that, we're going to be creating a joint committee aimed at planning and substituting imports in North America so that we may try to be increasingly self-sufficient in this part of the world and to turn development cooperation into a reality, as well as the well-being of all the countries of our continent. We want that to be a reality.
The United States, Canada, and Mexico will propose—each one of those countries will be proposing—four members for the formation, for the creation of this task force, of this committee of 12 specialists that not only know this issue we are going to be working on, but they will also have our absolute trust to motivate, to persuade, and invite the business community, workers, public servants of all three governments, and to convince them about the importance, the transcendence of being united in North America and for us to be able to seek from here on this unity in everything we do throughout the American continent.
On the part of Mexico in this group, we are going to be represented by Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard; Rogelio Ramírez de la O, Finance Minister of Mexico; Raquel Buenrostro Sánchez, who is the Secretary of Economy; and Alfonso Romo Garza, who represents the business community. He's an independent businessman, Mr. Romo is.
And we also discussed as a priority issue economic commercial trade; integration, as I have already expressed, of the entire American continent; and the well-being of the peoples; and the new relations of cooperation, leaving behind interventionism—hegemonic interventionism.
Let me do a set-aside here to express my acknowledgement, my recognition to Prime Minister Trudeau and President Biden for the way, which has been so solidary, in which they've acted, in which they are acting vis-a-vis the attempt of coup d'etat in Brazil. This shows that there's a commitment—authentic commitment in favor of democracy. Our support for President Lula of Brazil.
We have to—together, we have to be able to accomplish all this—everything that President Biden just said. We have to be able to accomplish this that is on equal footing for us to be treating each other as good neighbors, economic allies, and as friends.
We, of course, will be helping to turn this dream into a reality. And we are very enthused at the certainty that this is something we can accomplish. Peace is the result of justice. Social problems cannot be solved only with coercion measures. We should always attempt to discourage violence and the migration phenomenon with an approach—humanitarian approach of opportunities for the well-being of everyone.
People are good by nature. And it's circumstances that sometimes make it necessary for some ones to take the path of antisocial behaviors. We have seen this in Mexico and also in our sister countries, the countries of Honduras and El Salvador.
For instance, in our country, in Mexico, since corruption is not allowed and the budget is used for development and supporting the poorest sectors of our population, today we not only have jobs, employment, we have seen reductions in violence. We have less migration as well. And we've also tempered frustration. And what we can see is this flame—this flame—which is alive. I'm talking about the flame of hope. Peace is the fruit, it is the result, of justice.
The Central American case is exceptional. With just a few resources, we are helping producers in communities in Honduras and Salvador—El Salvador so that they can grow their land, so that they can grow their crops with technical assistance, support, and basic income.
And in those towns where we are applying those actions—particularly the program we call Sembrando Vida, which means ""sowing life,"" and Youth Building the Future Program—we've not just seen a reduction of people wanting to migrate to the United States seeking opportunities of better living conditions and jobs, but for many young people of those countries, crime has stopped being the only possibility of survival and the only way to move forward in life.
The migration issue, as many other issues, was discussed in a very broad fashion. And we reached important agreements among the three countries for the benefit of our peoples, as you will be able to see, as you will also be able to know, through a communique—a joint communique that we have that will be provided to you immediately.
Finally, I want to thank Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for his extraordinary and fraternal program that consists of granting temporary working visas for laborers, workers. This program is already benefiting 25,000 men and women—25,000 Mexicans. This is a path to follow that is orderly migration. Prime Minister Trudeau is a great ally of Mexico.
President Biden, I want to thank you sincerely for maintaining with Mexico a relationship of cooperation, of friendship—sincere friendship, sir—of respect for our fellow man who live and work in a very honest fashion in the United States who are not harassed. They're not suffering raids as it unfortunately used to happen in the past.
We have said this and I repeat it today—I insist on this: You, President Biden, you are the first President of the United States in a very long time that has not built not even 1 meter of wall. And that—we thank you for that, sir, although some might not like it, although the conservatives don't like it.
In a very special manner, I also want to say that I have requested in a very respectful manner, President Biden—I have requested on insisting—and I know that this is not a simple issue or matter, but it's a fair and very just matter. And that's why I'm proposing it. That's why I'm mentioning this. And also because I truly—I fully trust President Biden.
I've asked President Biden to insist before the U.S. Congress to regularize the migration situations of millions of Mexicans who have been in the States working, living in the United States, and contributing to the development of that great Nation, which is the United States of America.
I have reasserted, reaffirmed that President Biden is a man with convictions who maintains principles, ideals to guarantee, to ensure as many others—men, women in the United States and throughout the world—and the Statue of Liberty never, never, ever should become a symbol—a void, an empty symbol.
Let me conclude by saying that my professor, great poet, Carlos Pellicer—my master, my teacher—in 1930, he said that the wish of freedom, of liberty is the biggest fruit that has materialized that is in the heart of humans. To be doing that, we have to be free. The sentiments of justice are the children of freedom, of liberty. Never, ever being slaves can we—will we be able to be just and fair.
Thank you very much.
Moderator. Now let's begin a Q&A session. Ladies and gentlemen and the U.S. press; Your Excellency, Joseph Biden, Jr., President of the United States of America, yes, will take a question from a journalist, a reporter from the United States.
Please.
President Biden. All right. I was having trouble hearing, but I'd like to call on Associated Press, Colleen Long, for the first question.
Classified Documents Found in President Biden's Former Office/Immigration 
Q. Thanks, Mr. President. Hola, Señor. And hi, Prime Minister Trudeau.
For Mr. President, you've been accused of being too soft on border security and now too hard, following the recent border policy changes. What's the right balance?
And on the news at home, can you explain how classified documents ended up in one of your offices? And should the public get—have been notified sooner?
For Prime Minister Trudeau, there's been a suggestion that Canada lead a multinational security force in Haiti. I wondered if that was a possibility and what you would need.
Y señor, usted Presidente, muchas gracias por la bienvenida esta semana. Quiero preguntar: You said that you would accept—you would be willing to accept more migrants arriving to the U.S.-Mexico border. What do you want from the U.S. in return?
President Biden. I'll answer first?
Well, let me get rid of the easy one first. People know I take classified documents and classified information seriously.
When my lawyers were clearing out my office at the University of Pennsylvania, they set up an office for me—a secure office in the Capital, when I—the 4 years after being Vice President, I was a professor at Penn.
They found some documents in a box—you know, a locked cabinet, or at least a closet. And as soon as they did, they realized there were several classified documents in that box. And they did what they should have done: They immediately called the Archives—immediately called the Archives—turned them over to the Archives. And I was briefed about this discovery and surprised to learn that there were any Government records that were taken there to that office.
But I don't know what's in the documents. I've—my lawyers have not suggested I ask what documents they were. I've turned over the boxes—they've turned over the boxes to the Archives. And we're cooperating fully—cooperating fully—with the review, and—which I hope will be finished soon, and will be more detail at that time.
The first question, now I forgot. [Laughter] No. Your first question related to——
Q. I—yes, I asked if we—I asked if the——
President Biden. I'm only joking.
Q. Oh. [Laughter]
President Biden. The answer is—the answer is, you've got both—both the extremes are wrong. It's a basic middle proposition.
Now, look, as was mentioned by all of us in one way or another, this has been the greatest migration in human history around the world, as well as in this hemisphere. And when I got elected, the first thing I—the first major piece of legislation I introduced was to reform the immigration process, to make it more orderly, to make it more—to make sure people have access under the law.
And so what we found out—and not just in my visit to El Paso, but before that—we found out is that our Republican friends and some—a few Democrats—are very critical of what's going on at the border, but yet refuse to even look at the detail document I submitted for the Congress to consider to reform the process completely.
And so, number one, right now a majority of our migrants are coming from four countries: Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti, and Nicaragua. And we're expanding the very successful parole program we had, with regard to Venezuela, to Cuba and to Nicaragua and to Haiti to provide safe and orderly and humane processing for people fleeing those countries to come to the United States and claiming under the—seeking asylum.
This is going to reduce the number of people legally trying to cross—illegally trying to cross the border. Venezuelans were trying to enter the country. That they dropped—that has dropped off dramatically because we've allowed them to go directly to whatever country—the first country they go to, directly contact the United States, make sure that they make their application showing that they have—they do a background check; they, in fact, have access to a sponsor; and that they have been—they've been examined. And that way, they're able to come through ports of entry.
And it's dropped off—we have—I'm going to make sure I get the numbers right—dramatically from 1,100 persons trying to enter to—per day—to 250 a day.
I've asked the—and I want to thank the President of Mexico for agreeing to take up to 3,000 people back in as—that don't meet this criteria. Because, look, right now the cartels make a lot of money, which they use for drug trafficking as well. People go through—have to make it through jungles and a long journey to the border. And many are victimized, not only in terms of what they have to pay, but victimized physically in other ways.
And so we're trying to make it easier for people to get here, opening up the capacity to get here, but not have them go through that God-awful process.
And we're going to continue our efforts to address the root causes of migration to help people stay in their home countries. I've asked the Congress for $4 billion to provide for that. We've also had our Vice President provide for private donations of over $3 billion to make sure that people—look, all of you know all of us in the United States are immigrants. Mine go all the way back to the Irish famine. But the point is, all of us have been immigrants.
And one of the things that comes across fairly clearly is, it's not like people sit in their home city, county, town and say: ""I've got a great idea. Let's sell everything we have, give it to a coyote, go through some jungles and a long path up to the United States, smuggle us across the border, drop us in a desert. And won't that be fun in a country we don't even speak the language?""
We have—we can do more than merely just make legal immigration more streamlined. But we can also do it by preventing people from wanting to have to leave in the first place, by helping their communities, in fact, better their circumstances.
And so I hope—you know, and by the way, my proposals are supported by the Chamber of Commerce, by the American labor movement, not—I mean, which is an unusual coalition—and a whole range of people. The point here is that my Republican friends in Congress should join us in the solutions.
And the one last point I'll make—and I'm sorry to go on so long, but we spent a lot of time talking about it—is we have to increase the technological capabilities at the border, both to intercept illegal drugs and other contraband, as well as people being smuggled across the border.
We have now the ability to use, and use—some of you have seen them; I know you all, you have, I'm sure—these trucks that ride alongside of a tractor trailer. It's like a giant X-ray machine, and it can determine what's inside that tractor-trailer. And thousands cross the border every day in illegal commerce. And so we're allowed to determine whether or not there—fentanyl is in there, drugs in there, people being smuggled across the border.
We're going to provide significantly more of those vehicles for the people to be able to determine at the border what need—what—what is coming across legally and illegally.
A lot more to say, but I probably already said too much. Thank you.
Moderator. David Cochrane, CBC, from Canada, will be asking to Prime Minister Trudeau.
Prime Minister Trudeau. I'll take your question. And I'll fold the Haiti question in as well.
Q. Okay, thank you, Prime Minister. A question for you and for President Biden as well.
President Biden, you've talked a lot about economic cooperation and building continental supply chains and resilience here. But since you've been President, Canadians have seen what they consider to be protectionist—U.S. protectionism from you in things such as the Buy American Act. So what assurances can you give to Canadians and Mexicans watching this at home that they will be equal partners in the economic opportunity you're talking about in this transition and not have to confront further attempts at American protectionism?
President López Obrador, if you have anything to say on that, we'd love to hear it.
And, Prime Minister Trudeau, if you can answer the Haiti question, but also explain to us what steps your Government needs to take to take advantage of this opportunity on the continental supply chain resiliency to ensure that Canadian companies make things like semiconductors and don't just supply critical minerals to American companies.
Prime Minister Trudeau. Thank you very much. First, on Haiti, the situation in Haiti is heartbreaking. Canada has stood with the people of Haiti for decades, including over the past 3 years with multiple interventions with the U.N., with other partners on the ground; military interventions, police interventions, even prison guards.
We have continued to stand with the people of Haiti, and we will continue to. Obviously, this current situation is heart wrenching and we need to continue to be there for the people of Haiti. But we need to make sure that the solutions are driven by the people of Haiti themselves.
That's why Canada's focus, as we stepped up over the past months, has been, first of all, in putting significant sanctions on the elites who are responsible for so much of the violence and political instability in Haiti. A handful of small, extraordinarily wealthy families in Haiti have been causing much of the strife because of political and pecuniary interests. And that is why the sanctions that Canada has put forward are causing significant impacts on the ground.
We're also moving forward with significant supports for the Haitian National Police, including with armored vehicles—the Americans have stepped up on as well—to ensure that the police is able to stabilize the situation on the ground.
Obviously, there's much more to do. We've sent down a group of interlocutors to work both on the political side, but also to liaise directly with the security officials on the ground so that we can be responsive in immediate ways to what is needed for the Haitian National Police to get a better control and ensure greater stability for the people of Haiti.
The U.N. called in September for the free flow of food, medicines, water, and fuel. Much of that has started again. It's still not where it needs to be, but we're going to continue to lean in on ensuring that that happens.
But at the same time, we are working with partners across the Caribbean and, indeed, with the United States and Mexico to ensure that if the situation starts to deteriorate once again, we will have option","s.
But like I said, we're going to make sure that what we do this time allows for the Haitian people to get the situation under control. And a big part of that is putting those sanctions on the Haitian leadership that are responsible for so much of the misery people are going through.
In regards to the continental supply chain, that was at the center of our conversations throughout this North American Leaders' Summit. The idea that we already work extraordinarily well together with NAFTA, but there's so much more we can be doing at a time where supply chains around the world are under increasing stress and significant economic actors around the world are becoming less reliable as partners and less desirable as partners in building the technologies and the energy futures that we want.
That's why—you brought up a few examples of it—our critical minerals approach, a strategy that we just released a few weeks ago, is focused not just on mining the critical minerals that Canada has, that North America and the world needs, in responsible environmental partnership with Indigenous Peoples doing it the right way, but also the development, the processing, the transforming into batteries, the transforming into technology that goes along the value chain as something that is important for Canada.
And yes, it's something that we're continuing to look at. That's the same thing with electric vehicles, where we're building electric vehicles with our partners in Mexico and in the United States.
But Canada—again, from the critical minerals that go into the batteries and the batteries themselves that we're starting to build, to the steel and aluminum that is amongst the cleanest in the world being developed in Canada, to the technology, the innovation, from AI to engineering that is part of it—Canada is very much a partner in what we're developing in terms of more resilient supply chain. So there's lots more to do.
Indeed, even on semiconductors, the largest semiconductor packaging plant in North America, I believe, is in Bromont, Quebec. And packaging of semiconductors is actually how you assemble them into a unit that can then do the high-value calculations and computations that need to happen.
These are the kinds of things that Canada is very much focused on in ensuring not just prosperity right now, but good jobs as we move towards a environmentally responsible, net-zero, socially inclusive future that the middle class in all three of our countries are relying on.
Q. [Inaudible]
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Prime Minister Trudeau. Briefly, in French: In regard to Haiti, Canada has always been there to help the Haitian people, and we are working with our partners in the region to guarantee better solutions for the Haitian people. We have laid sanctions against the elites. We are helping the National Police in Haiti.
We have had good exchanges, good dialogues with our partners in the U.S. and Caribbean countries to guarantee that we will be able to preserve and to have the people of Haiti at the center of the solutions.
In regard to the economic integration and the competitiveness in North America, be it electric vehicles, be it Critical Minerals Strategy minerals, and the ones we're going to develop to produce the necessary technologies or in regard to any other technologies in order to work together, because we know that North America can offer many solutions, great competitiveness to the rest of the world, and we are a true force to reckon with in our continent.
Moderator. Sara Pablo of the Formula Group will pose a question to the constitutional President of the United Mexican States.
Q. Yes. Good afternoon, Presidents, Prime Minister. And we have a few questions for President Biden.
I know that recently you announced the United States will be receiving citizens from Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba, and Nicaragua. What is the timeframe? And are you thinking of expanding the number of people you will be receiving? And is this—some other nations could be included? And what is the amount in technological improvements in the United States?
And for President López Obrador: How will Mexico be prepared to receive all the migrants the United States will be expelling from its territory? And the new migration center in the southern part of Mexico, what is it all about?
And then, after this 10th summit, are we going to be seeing changes in migration policies in the way migrants are being treated?
And finally, let me—this is for President Biden: fentanyl. What concrete actions are you going to be implementing? What's the impact of the detention of Ovidio Guzmán? Because the Cartel of the Pacific is one of the main fentanyl producers.
And finally, another question on energy sector consultations. President Biden, Prime Minister Trudeau, did you discuss those discussions about the USMCA, the T-MEC?
President López Obrador. Very well. We did speak about migration in a very broad manner. Of course, there is cooperation with the U.S. administration. And at the same time, we have a commitment to protect migrants.
What President Biden has proposed is absolutely true. If migrants cross our country—and, in some cases, they also go through other countries in Latin America—to arrive in the United States, migrants are facing so many risks when they do that, starting with the fact that they are victims of the trafficants—the smugglers—the human traffickers known as the coyotes or polleros. And they charge migrants a high amount of money to take them northbound.
Now, those polleros or coyotes have networks. And at the same time, they hire trailers, trucks—truck trailers. The box of the trailer, they can transport up to 300, 400 people. So the—constant accidents are taking place on the highways of Mexico, the roads of Mexico, unfortunately.
And the worst of it all is that many migrants are being kidnapped by criminal groups, by criminals. They're being murdered. And this is very sad, very painful.
That's why I'm speaking about protection. We—what we want is an in-depth solution. We've always said that people—just as President Biden said, people do not leave their towns, their countries, their families because they like to do it. This is not a pleasure for them. They do it because of the needs they have. This is a necessity.
We've always said we have to look at the root causes of all this. We have to try for people to be able to work and be happy where they were born, where their relatives, their customs, their traditions, their cultures are. And we need to invest for that. We need to invest in development of the countries with more inequality and poverty, because migration has to be an optional thing, not a forced situation.
However, in the meantime—because we're, of course, doing everything we can to accomplish this—Mexico, with just a few resources, is helping. I have already mentioned that we are working—we are working with communities in El Salvador, in Honduras. We're going to be starting this in Guatemala and Belize as well.
However, we do need to promote development even more—and well-being—to ensure, guarantee opportunities for those that are forced to migrate and leave their communities.
We are not thinking of building any center in the southeastern part of Mexico—any migration center. We're not thinking of that. What we do is help with shelters, with health care services, with food services as well. That's the way we help migrants.
And we do celebrate the fact that the U.S. administration has taken—made the decision, rather, to have an orderly migration flow in the case, for instance, of our Venezuelan brothers and sisters. And I understand that this plan will also be extended—will be expanded to benefit other migrants, other countries.
We know for sure that since the announcement was made saying that those permits, humanitarian visas were going to be granted in the case, for instance, of the Venezuelan population, we've seen a decrease in migration flows, or people crossing Mexico to migrate.
This has been a considerable reduction because this was announced in the United States, and this was made public everywhere, saying that 24,000 humanitarian visas or permits were going to be granted and that the formalities had to be covered, the paperwork. Although there are some requirements that have to be met, people decided to do it. So what happened was that a new path has been opened; it didn't exist before.
Everything was arriving in the United States, risking everything—risking people's lives, of course, at the risk of their own lives. Now that this mechanism has been approved, people can file their own request. And this might take time. However, there's hope. A hope that this is—a purpose is going to be accomplished: the purpose of going to the United States to work, to live.
We celebrate this, and we think that—I insist what Canada is doing is also the right thing to do.
And I was talking about our own experience as well. And you can look at data. It's there for you to look at. Because of circumstances in the past, migration corresponded to the sister countries of Central America that were—those were the main migration flows from Central America—but, for a long time as well, Mexicans migrating who were going to look for a better living standard, who were going to look for a job in the United States.
And just imagine: There are 40 million Mexicans in the United States—40 million who were born here in Mexico, or they're the children of people who were born in Mexico.
Now, what have we been able to accomplish with all the support for well-being? We've reduced the number of Mexican migrants, yes. There are less migrants abandoning Mexico now because there's public investment; because out of 35 million families, 30 million families of Mexican families are now receiving at least a program—a well-being program. And this is a very direct manner of doing this here in Mexico.
All the senior citizens, 65 or over, receive a pension. This is a universal program in Mexico. Eleven million of senior citizens in Mexico are getting a pension. Eleven million students of low-income families, of poor families are getting grants. They're getting scholarships. All the boys and girls with disabilities also have their own pension.
We have a program for reforestation. It is the most important reforestation program in the world. And we are planting over 1 million hectares of fruit and timber trees. And we are giving jobs to over 400,000 peasants that are growing, planting those trees.
So, then, all these programs help so that people may be staying in their own communities, in their towns.
We built the Dos Bocas refinery—35,000 jobs. We are now building the Mayan train, which is the biggest railroad works in the world because it's 1,554 kilometers—1,554 kilometers—in five States of Mexico.
All the Maya region—which is one of the most important archaeological zones of the world—well, there, people are working, building this railroad system. About 300,000 people are building the train. So that's really the option. That's the path to follow: development, well-being.
And I insist, I repeat: I truly celebrate that the Canadian Government and the U.S. administration, as well, are now attending to the migration problem with this type of approach. It's quite lamentable that there are others—other politicians, other Presidents and public officials who are acting in a very inhuman manner.
Right now, in this winter season, for instance, with all due respect—I'm not saying this in a very direct manner, but what I'm saying is that, I mean, one of the Governors of our neighboring country headed a movement to take migrants to New York, to Washington, and just drop them there. This is politicking. This is completely inhuman. This should not be done. Because there are those who forget that we are all migrants.
How is it that that great nation, the United States, was developed? With migrants. Thanks to that, so then we have to continue seeking, looking for alternatives. Just as, for instance, also in the case of violence, we have to look into the root causes of violence.
And also in the case of our country, youth were never cared for. No services for young people. And the only thing that was done was call them young people who didn't work, who didn't study. This is a discriminatory labeling for youth. ""They don't study; they don't work."" Ninis, they were called in Mexico. They don't do one thing. They don't do the other thing either.
So no one was ever caring for our youth in Mexico. All those young people only had—the only option they had, I mean, was to migrate. And many migrated, acting in a respectful manner, a very responsible fashion. And others as well were trying to make a living because they didn't have any other opportunities. So they made a living in what we call the ""informal economy,"" which is, you know, making a living out in the street, no matter what. I mean, whichever way you can make a living without falling into illicit activities. However, unfortunately, many did go into the path of antisocial behaviors.
But we didn't really take care of young people in Mexico. However, we now have a program devoted to young people. This program never existed in the past. There are 2.4 million young people who are being hired. They are working, and they're apprentices.
What are we doing? We are taking away from them this culture, those seats, the reserves, the stock. We're taking that away from criminal groups. We're taking youth—we don't want our youth to be hooked. We don't want those criminal groups to be taking our youth away. We want to give them opportunities. That's exactly what we're doing in Mexico.
And let me conclude also highlighting another difference which is quite important: There is no corruption in the administration, the Government that I represent. There's no impunity either.
There's—we have painted this line that is very clear. Crime is one thing, and the authority is a different thing. There is no criminal association or partnership as before.
Yes, this is—we're even ashamed to mention this, that—to mention that those who were in charge of guaranteeing or ensuring public security were at the service—in the past—were at the service of criminal organizations. This doesn't happen in Mexico anymore.
That's why in this meeting, this summit we just held today, all three governments of the three countries, we have reached agreements to continue working together to get peace—to have peace in all three countries so that we can ensure and guarantee security of our peoples.
That's all I wanted to answer to your question, Madam.
Q. On fentanyl? On fentanyl and energy consultations?
President López Obrador. Yes, we are doing that. Just as I was telling you that in the case of migration, first there were brothers and sisters from Central America and also from Mexico, but now, in recent times, a lot of migrants from Venezuela, from Nicaragua, Colombia, Ecuador.
We do have a situation. This is a—these are changes in places where we're—places where people are being pushed to leave their towns, their place of origin for many reasons.
And with drugs, we have a case in point. It is not cannabis. It's not marijuana. It's not poppies—poppy. It's not only cocaine either. Now, we have fentanyl and chemicals, which are some of the most dangerous type of substance and very harmful for people because they are causing so many deaths.
So then, we're working on this in an organized manner. In the case of Mexico, this led us to make all the ports in the customs offices to be controlled by the armed forces in Mexico, all the sea customs office, because fentanyl and other chemicals come from Asia, and they are processed in labs. And we are avoiding the entrance of those chemical substances, and we are destroying labs.
The Navy Secretariat is in charge of managing ports and customs—sea customs offices. For instance, we had so much trafficking of chemicals in the port of Manzanillo and also in Lázaro Cárdenas. Now, the Navy is in charge of controlling those customs.
And all the customs, the land customs offices along the border line are now under the responsibility of the Ministry of Defense—National Defense Ministry.
So we are combating fentanyl and those chemicals, and we're doing this because we care. Nothing human is alien to us. We truly care being able to help and to be of help—the situation in the United States—deaths because of overdose of fentanyl.
And—but just as we discussed today, this is not only an issue of the United States. The thing is that if we do not face this problem, this scourge, we are going to suffer it ourselves as well. So we have to act in a coordinated fashion. And that is something we have been doing, and we discussed it in this summit. It is in the communique we are about to give you. And we are defending life—the life.
As I was telling you—I was telling Prime Minister Trudeau and President Biden—their teams, I was telling them as well: We only have two campaigns—publicity or propaganda campaigns—in the Government, in my administration. One is dedicated or devoted to not consuming drugs: ""Say no to drugs."" Because we have to also think of that. It became quite a famous thing—public fame. Everything related to gangs. They are even series of gangs and organized crime—gangs of organized crimes.
And this is like an apology of that which is desirable, because there are residences, very rich homes in those series, very luxurious homes, and the cars. Men and women—all very good looking—very handsome men and women well dressed with jewelry all over the place, with a lot of power. And they pick up the phone, and they call the head of the police force, head of the military, or even a President of a country. And that's what's being disseminated all over.
But we have seen a series on the damage caused by fentanyl, how, in 6 months, the life of a young person is destroyed. And what those doses contain, they have muriatic acid. Do people inform about the situation? Do people let other people know about this? No, of course not. So we are going to be launching an information campaign.
As I was telling the President and the Prime Minister, I said vapers—yes, they say: ""Well, they're not bad. I mean, they just have five substances. That's it. But they're not bad.""
We did some research on this. Over 30 substances, harmful and cancer-causing substances in those devices people smoke with. However, because of the lobbying, corruption as well, the publicity or advertising management, then—this is being allowed.
And there are many parents and mothers, fathers who don't even know the damage that their—our children are going through because of vapors. We have to look into this.
But, really, this is not only the responsibility of the Government, this is also the responsibility of the media. You can also help us so much on this to, you know, spread the word, to inform people. Radio stations, television networks—they should be devoting time for this to inform people, to guide people on this on how bad drugs can be for people's health and that people can be successful and they can be happy without having, without needing to fall into drug addiction, those mortal traps.
Well, all this, that's what we've been discussing. I think I'm taking more than the time that I should have taken. It's cold outside.
Thank you so much, everyone. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you. Thank you so much.
President Biden. I want the record to show: I don't know what questions I didn't answer. I'm prepared later. Thank you very much. [Laughter]"

Prime Minister Trudeau. Good afternoon, everyone.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]
It is a real pleasure to welcome my friend President Biden, Joe, to Canada this week.
We had the opportunity to discuss the progress made under the February 2021 Roadmap for a Renewed U.S.-Canada Partnership, a plan our countries put forward a month after the President was sworn in.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Today, with President Biden, we've made progress on several important files. And I'd like to mention some of our common priorities: growing the middle class, strengthening the economy, making life more affordable for people, fighting climate change and protecting the environment, protecting our citizens and our values.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]
In this serious time, with all the challenges we face, we're doubling down on our partnership and on our friendship.
As I said earlier today, economic policy, climate policy, and security policy aren't just connected; they're one in the same. Both the President and I agree on this, and that's why we launched a joint Energy Transformation Task Force that will accelerate our work on clean energy and clean tech.
This will include securing and strengthening electric vehicle and critical mineral supply chains and other areas to advance our collective energy security. Of course, an integrated approach means creating good middle class jobs for workers on both sides of the border, and it will make our collective economic growth stronger and more resilient.
Securing and developing critical mineral supply chains is essential to making things like batteries, computers, phones, and semiconductors.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Canada and the United States have agreed to put in force a system for building semiconductors. And so I'd like to announce today that we have signed an agreement with IBM to extend to the ability and capacity for the installations in Bromont, Quebec, to develop new capacity.
Demand is on the rise, as is competition. Canada's investment in semiconductors, which will be up to $250 million, will make it possible to enhance the competitivity of the North American economy, create jobs for the middle class, and to draw on Canadian talent, in addition to reducing pollution.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]
In addition to cutting pollution and fighting climate change, the President and I also worked on protection—protecting more nature as well.
Canada and the U.S. share the longest land border in the world. We share three oceans and the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes are a source of drinking water for 40 million people, and this shared resource needs to be protected. This is why Canada will make a major new investment of $420 million to continue safeguarding the Great Lakes for generations to come.
Whether it's on protecting our shared waters, including in the Arctic, conserving biodiversity, or building strong net-zero economies, Canada and the U.S. will continue to work together as partners.
We'll also continue to work together as partners to keep our people safe. Keeping people safe also includes keeping asylum seekers safe, keeping our borders secure, and keeping our immigration system strong.
Both of our countries believe in safe, fair, and orderly migration; refugee protection; and border security. This is why we will now apply the Safe Third Country Agreement to asylum seekers who cross between official points of entry. After midnight tonight, police and border officers will enforce the agreement and return irregular border crossers to the closest port of entry with the United States.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
When the agreement comes into force as of midnight tonight, border officers will return people crossing the border to the closest Canada-U.S. border crossing.
Our teams have worked hard to achieve this agreement. All of the work will make it possible to deter irregular immigration at our borders while at the same time we increase regular migration and immigration.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]
Keeping people safe is always our top priority.
Last year, I had the opportunity to visit NORAD personnel in Colorado. NORAD plays a central role in detecting, deterring, and defending against aerospace threats to our shared continent. NORAD has protected North America for over 60 years, and we're continuing our work to meet the evolving security challenges we face today.
Canada is making major investments to modernize surveillance systems. And on top of that, we will invest to modernize and build new infrastructure to support the arrival of our 88 new F-35 fighter jets so that, most importantly, we can support our men and women in uniform who keep us safe. This bolsters Canada's defense abilities for the coming decades.
Of course, protecting our countries also means continuing our work to make our borders more secure and keep people safe. The opioid overdose crisis is having devastating consequences in our communities. We're going to disrupt the cross-border movement of chemicals used in the illegal production of fentanyl.
Canada and the United States will build a global coalition against synthetic drugs. We must stop the traffic of synthetic opioids while at the same time focusing on a public health response.
If we want to keep Canadians and Americans safe at home, we have to continue defending our values around the world, values like democracy, the rule of law, and respect for the international rules-based order. Today we reaffirmed our steadfast support for the Ukrainian people as they defend themselves against Putin's brutal, barbaric invasion.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
We also talked about other parts of the world that are experiencing difficulties, like Haiti. As I said, Canada will keep Haiti in the heart of the solution for resolving this crisis.
Today I'm announcing that Canada will invest an additional $100 million to provide better police support to the National Police Force in Haiti. We will also impose additional sanctions on two other members of the Haitian elite who are benefiting from insecurity and violence. We are determined to increase international support for Haiti, including through humanitarian assistance.
President Biden and I had very productive meetings. As I said a little earlier, our economic measures are also climate measures, security measures. The President recognizes the importance of acting on all of these fronts.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]
Mr. President, the last time we stood together in this very room, you were the outgoing Vice President, and we were embarking upon some challenging times in our relationship as a country—as two friends and countries.
I have to say, through our conversations back then, through the work we've been able to do over these past 2 years, it has truly been an honor to be able to work with you for the benefit of Canadians and Americans, but also to continue to have a positive impact on the world in a very uncertain time.
And your speech in Parliament a few minutes ago was filled with optimism, grounded in a deep faith in people and the character of the citizens we serve and their ability to step up and meet the challenges before us. Like we have for many years, we will continue to work shoulder to shoulder as allies and friends to build a better future for Canadians and Americans alike.
It is always a pleasure to stand beside you. It is always a pleasure to work with you. Right now it's a pleasure to hand it over to you, Joe.
President Biden. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Prime Minister. And I can't think of a challenge we haven't met together when we sought to do it together.
[President Biden cleared his throat.]
Excuse me.
U.S. Military Operations in Syria 
Before I speak of the progress of this trip, I was informed by my national security team, on the way over here, that—about an attack in Syria yesterday. An Iranian-backed militant group used an unmanned aerial vehicle to strike one of our facilities, causing several American casualties. One of our citizens tragically died in that attack.
And, on the flight up yesterday, I spoke with our national security team and ordered an immediate response. Last night U.S. military forces carried out a series of airstrikes in Syria targeting those responsible for attacking our personnel.
My heart and deepest condolences go out to the family of the American we lost, and we wish a speedy recovery for those who are wounded. But I'm also grateful for the professionalism of our servicemembers who so ably carried out this response.
And to make no mistake: The United States does not—does not, I emphasize—seek conflict with Iran, but be prepared for us to act forcefully to protect our people.
That's exactly what happened last night. And we're going to continue to keep up our efforts to counter terrorist threats in the region, in partnerships with Canada and other members of the Coalition To Defeat ISIS.
Canada-U.S. Relations 
Now, let me get to today's business.
It's wonderful to be back in Canada. I'm honored I had a chance to address Parliament this afternoon. They were very patient, and I appreciate it.
And you know, a little over 75 years ago, in his own address to Parliament, President Truman said, ""No [Our; White House correction] two nations are called upon to make great contributions to the world's rehabilitation."" And, well, we are making great contributions to the world's rehabilitation, in my view.
Today, as we stand at—as I said today—an inflection point in history, our nations are once again called upon to lead. And together, I believe we're answering the call.
First, we've unleashed an economic potential of our people and our partnership, a partnership that generates more than $2.5 billion in trade every single day. Secondly, we're transforming our hemisphere into a clean energy powerhouse, including extending the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits to electric vehicles assembled in Canada. And as we discussed over the last 2 days, we're also strengthening our supply chains for critical minerals and semiconductors that power our everyday lives. And today we're making a—$50 million available through the Defense Production Act to incentivize more U.S. and Canadian companies to invest in packaging of these semiconductors and printed circuit boards.
I also want to emphasize what I said earlier in Parliament: that Canada and the United States always will have each other's backs. And we see this through NORAD as we work to modernize the world's only—and I emphasize it again—the only binational military command. There's none other in the world.
And we see it through NATO, where we're ensuring that we can meet any threat.
And over the last year, we've seen it through our strong and unified support for the brave people of Ukraine, to which the Prime Minister spoke so masterfully today in the Parliament. And stepping into—up to provide critical humanitarian aid, as well as security assistance. And for Canada's embrace of Ukrainian refugees.
And as we head into the second year of Russia's brutal invasion, our unity is not going to break. We're going to keep the pressure on Putin through our historic sanctions and tariffs. And we're going to continue providing Ukraine with training, equipment, humanitarian assistance it needs and to defend itself against Russian aggression.
And finally, as we deepen the global cooperation, we're also expanding our regional collaboration. As we discussed today, we're doubling down on our work to disrupt synthetic drugs, which have claimed too many American and Canadian lives. By bolstering our work together in the North American Drug Dialogue with Mexico and building on a new global coalition against synthetic opioids, we're working to get these killer drugs like fentanyl out of our communities.
And together, under the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection—and the Prime Minister has already spoken to it—we're also making good on our commitment to address the historic levels of migration in our hemisphere. Since we created dedicated pathways in the United States, the number of migrants arriving on our southern border has dropped precipitously. And I commend Canada for stepping up with a similar program, opening new legal pathways for up to 15,000 migrants to come to Canada from countries in the Western Hemisphere.
Mr. Prime Minister, Canada and the United States has always been partners in progress. And today, we're once again called to lead. I know that the United States can count on Canada to be our friend, doing the hard work, doing the historic work, doing the work that matters, and we're doing it together.
I truly believe we'll only make—we're going to make some great contributions. And I am optimistic about the future. And that's not hyperbole. I'm optimistic. I really am. We're going to make a better future for the people of Canada and the American people and, in consequence, for the whole hemisphere and around the world.
Thank you.
Moderator. Thank you, Mr. President, Prime Minister.
We'll be taking two questions from the American delegation, two questions from the Canadian delegation. One question and one follow-up.
Mr. President, first question over to you.
President Biden. All right. I guess the first person I'm calling on is Josh [Josh Boak, AP]. Josh—[inaudible]. Josh.
China-Russia Relations 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Two questions, one for each of you.
Mr. President, you talked today about the security and economic partnership with Canada. President Xi just went to Russia and expanded China's economic commitment with that country. Why do you think many leading countries are choosing to form competing partnerships? And what does that mean for the world?
President Biden. It——
Q. Prime Minister Trudeau——
President Biden. Oh, sorry.
Q. ——Canada recently banned TikTok on Government devices. Knowing what you know, are you comfortable with the idea of your children or family members using TikTok? Thank you.
President Biden. I respond to the question first here?
Well, first of all, look, in 10 years, Russia and China have had 40 meetings. Forty meetings.
And I disagree with the basic premise of your question. I have—we have, you know, significantly expanded our alliances. I haven't seen that happen with China and/or Russia or anybody else in the world.
We're in a situation in the United States where NATO is stronger, we're all together—the G-7, the Quad, the ASEAN, Japan and Korea.
I have—my staff pointed out to me: I have now met with 80 percent of the world leaders just since I've been President. We're the ones expanding the alliances. The opposition is not.
Name for me where that's going, and tell me what—I don't mean literally you, but rhetorically—tell me how, in fact, you see a circumstance where China has made some significant commitment to Russia. And what commitment can they make, economically? Economically.
Q. Their trade has increased, sir.
President Biden. Pardon me?
Q. Their trade has increased, sir.
President Biden. Yes, their trade has increased compared to what?
Look—look, I don't take China lightly. I don't take Russia lightly. But I think we vastly exaggerate.
I would hear—I've been hearing now for the past 3 months about ""China is going to provide significant weapons to Russia, and they're going to""—you all have been talking about that. They haven't yet. Doesn't mean they won't, but they haven't yet.
And if anything's happened, the West has coalesced significantly more. How about the Quad? How about Japan and the United States and South Korea? How about what we've done in terms of AUKUS? How about what we—I mean, so I just want to put it in perspective. I don't take it lightly what Japan—what China, excuse me, and Russia are doing. And it could get significantly worse.
But let's put it in perspective: We are uniting coalitions—we—we, the United States and Canada.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]
Prime Minister Trudeau. On TikTok, we made a similar decision to the American Government and others when we said that we do not feel that the security profile is safe for Government-issued phones. There are concerns around privacy and security, and that means—that is why we have banned TikTok from Government-issued phones.
But your question, Josh, was about what I do as a parent of teenagers and my kids on social media. And on that, I——
President Biden. Pray.
Prime Minister Trudeau. [Laughter] On that, I am obviously concerned with their privacy and their security, which is why I'm glad that on their phones—that happen to be issued by the Government—they no longer access TikTok. [Laughter]
That was a big frustration for them. ""Really? This applies to us too, Dad?"" ""Yes, I just did that."" [Laughter]
But I think as parents, we are understanding, particularly of teenagers, just how much of our kids' lives are lived online and how much they are impacted not just by—influenced the way their friends are and peer pressure that all of us went through as teenagers, but a degree of misinformation, disinformation, and malicious activity that is allowed for by incredible advances in technology that we are benefiting from in so many different ways.
As governments, we have to make sure we're doing what we can to keep people safe in the public square, making sure we're pushing back against hate speech and incitations to violence online. And we're carefully calibrating legislation to do that.
As a parent, I spend a lot of time talking to my kids about what's online and how they should try and, you know, go outside and play a little more sports and not get so wrapped up in their phones. And we're going to continue to do that.
Our concerns around TikTok are around security and access to information that the Chinese Government could have to Government phones.
It's just a personal side benefit that my kids can't use TikTok anymore—that I recommend everyone to use my—my encouragement to try and do.
[The moderator, a reporter, and Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and their remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Moderator. We'll now go to a Canadian question. Christian Noel [Radio-Canada].
Q. Good afternoon, Mr. President. Good afternoon, Mr. Prime Minister. I'd like to ask a question about Roxham Road. The agreement has been ready for a year. Why did you wait so long?
And for the 15,000 migrants that Canada will welcome, why so few? What have we offered to the U.S. in exchange?
Prime Minister Trudeau. Thank you, Christian. We've known for a long time theoretically what modernization needed to be made to the Roxham Road, to the agreement. We couldn't simply shut down Roxham Road and hope that everything would resolve itself, because we would have had problems. The border is very long. People would have looked for other places to cross.
And so that's why we chose to modernize the Safe Third Country Agreement so that someone who attempts to cross between official crossings will be subject to the principle—the same principle as someone who should seek asylum in the first safe country they arrive at.
Now, for people who are coming from the U.S., that is where they should be asylum seekers, using this means of uniformly applying the agreement, which we knew theoretically would be the solution, but it takes complex processes to manage the border. It took months before we could move forward with the announcement. But by doing so, we protected the integrity of the system. And we're also continuing to live up to our obligations with respect to asylum seekers.
At the same time, we continue to be open to regular migrants, and we will increase the number of asylum seekers who we accept from the hemisphere—the Western Hemisphere—in order to compensate for closing these irregular crossings.
Thank you.
Haiti 
[The reporter spoke in English as follows.]
Q. Mr. President, this question is for you, but Mr. Trudeau——
[The reporter continued in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Please feel free, Mr. Trudeau, to answer as well.
Are you disappointed that Canada is not part or hasn't taken a bigger role in the multilateral forces in Haiti? And what would you like Canada to do more, in addition to the $100 million announced today?
President Biden. Well, no, I'm not disappointed. Look, this is a very, very difficult circumstance, the idea of how do we deal with what's going on in Haiti, where gangs have essentially taken the place of the Government, in effect. They run—they rule the roost, as the saying goes.
And so I think that what the Prime Minister has spoken about makes a lot of sense. The biggest thing we could do, and it's going to take time, is to increase the prospect of the police departments in Haiti having the capacity to deal with the problems that are faced. And that is going to take a little bit of time.
We also are looking at whether or not the international community, through the United Nations, could play a larger role in this event, in this circumstance. But there is no question that there is a real, genuine concern, because there are several million people in Haiti, and the diaspora could cause some real—how can I say it?—confusion in the Western Hemisphere.
And so—but I think that what the Prime Minister is suggesting, and we are as well going to be contributing, to see if we can both increase the efficiency and capacity of the training and the methods used by the police department, as well as seeing if we can engage other people in the hemisphere, which we've been talking to, and they're prepared to do some. So it's a work in progress.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Prime Minister Trudeau. For 30 years, Western countries have been involved in Haiti to try to stabilize the country, to try to help the Pearl of the Antilles. And the situation is atrocious. It's affecting the security of the people of Haiti. We must take action.
And we must keep the Haitian people in the approach that we build for security. And that's why the approach that we are working on with the U.S. involves strengthening the capacity of the Haitian National Police, bringing more peace and security and stability. This won't happen tomorrow. It will, of course, be a long process, but we will be there to support the capacity of the police in Haiti, the National Police.
At the same time, part of the insecurity and instability in Haiti is because of the Haitian elite, who have for too long benefited from the misery of the Haitian people. They work for their own political gain, their own personal gain. And this has prevented the country from recovering. And that's why we're proceeding with sanctions. We will continue to bring pressure to bear on the elite, the political class in Haiti, to hold them accountable for the distress facing the Haitian people, but to hold them accountable for ensuring their well-being.
We're going to continue to work together. We fully understand how important this task is.
Moderator. Mr. President, over to you.
President Biden. Can I follow up with one point on Haiti? And that is that any decision about military force, which—it's often raised, we think would have to be done in consultation with the United Nations and with the Haitian Government. And so that is not off the table, but that is not in play at the moment.
I'm sorry.
Moderator. Over to you for the question, Mr. President.
Jordan [Jordan Fabian, Bloomberg News], you have a question?
Wall Street/U.S. Banking System 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Some on Wall Street have expressed frustration that it's unclear what more your administration is willing to do to resolve the banking crisis. The markets have remained in turmoil. So how confident are you that the problem is contained? And if it spreads, what measures, such as guaranteeing more deposits, are you willing or not willing to take?
President Biden. First of all, have you ever known Wall Street not in consternation? Number one.
Look, I think we've done a pretty damn good job. People's savings are secure, and even those beyond the $250,000 the FDIC is guaranteeing them. And the American taxpayer is not going to have to pay a penny. The banks are in pretty good shape. What's going on in Europe isn't a direct consequence of what's happening in the United States.
And I—what we would do is, if we find that there's more instability than appears, we'd be in a position to have the FDIC use the power it has to guarantee those loans above 250, like they did already.
And so I think it's going to take a little while for things to just calm down. But I don't see anything that's on the horizon that's about to explode. But I do understand there's an unease about this. And these mid-sized banks have to be able to survive, and I think they'll be able to do that.
Canada-U.S. Trade 
Q. And, Mr. Prime Minister, the U.S. has included Canada in electric vehicle subsidies, as you've discussed, that were included in the Inflation Reduction Act. But the IRA also raises some competitiveness concerns and challenges for Canada. President Biden supports ""Buy American"" provisions very strongly, and that has historically led to some trade tensions.
So are you planning to announce anything in your budget to keep up, so to speak? And are you asking the U.S. Government for exceptions to the ""Buy American"" provisions in other areas?
Prime Minister Trudeau. First of all, there's nothing new about Canada having to make sure that we remain competitive with the United States as a place for investment. That's something that we have long known as a friendly competition between us that has led to tremendous growth and benefits in both of our countries.
Right now we're in a time where—Joe talked about it as an inflection point; I think that's exactly right. We can feel the global economy shifting, shifting in very real ways towards lower carbon emission technologies, cleaner tech, great jobs in the natural resource and manufacturing industries that are going to be increased on our continent after years of outsourcing and offshoring. There is a real opportunity for both of us.
And the IRA, which is bringing in massive investments and massive opportunities for American workers and companies, is also going to have strong impacts on supply chains and producers and employees in Canada.
Yes, we're going to have to make sure we're staying competitive and targeting the areas where we think we can best compete. And we'll have more to say about that in our budget next week.
But let us take a moment to step back and see that North America—Canada and the United States in particular—are incredibly well positioned to be the purveyors of solutions and economic growth that the net-zero economy around the world will need over the coming decades. The innovation, the know-how, the ability of us to make big things together leave us, in a time of global uncertainty, extremely certain that we are well placed for the future.
Whether it's investments that have seen Canada go from fifth or sixth in the world, in turn of—in terms of battery supply chains, to now second in the world in terms of battery supply chains. Whether it's continuing our leadership on the cleanest aluminum in the world, moving towards cleaner steel and zero-emission steel.
Whether it's moving forward on critical minerals that the world is understanding they can no longer rely on places like China or Russia for—that they can rely on Canada to be not just a purveyor of ores, but of finished materials that will be built in environmentally responsible, union or good middle class jobs—wages, strong communities, and the kind of leadership that the world is increasingly looking for.
There's long been a bit of a weakness, I think, to our argument that we've made over the past decades as Western democracies that says that our model is the best one, it leads to the most prosperity. But so much of our model—we sort of turned our back to the fact that it relied on cheap imports——
President Biden. Bingo.
Prime Minister Trudeau. ——of goods or resources from parts of the world that didn't share our values and weren't responsible on the environment or on human rights or on labor standards.
And what we are doing right now is showing that we can and will build resilient supply chains between us and with friends around the world that adhere every step of the way to the values that we live by, that make sure that there are good jobs for workers in communities, urban and rural, right across our continent; there are good careers for kids long into the future, not in spite of a changing world, but because of that changing world, and how well we are positioned to see the future and meet the future.
That's why it's so exciting to be able to work alongside Joe in these challenging times where we know we are better positioned than just about anyone else. And those friends of ours who share our values and our democracies around the world will benefit from the strength and the relations they have with us. And those who choose to continue to turn their backs on the environment, on human rights, on the values of freedom and dignity for all, will increasingly not be able to benefit from the growth that our societies, that our communities are creating every single day.
President Biden. And by the way, we each have what the other needs. We each have what the other needs.
The idea that somehow Canada is some","how put at a disadvantage—because we're going to probably be investing billions of dollars in their ability to package what is coming out of the semiconductor area—I don't get it. How's that in any way do anything other than hire and bring billions of dollars into Canada?
I also don't understand how, when we talk about it, we—we greatly need Canada, in terms of the minerals that are needed. Well, you guys—we don't have the minerals to mine. You can mine them. You don't want to produce—I mean, you know, turn them into product. We do.
I mean, it's—I'm a little confused, at least thus far, on why this is a disadvantage for Canada and the United States. I think we each have what the other needs.
And let me conclude by saying: You know, when I started talking about we're going to build our economies from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down, I was being literal. Because what happened is, if you think about it—in Democrat and Republican administrations beginning over 30 years ago or more in the United States—corporate America decided that what they're going to do is they're going to export jobs and import product because it was cheaper labor.
Well, guess what? Now we are making sure they import jobs here—jobs here—and we export product. Canada is doing the same thing.
So this is a real shift in the world economy, in terms of what we're prepared to do. And I'll be darned if I'm going to stick in a situation where, as long as I'm President, where we have to rely on a supply chain in the other end of the world that is affected by politics, pandemics, or anything else.
We're not hurting anyone in terms of having access to the start of the supply chain. It's available.
But again, I predict to you, you're going to see, after we're both out of office, both China—I mean, China out of the game, in terms of many of the—the product they're producing, and the United States and Canada pretty solid economically situated for the future in terms of also bringing back manufacturing jobs.
Moderator. Merci.
President Biden. Sorry. And they're telling me I'm talking too long because we've got to go to dinner. [Laughter]
Moderator. Thank you.
[The moderator spoke in French, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
We'll take one last question.
Q. My first question is for the Prime Minister. But, Mr. President, feel free to weigh in before my follow-up.
Prime Minister, we know you've—we know that you've appointed a Special Rapporteur, but with what we've learned about Han Dong's communication with the Chinese Consular General, do you believe he advocated for the delayed release of the two Michaels?
Prime Minister Trudeau. First of all, Han gave a strong speech in the House that I recommend people listen to, and we fully accept that he is stepping away from the Liberal caucus in order to vigorously contest these allegations.
But I do want to take a step back and point out that foreign interference, interference by authoritarian governments like China, Russia, Iran, and others is a very real challenge to our democracies and is absolutely unacceptable. It's why, over the past number of years, the President and I have had many conversations about this. And indeed, we'll continue to work together with our democratic allies around the world to keep our institutions and our democracies safe from foreign interference.
In 2018, when Canada hosted the G-7 in Charlevoix, we actually created the G-7 Rapid Response Mechanism to protect our democracies in cases of interference. And we will continue to work together to make sure we're doing everything necessary to protect our democracies, which, by definition, are more open and therefore more vulnerable to foreign actors trying to weigh in in our politics, in our business, in our research institutions, and particularly impact on citizens themselves, which is why, over the past years, Canada, like our allies around the world, has given itself new rigorous tools to counter foreign interference.
And with the work that our expert Rapporteur will do, with the work that our National Security Committee of Parliamentarians will be doing, and other institutions, we will continue to do everything necessary to keep Canadians safe.
President Biden. I have nothing to add. [Laughter]
Willow Oil Drilling Project in Alaska 
Q. Thank you. And, Mr. President, when you took office, you canceled the Keystone XL pipeline. This week, your Government delayed the environmental assessment to reroute Enbridge Line 5, and at the same time, you're approving oil drilling in Alaska.
So what's your response to people who say it's hypocritical to stymie Canadian energy projects while allowing your own?
President Biden. First of all, I don't think it is, but I'll be very brief.
The difficult decision was on what we do with the Willow Project in Alaska, and my strong inclination was to disapprove of it across the board. But the advice I got from counsel was that if that were the case, we may very well lose in court—lose that case in court to the oil company—and then not be able to do what I really want to do beyond that, and that is, conserve significant amounts of Alaskan sea and land forever.
I was able to see to it that we are literally able to conserve millions of acres—not a few—millions of acres of sea and land forever so it cannot be used in the future.
I am banking on—we'll find out—that the oil company is going to say not—that's not going to be challenged, and they're going to go with three sites. And the energy that is going to be produced they're estimating would account to 1 percent—1 percent—of the total production of oil in the world.
And so I thought it was a good—a—the better gamble and a hell of a tradeoff to have the Arctic Ocean and the Bering Sea and so many other places off limits forever now. I think we put more land in conservation than any administration since Teddy Roosevelt. I'm not positive of that, but I think that's true.
Q. So why are you delaying efforts then?
Moderator. Thank you all. This is where concludes today's press conference.
President Biden. Thank you.
Q. Mr. President, are you concerned about—[inaudible]?
Q. Mr. President, do you have an opinion on the Manhattan grand jury probably indicting your predecessor?
Iran 
Q. Mr. President, Iran keeps targeting Americans. Does there need to be a higher cost, sir?
President Biden. We are not going to stop."
